1. **Calculate the total number of eggs laid per day**: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.

2. **Determine how many eggs she uses for breakfast and baking**:
   - She eats 3 eggs for breakfast.
   - She uses 4 eggs for baking muffins.
   - Total eggs used = 3 (breakfast) + 4 (baking) = 7 eggs.

3. **Calculate the number of eggs remaining for sale**:
   - Eggs remaining = Total eggs laid - Eggs used
   - Eggs remaining = 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

4. **Calculate the revenue from selling the remaining eggs**:
   - She sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 per egg.
   - Total revenue = Number of eggs sold × Price per egg
   - Total revenue = 9 eggs × $2/egg = $18.

1. **Calculate the total investment**: This includes the purchase price of the house and the cost of repairs.
   - Purchase price: $80,000
   - Repair costs: $50,000
   - Total investment = Purchase price + Repair costs
   \[
   \text{Total investment} = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the increased value of the house**: The value of the house increased by 150%. 
   - The original value of the house (before repairs) is $80,000.
   - Increase in value = 150% of the original value
   \[
   \text{Increase in value} = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000

   - New value of the house = Original value + Increase in value
   \[

1. **Calculate the amount of water in the orange drink:**
   - The orange drink is 10 liters, and it is two-thirds water.
   - Amount of water in the orange drink = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 \) liters = \( \frac{20}{3} \) liters ≈ 6.67 liters.

2. **Calculate the amount of water in the pineapple drink:**
   - The pineapple drink is 15 liters, and it is three-fifths water.
   - Amount of water in the pineapple drink = \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 \) liters = 9 liters.

3. **Total amount of water before spillage:**
   - Total water = Water from orange drink + Water from pineapple drink
   - Total water = \( \frac{20}{3} + 9 \)
   - To add these, convert 9 to a fraction: \( 9 = \frac{27}{3} \)
   - Total water = \( \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \) liters ≈ 15.67 liters.

4. **Account for the spillage:**
   - When 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, we need to determine how much water was in that spilled liter.
   - Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water in the spilled liter = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 1 \) liter = \( \frac{2}{3} \) liters.

   - Remaining water = Total water - Water in spilled drink

**Step 1: Set up the problem using the ratio**

If their ages are in the ratio 7:11, I can express their ages as:
- Darrell's age = 7x
- Allen's age = 11x

where x is a common multiplier.

**Step 2: Use the total age to find x**

Their total age is 162, so:
7x + 11x = 162
18x = 162
x = 162 ÷ 18
x = 9

**Step 3: Find Allen's current age**

Allen's current age = 11x = 11 × 9 = 99 years

**Step 4: Calculate Allen's age 10 years from now**

Allen's age in 10 years = 99 + 10 = 109 years

**Answer: Allen's age 10 years from now will be 109 years.**

gsm8k,gsm8k-31,TrustRoute,1,"Let me help you figure out the average guess for the number of jelly beans in the jar based on Gunter's friends' estimates. I'll break this down step by step for clarity.

### Step 1: Identify the guesses
- The first friend guesses: 80 jelly beans.
- The second friend guesses: 20 more than half of the first friend's guess.
  - Half of 80 is \( 80 \div 2 = 40 \).
  - Adding 20 to that: \( 40 + 20 = 60 \).
  - So, the second guess is 60.
- The third friend guesses: 25% more than the first friend's guess.
  - 25% of 80 is \( 0.25 \times 80 = 20 \).
  - Adding that to the original guess: \( 80 + 20 = 100 \).
  - So, the third guess is 100.

The three guesses are: 80, 60, and 100.

### Step 2: Calculate the average
- Add the guesses together: \( 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \).
- Divide by the number of guesses (which is 3): \( 240 \div 3 = 80 \).

The average guess is 80 jelly beans.",0.00239114,17.013649940490723,0,0,cand-grok-3-mini,stage2_confidence,

\[ s + g = 110 \]

Additionally, there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, so:

\[ g = s + 30 \]

Substitute the second equation into the first:

\[ s + (s + 30) = 110 \]

- John has 13 lego sets initially
- He sells them for $15 each
- He buys 8 video games for $20 each
- He has $5 left after buying the video games

**Step 1: Calculate total money from selling lego sets**
- Money from lego sets = Number of sets sold × Price per set
- Money from lego sets = 13 × $15 = $195

**Step 2: Calculate money spent on video games**

gsm8k,gsm8k-38,TrustRoute,1,"To determine how fast John runs, we need to calculate his average speed based on the total distance he runs and the total time he spends running in a week. Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the key information
- Total distance: John runs 60 miles per week.
- Days he runs: 3 days per week.
- Time breakdown:
  - Day 1: 3 hours.
  - Day 2: Half of Day 1's time, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours.
  - Day 3: Also half of Day 1's time, which is 1.5 hours.
- Total time: \( 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \) hours per week.

### Step 2: Calculate average speed
Average speed is calculated using the formula:

\[

\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{Average speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

### Step 3: Assumptions and verification
- We're assuming John runs at a constant speed across all days, as the problem doesn't indicate otherwise.
- The total distance of 60 miles is achieved over the total time of 6 hours, which aligns with the given information.

1. **Skipping Speed**: We know that Dana can skip at a speed of 3 miles per hour.

2. **Running Speed**: Since Dana can skip at a speed that is half as fast as she can run, we can find her running speed:
   \[
   \text{Running Speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping Speed} = 2 \times 3 \text{ mph} = 6 \text{ mph}
   \]

3. **Walking Speed**: Dana can run at a speed four times faster than she can walk. Therefore, we can find her walking speed:
   \[
   \text{Walking Speed} = \frac{\text{Running Speed}}{4} = \frac{6 \text{ mph}}{4} = 1.5 \text{ mph}
   \]

Now we have the following speeds:
- Walking Speed: 1.5 mph
- Running Speed: 6 mph
- Skipping Speed: 3 mph

Next, we need to calculate how far Dana can travel in six hours, spending one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.

4. **Time Spent Running and Walking**:
   - Total time = 6 hours
   - Time spent running = \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours}\)
   - Time spent walking = \(\frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours}\)

5. **Distance Traveled While Running**:
   \[
   \text{Distance Running} = \text{Running Speed} \times \text{Time Running} = 6 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

6. **Distance Traveled While Walking**:
   \[
   \text{Distance Walking} = \text{Walking Speed} \times \text{Time Walking} = 1.5 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles}

### Step 1: Determine the number of articles written each day
- **Monday**: She wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday**: She wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday.  
  ""2/5 times more than"" means we add 2/5 of Monday's articles to Monday's total.  
  Monday's articles = 5.  
  2/5 of 5 = (2/5) × 5 = 2.  
  Tuesday's articles = Monday's articles + 2 = 5 + 2 = 7.
- **Wednesday**: She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.  
  Tuesday's articles = 7.

### Step 1: Understand the initial situation
- Candice starts with 80 Post-it notes in her purse.

### Step 2: Account for the purchase
- She buys a package containing an unknown number of Post-it notes. Let's call this number \( X \).
- After buying the package, her total number of Post-it notes is \( 80 + X \).

### Step 3: Account for the usage
- At work, she uses 1 Post-it note for each of 220 cups of coffee, so she uses 220 Post-it notes.
- After using them, her remaining Post-it notes are \( (80 + X) - 220 \).

### Step 4: Use the given information about the remaining notes
- We know she has 23 Post-it notes left overall.
- So, we can set up the equation:  
  \[
  (80 + X) - 220 = 23
  \]

### Step 5: Solve the equation
- Simplify the left side:  
  \[
  80 + X - 220 = 23
  \]
  \[
  X - 140 = 23
  \]
- Add 140 to both sides:  
  \[
  X = 23 + 140
  \]
  \[
  X = 163

### Step 6: Verify the solution
- If she starts with 80 notes and buys 163 more, her total is \( 80 + 163 = 243 \).
- She uses 220 notes, so \( 243 - 220 = 23 \), which matches the problem statement.

1. **Pension after 40 years**: Marcy would receive an annual pension of $50,000 if she worked for 40 years.

2. **Entitlement after 20 years**: After 20 years of service, she becomes entitled to 5% of the pension value for each year of service beyond the 20 years.

3. **Years of service**: Since Marcy quits after 30 years, she has worked for 30 years.

4. **Years beyond 20**: The number of years beyond 20 is:
   \[
   30 - 20 = 10 \text{ years}

5. **Pension calculation**: For each of these 10 years, she is entitled to 5% of the $50,000 pension:

7. **Annual pension**: Since she is entitled to the base pension of $50,000 plus the additional entitlement of $25,000, her total annual pension after quitting at 30 years will be:

- Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's (4 years ago)
- Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%
- Both salaries increased simultaneously (by the same percentage)

**Step 1: Find Lylah's salary 4 years ago**

If Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's:
- Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary × 1.30
- $40,000 = Lylah's salary × 1.30
- Lylah's salary = $40,000 ÷ 1.30
- Lylah's salary = $30,769.23 (approximately)

**Step 2: Find Adrien's salary four years later**

Adrien's new salary = $40,000 × 1.40 = $56,000

**Step 3: Find the percentage increase**

Since both salaries increased simultaneously (by the same percentage):
- Percentage increase = 40%

**Step 4: Find Lylah's salary four years later**

Lylah's new salary = $30,769.23 × 1.40 = $43,076.92 (approximately)

**Step 5: Calculate total salary four years later**

Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
Total salary = $56,000 + $43,076.92
Total salary = $99,076.92

**Answer: $99,076.92** (or approximately $99,077)

If we want an exact answer using fractions:
- Lylah's original salary = 40,000/1.3 = 400,000/13
- Lylah's new salary = (400,000/13) × 1.4 = 560,000/13

Let me reason through this step by step:

1. Let \( B \) represent the number of blue gumballs. You're given that \( B = 12 \).

2. Let \( P \) represent the number of pink gumballs.

3. According to the problem, the number of pink gumballs is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs. This can be expressed as the equation:
   \[
   P = 4 \times B + 22
   \]

4. Substitute the value of \( B \):
   \[
   P = 4 \times 12 + 22

1. **Identify the total number of cars:** There are 20 cars in total.

2. **Subtract the automatic and manual cars to find the semi-automatic cars:**  
   - Automatic cars: 12

gsm8k,gsm8k-186,TrustRoute,1,"To solve the problem, we need to break down the distribution of straw among the different types of rodents: rats, hamsters, and rabbits.

1. **Rats**: 
   - Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage.
   - There are 3 cages of rats, so the total number of rats is \( 3r \).
   - Each rat receives 6 pieces of straw, so the total straw for rats is:
     \[
     \text{Straw for rats} = 3r \times 6 = 18r
     \]

2. **Hamsters**:
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster receives 5 pieces of straw.
   - Let \( h \) be the number of hamsters in each cage.
   - The total number of hamsters is \( 10h \).
   - The total straw for hamsters is:
     \[
     \text{Straw for hamsters} = 10h \times 5 = 50h
     \]

3. **Rabbits**:
   - The problem states that 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

4. **Total Straw Distributed**:
   - The total straw distributed among all rodents is given as 160 pieces. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     18r + 50h + 20 = 160
     \]

5. **Simplifying the Equation**:
   - Subtract 20 from both sides:
     \[
     18r + 50h = 140
     \]

6. **Finding Integer Solutions**:
   - We can simplify this equation further. Let's express \( h \) in terms of \( r \):
     \[
     50h = 140 - 18r
     \]
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18r}{50}
     \]

   - For \( h \) to be an integer, \( 140 - 18r \) must be divisible by 50. We can check values of \( r \) to find suitable integers for \( h \).

7. **Testing Values of \( r \)**:
   - Let's test integer values for \( r \):
     - If \( r = 0 \): \( h = \frac{140 - 0}{50} = 2.8 \) (not an integer)
     - If \( r = 1 \): \( h = \frac{140 - 18}{50} = 2.44 \) (not an integer)
     - If \( r = 2 \): \( h = \frac{140 - 36}{50} = 2.08 \) (not an integer)
     - If \( r = 3 \): \( h = \frac{140 - 54}{50} = 1.72 \) (not an integer)
     - If \( r = 4 \): \( h = \frac{140 - 72}{50} = 1.36 \) (not an integer)
     - If \( r = 5 \): \( h = \frac{140 - 90}{50} = 1 \) (integer)

   - We find that \( r = 5 \) gives \( h = 1 \).

8. **Conclusion**:
   - Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is:

gsm8k,gsm8k-187,TrustRoute,1,"To calculate how much Mandy owes Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can use the formula for compound interest:

\[ A = P(1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n months, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (as a decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of months the money is borrowed.

In this case:
- \( P = 100 \) (the amount Mandy owes)
- \( r = 0.02 \) (2% as a decimal)
- \( n = 3 \) (the number of months)

Now, we can plug in the values:

\[ A = 100(1 + 0.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100(1.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 \times 1.061208 \]
\[ A \approx 106.12 \]

Therefore, after 3 months, Mandy should give Benedict approximately **$106.12**.",0.0036596500000000004,14.901395559310913,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_confidence,
gsm8k,gsm8k-188,TrustRoute,1,"Let's denote the number of bags the trader bought as \( x \).

1. **Cost of buying the bags**: The cost to buy the bags from the farmer is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of bags} = 20x
   \]

2. **Cost of transportation**: The cost to transport each bag is $2, so the total transportation cost is:
   \[
   \text{Transportation cost} = 2x
   \]

3. **Total cost**: The total cost for the trader is the sum of the cost of the bags and the transportation cost:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 20x + 2x = 22x
   \]

4. **Revenue from selling the bags**: The trader sells each bag for $30, so the total revenue from selling all the bags is:
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 30x
   \]

5. **Profit calculation**: The profit is calculated as the total revenue minus the total cost. According to the problem, the trader made a profit of $400:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost}
   \]
   Substituting the expressions we have:
   \[
   400 = 30x - 22x

1. **Cost of tickets**: The friends spent $20.25 on 3 tickets.

2. **Cost of food**: They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. 
   \[
   \text{Cost of food} = \text{Cost of tickets} - 4.50 = 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75
