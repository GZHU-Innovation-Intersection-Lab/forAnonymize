### Explanation:
- **Input Validation**: I added a simple check to ensure the number is between 1 and 1000, raising an error if not. This makes the function more robust, even though the problem assumes valid input.
- **Conversion Logic**: The function uses a greedy algorithm to match the largest possible Roman numeral values first. It iterates through the predefined lists of values and symbols, appending symbols to a list until the number is reduced to 0.
- **Output**: The result is joined into a single string and converted to lowercase as required.
- **Examples**:
  - `int_to_mini_roman(19)` returns `'xix'`.
  - `int_to_mini_roman(152)` returns `'clii'`.

    else:

```

### Explanation:
- **Helper Function `is_balanced(s)`**: This function iterates through the string and maintains a balance counter. It increments for '(' and decrements for ')'. If the balance goes negative at any point, the string is not balanced. At the end, the string is balanced only if the balance is zero.
- **Main Function `match_parens(lst)`**: It extracts the two strings from the list and checks if either concatenation (`str1 + str2` or `str2 + str1`) results in a balanced string using the helper function.
- **Edge Cases Handled**: 
  - If the list doesn't contain exactly two strings, it returns 'No'.
  - Empty strings are handled correctly: An empty string is considered balanced, so `match_parens(['', ''])` returns 'Yes'.

You can test this function directly in a Python environment. For example:

print(match_parens(['()(', ')']))  # Output: Yes

humaneval,HumanEval/116,Cascade,1,"It looks like you're providing a function stub for `sort_array` and asking me to implement it based on the description in the docstring. The docstring specifies that the array consists of non-negative integers and should be sorted primarily by the number of ones in their binary representation (in ascending order), with ties broken by the decimal value. However, the examples include negative numbers, which seem to be sorted in ascending order.

To resolve this, I'll implement the function as follows:
- Separate the array into negative and non-negative numbers.
- Sort negative numbers in ascending order (as shown in the examples).
- Sort non-negative numbers based on the specified criteria: first by the number of ones in their binary representation, then by their decimal value if there's a tie.
- Combine the results, with sorted negative numbers first, followed by sorted non-negative numbers.

This approach ensures the function handles all the examples provided, even though the docstring focuses on non-negative integers.

Here's the complete, executable Python code:

    negatives_sorted = sorted(negatives)
    
    # Sort non-negatives by (number of ones in binary, then the number itself)
    non_negatives_sorted = sorted(non_negatives, key=lambda x: (bin(x).count('1'), x))
    
    # Combine and return the result
    return negatives_sorted + non_negatives_sorted

# Example usage as per your prompt
print(sort_array([1, 5, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: [1, 2, 4, 3, 5] (based on the sorting logic)
print(sort_array([-2, -3, -4, -5, -6]))  # Output: [-6, -5, -4, -3, -2]
print(sort_array([1, 0, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: [0, 1, 2, 4, 3]
```

### Explanation:
- **Separation**: We split the array into two lists for easier handling.
- **Sorting Negatives**: `sorted(negatives)` sorts them in ascending order, e.g., [-6, -5, -4, -3, -2].
- **Sorting Non-Negatives**: We use a key function in `sorted()`:
  - `bin(x).count('1')` counts the number of '1's in the binary representation of `x`.
  - The key tuple `(bin(x).count('1'), x)` ensures primary sorting by the count of ones, and secondary sorting by the value of `x`.
- **Combination**: We concatenate the sorted lists, so negatives come first.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - Zero (0) is treated as non-negative, and its binary representation ('0b0') has 0 ones.
  - The function assumes the input is a list of integers, as per the examples.

Note: The output for the first and third examples in your prompt doesn't exactly match the described sorting logic (e.g., [1, 2, 4, 3, 5] instead of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]).

            return False
        i += 6  # Check numbers of the form 6k ± 1
    
    return True
```

### Explanation:
- **Edge cases**: The function first handles numbers less than or equal to 1 as not prime. It also directly checks for 2 and 3 as primes.
- **Efficiency**: It skips even numbers after 2 and multiples of 3, then checks potential factors up to the square root of n (using a loop that increments by 6 to test numbers of the form 6k ± 1, which covers all primes greater than 3).
- **Testing**: You can run the function with the examples in the docstring to verify it works as expected. For instance:

# Example usage:

### Explanation:

### Explanation:
- **Import**: I imported `hashlib` at the top, as it's good practice for clean and executable code.
- **Empty String Check**: The function first checks if `text` is an empty string (`""""`) and returns `None` if true.
- **MD5 Computation**: For non-empty strings, it encodes the string to bytes (using UTF-8 encoding) and computes the MD5 hash using `hashlib.md5`. The result is converted to a hexadecimal string with `hexdigest()`.

    # Convert the rounded value to a binary string prefixed with ""0b""
    binary_representation = bin(int(rounded_value))  # bin() requires an integer
    
    return binary_representation
```

### Explanation:
- **Input Validation**: The function first checks if `n > m`. If true, it immediately returns `-1`.
- **Average Calculation**: The average of the numbers from `n` to `m` is simply `(n + m) / 2`, as this is an arithmetic series.
- **Rounding**: The `round()` function is used, which rounds to the nearest integer. For ties (e.g., 26.5), Python's `round()` uses banker's rounding (rounds to the nearest even integer).
- **Binary Conversion**: The `bin()` function converts the rounded integer to a binary string, prefixed with ""0b"".
- **Edge Cases**: The docstring specifies that `n` and `m` are positive integers, so no additional checks for negativity or non-integer inputs are included.

### Example Usage:
You can test the function in a Python environment like this:

### Explanation:
- **Function Implementation**:
  - I added a check to ensure the input is a string, raising an error if it's not, to make the function more robust.
  - I used a set for quick lookups of standard vowels.
  - The loop iterates through the string and counts only the standard vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' in any case).
  - After the loop, I separately check if the string ends with 'y' or 'Y' and increment the count if it does.
  
- **Added Test Cases**:
  - I included 10 additional examples in the docstring to cover a variety of scenarios, such as:
    - Empty strings.
    - Strings with all vowels.
    - Strings ending with 'y' or 'Y'.
    - Strings where 'y' is not at the end.
    - Uppercase, lowercase, and mixed-case strings.
    - Single-character strings.
    - Strings with no vowels.

humaneval,HumanEval/52,Cascade,1,"Here's the complete implementation of the `below_threshold` function in Python. I've added the function body based on the description in the docstring. The function checks if all elements in the list `l` are strictly less than the threshold `t`.

```python
def below_threshold(l: list, t: int):
    """"""Return True if all numbers in the list l are below threshold t.
    >>> below_threshold([1, 2, 4, 10], 100)

    False
    """"""
    # Use the all() function to check if every element in l is less than t

### Explanation:
- This implementation uses a generator expression inside the `all()` function, which is a concise and efficient way to verify that every element in the list satisfies the condition.
- If the list is empty, `all()` will return `True`, as there are no elements that fail the condition.
- The function assumes that the list contains numbers (e.g., integers or floats). If the list might contain non-numeric values, additional error handling would be needed.

You can test this function in a Python environment. For example:
```python

        - the next even number if n is even.
    Return the number of stones in each level in a list, where element at index

                odd_count += 1
    
    return (even_count, odd_count)  # Return the tuple of counts
```

### Explanation:
- **Input Handling**: The function works with positive, negative, or zero values. It converts the number to a string to access individual digits.
- **Digit Checking**: Only digits (0-9) are processed using `char.isdigit()`, which automatically skips the negative sign if present.
- **Even/Odd Logic**: A digit is even if it's divisible by 2 (i.e., `digit % 2 == 0`). Zero is considered even.
- **Output**: The function returns a tuple `(even_count, odd_count)`.

### Examples:
- `even_odd_count(-12)`: Digits are '1' (odd) and '2' (even) → Returns `(1, 1)`
- `even_odd_count(123)`: Digits are '1' (odd), '2' (even), '3' (odd) → Returns `(1, 2)`
- `even_odd_count(0)`: Digit is '0' (even) → Returns `(1, 0)`
- `even_odd_count(246)`: Digits are '2' (even), '4' (even), '6' (even) → Returns `(3, 0)`

### Explanation:
- **Import**: We import the `math` module to use `math.ceil`, which rounds a number up to the nearest integer.
- **Loop through the list**: For each number in the input list, we first apply `math.ceil` to get the ceiling value, convert it to an integer (to ensure we're working with whole numbers), square it, and add it to a running total.
- **Edge cases handled**:
  - An empty list will return 0, as the total starts at 0 and no iterations occur.
  - Negative numbers are handled correctly by `math.ceil` (e.g., ceiling of -2.4 is -2).
- **Output**: The function returns an integer, matching the examples provided.

humaneval,HumanEval/93,Cascade,1,"Here's the implementation of the `encode` function based on the specifications in your query. The function processes each character in the message as follows:

- First, swap the case of the character (uppercase to lowercase and vice versa).
- Then, if the swapped character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, or their uppercase versions), replace it with the letter that is 2 positions ahead in the English alphabet, preserving the case of the swapped character.
- Non-vowel characters (after swapping) remain unchanged.
- Spaces and other non-letter characters (though the prompt assumes only letters) are left as is.

The replacement wraps around the alphabet (e.g., 'y' + 2 becomes 'a', and 'Y' + 2 becomes 'A'), but since we're only dealing with vowels, this is unlikely to come up often.

Here's the clean, executable Python code:

```python

- **Line 1-2**: Define the set of vowels for easy checking.
- **Line 4**: Iterate through each character in the input message.
- **Line 5-6**: If the character is a letter, swap its case.
- **Line 7-16**: If the swapped character is a vowel:
  - Convert it to lowercase to calculate the new position.
  - Compute the new position by adding 2 and wrapping around the alphabet (using modulo 26).
  - Generate the new letter in lowercase, then adjust its case to match the original swapped character's case.
- **Line 17-19**: If it's not a vowel or not a letter, use the swapped character (or original if not a letter).
- **Line 21**: Join the list of characters into a string and return it.

        mid2 = sorted_l[n // 2]     # Second middle element
        return (mid1 + mid2) / 2    # Average of the two middle elements
```

### Explanation:
- **Sorting**: I use `sorted(l)` to create a sorted copy of the list, which works for any comparable elements (e.g., numbers).
- **Edge Case Handling**: I added a check for an empty list to raise an error, as calculating the median of an empty list doesn't make sense.
- **Odd Length**: For lists like `[3, 1, 2, 4, 5]` (length 5), it returns the middle element (index 2 in the sorted list: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`).
- **Even Length**: For lists like `[-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20]` (length 6), it averages the two middle elements (sorted: `[-10, 4, 6, 10, 20, 1000]`), so `(6 + 10) / 2 = 15.0`.
- **Output Type**: The function returns an integer for odd-length lists with integer elements and a float for even-length lists or when averaging results in a decimal.

humaneval,HumanEval/3,Cascade,1,"Here's the implementation of the `below_zero` function based on the provided docstring. I'll first explain the reasoning briefly, then provide the complete, executable code.

### Reasoning:
- The function needs to simulate a bank account starting with a balance of zero.
- Iterate through the list of operations, updating the balance by adding each operation value.
- After each operation, check if the balance is less than zero.
- If the balance goes below zero at any point, return `True` immediately.
- If the loop completes without the balance going below zero, return `False`.
- This approach handles all cases, including an empty list (balance stays at zero, so return `False`) and lists with mixed positive and negative values.

Now, here's the updated function:

```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """"""You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with
    zero balance. Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of account falls below zero, and

            return True  # Return True if balance falls below zero
    return False  # Return False if balance never goes below zero

This code is clean, efficient, and directly implements the required logic. You can test it with the provided examples or additional cases. For instance:

- `below_zero([])` should return `False` (empty list, balance stays at 0).
- `below_zero([-1])` should return `True` (balance goes to -1 immediately).",0.0005527,12.550551891326904,0,0,grok-3-mini,,

- **Non-decreasing check**: Uses `all()` with a generator to verify if every element is less than or equal to the next one.
- **Non-increasing check**: Similarly, verifies if every element is greater than or equal to the next one.
- **Return value**: The function returns `True` if either condition is met, otherwise `False`.

You can test this function in a Python environment. For example:
```python
print(monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20]))  # Output: True
print(monotonic([1, 20, 4, 10]))  # Output: False
print(monotonic([4, 1, 0, -10]))  # Output: True

humaneval,HumanEval/72,Cascade,1,"Here's the complete implementation of the `will_it_fly` function in Python. I've added the function body based on the description in the docstring. The function checks two conditions:

1. Whether the list `q` is a palindrome (i.e., it reads the same forwards and backwards).
2. Whether the sum of the elements in `q` is less than or equal to `w`.

If both conditions are met, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    '''
    Write a function that returns True if the object q will fly, and False otherwise.
    The object q will fly if it's balanced (it is a palindromic list) and the sum of its elements is less than or equal the maximum possible weight w.

    Example:
    will_it_fly([1, 2], 5) ➞ False 
    # 1+2 is less than the maximum possible weight, but it's unbalanced.

    will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1) ➞ False
    # it's balanced, but 3+2+3 is more than the maximum possible weight.

    will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9) ➞ True
    # 3+2+3 is less than the maximum possible weight, and it's balanced.

    will_it_fly([3], 5) ➞ True
    # 3 is less than the maximum possible weight, and it's balanced.
    '''
    
    # Check if q is a palindrome
    is_palindrome = q == q[::-1]
    
    # Check if the sum of elements in q is less than or equal to w
    total_sum = sum(q)
    is_weight_ok = total_sum <= w
    
    # Return True only if both conditions are met
    return is_palindrome and is_weight_ok
```

### Explanation:
- **Palindrome Check**: `q == q[::-1]` compares the original list with its reverse.
- **Sum Check**: `sum(q)` calculates the total sum of the elements in the list, and we compare it to `w`.
- **Combined Logic**: The function uses a logical AND to ensure both conditions are true before returning `True`.

You can test this function with the provided examples:
- `will_it_fly([1, 2], 5)` returns `False`.
- `will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1)` returns `False`.
- `will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9)` returns `True`.
- `will_it_fly([3], 5)` returns `True`.

humaneval,HumanEval/140,Cascade,1,"Below is the complete implementation of the `fix_spaces` function in Python. I've written clean, executable code based on the specifications in your prompt. The function processes the input string as follows:

- It iterates through the string character by character.
- Non-space characters are added to the result as-is.
- For sequences of spaces:
  - If there is 1 or 2 consecutive spaces, replace them with underscores (`_`).
  - If there are more than 2 consecutive spaces, replace the entire sequence with a single hyphen (`-`).

Here's the code:

```python
def fix_spaces(text):
    """"""
    Given a string text, replace all spaces in it with underscores, 
    and if a string has more than 2 consecutive spaces, 
    then replace all consecutive spaces with -

    fix_spaces(""Example 1"") == ""Example_1""
    fix_spaces("" Example 2"") == ""_Example_2""

    """"""
    result = []  # Use a list to build the result for efficiency
    i = 0
    while i < len(text):
        if text[i] != ' ':  # If the character is not a space
            result.append(text[i])  # Add it to the result

                result.append('_' * count)  # Replace with '_' for each space
    return ''.join(result)  # Join the list into a string and return
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Loop through the string**: The `while` loop processes each character.
- **Handle non-spaces**: If the character is not a space, it's added directly to the `result` list.
- **Handle spaces**: When a space is encountered, we count the consecutive spaces. Based on the count:
  - If `count <= 2`, add the appropriate number of underscores.
  - If `count > 2`, add a single hyphen.
- **Edge cases handled**:
  - Empty string: Returns an empty string.
  - All spaces: E.g., ""   "" becomes ""-"".
  - Leading, trailing, or multiple sequences of spaces: Processed correctly as per the rules.

### Example Outputs:
You can test this function in a Python environment. Here are the expected results based on your examples:
- `fix_spaces(""Example"")` → `""Example""`
- `fix_spaces(""Example 1"")` → `""Example_1""`
- `fix_spaces("" Example 2"")` → `""_Example_2""`
- `fix_spaces("" Example   3"")` → `""_Example-3""`

humaneval,HumanEval/130,Cascade,1,"It looks like you're providing a description of a function `tri(n)` that computes a custom Tribonacci sequence and returns a list of the first `n + 1` numbers in the sequence (from `tri(0)` to `tri(n)`). However, the code snippet you provided is incomplete and seems to be a description rather than a working implementation.

Based on the rules you outlined:
- `tri(1) = 3`
- For even `n`, `tri(n) = 1 + n / 2` (using integer division for integer results)

### Explanation:
- **Array Initialization**: We use an array of size `n + 2` to store values up to `tri(n+1)` if needed for dependencies.
- **Even Values**: These are computed directly using the formula `1 + k // 2`.
- **Special Case for 1**: `tri(1)` is set to 3 as per the definition.

humaneval,HumanEval/137,Cascade,1,"Below is the implementation of the `compare_one` function based on the provided description. I'll first explain the approach briefly, then provide the complete, executable code.

### Explanation:
- **Input Handling**: The function accepts two arguments, `a` and `b`, which can be integers, floats, or strings representing real numbers. Strings may use either '.' or ',' as the decimal separator.
- **Conversion for Comparison**: To compare the values numerically, I convert them to floats. For strings, I replace ',' with '.' before conversion. This ensures accurate comparison while preserving the original input for the return value.
- **Comparison Logic**:
  - Convert both inputs to floats for numerical comparison.
  - If the numerical value of `a` is greater than `b`, return the original `a`.
  - If the numerical value of `b` is greater than `a`, return the original `b`.
  - If the values are equal (within floating-point precision), return `None`.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function assumes inputs are valid numbers or strings representing numbers, as per the problem description.
  - Floating-point comparisons may have minor precision issues, but this is acceptable for the given examples.
- **Return Type**: The function returns the larger value in its original type (e.g., if the larger value was a string, it returns the string as-is).

### Explanation:
- **Integer Check**: The condition `x == int(x)` and similar checks ensure that each number has no fractional part. For example:
  - `3 == int(3)` is `True` (it's an integer).
  - `3.0 == int(3.0)` is `True` (it's effectively an integer value).
  - `3.6 == int(3.6)` is `False` (it has a fractional part).
- **Sum Check**: We then verify if any one of the numbers equals the sum of the other two.
- **Edge Cases**: This handles negative numbers (as in the example with `-2`) and ensures the function returns `False` if any input is not an integer.

From the scenario described:
- There are `n` cars moving left to right and `n` cars moving right to left.
- All cars move at the same speed and start far apart.
- A collision occurs when any left-to-right car meets any right-to-left car.
- Since the cars pass through each other, every left-to-right car will collide with every right-to-left car exactly once.

This results in a total of `n * n` (or `n^2`) collisions, as each of the `n` left-to-right cars will collide with each of the `n` right-to-left cars.

    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.

    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

### Explanation:
- **Input Validation**: I added a simple check to ensure `n` is non-negative, as negative values don't make sense in this context.
- **Logic**: The function computes `n * n` to represent the total number of collisions.
- **Edge Cases**:

    # - Then by column index (descending) for the same row
    sorted_coordinates = sorted(coordinates, key=lambda coord: (coord[0], -coord[1]))
    
    return sorted_coordinates
```

### Explanation:
- **Iteration**: We use nested loops to go through each row and column. For each element that matches `x`, we add a tuple `(row_index, col_index)` to the `coordinates` list.
- **Sorting**: The `sorted()` function uses a key lambda function. It sorts primarily by the row index (`coord[0]`) in ascending order. For ties (same row), it sorts by the negative of the column index (`-coord[1]`), which effectively sorts columns in descending order.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - If `lst` is empty, the loop won't run, and an empty list is returned.
  - If a row is empty or `x` is not found, no tuples are added, resulting in an empty list.
  - Rows can have different lengths, which is handled naturally by the inner loop.

You can copy and paste this code into a Python environment to test it. For example:

I've added the function body to iterate from `n-1` down to 1 and return the first number that divides `n` evenly (i.e., with no remainder). This ensures we find the largest such divisor.

```python

    # For n <= 1, no divisors smaller than n exist, so return 1 as a fallback (though the problem assumes n > 1)
    return 1
```

### Explanation:
- **Loop**: We start from `n-1` and go downwards to 1, checking each number to see if it divides `n` evenly.
- **Condition**: If `n % i == 0`, then `i` is a divisor, and since we're going from largest to smallest, the first one we find is the largest.
- **Edge Case Handling**: If `n <= 1`, the loop won't run (as the range will be empty), and we've added a fallback return of 1. However, based on the problem description, `n` is assumed to be greater than 1.

You can test this function in a Python environment. For example:
- `largest_divisor(15)` returns `5`
- `largest_divisor(10)` returns `5`

humaneval,HumanEval/95,Cascade,1,"Below is the implementation of the `check_dict_case` function in Python. I've written clean, executable code based on the specifications provided in the prompt. The function checks the following:

- If the dictionary is empty, it returns `False`.
- If any key is not a string, it returns `False`.
- If all keys are strings, it checks whether all keys are in lowercase (using `str.islower()`) or all keys are in uppercase (using `str.isupper()`). If either condition is met, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Here's the code:

```python
def check_dict_case(d):
    # Step 1: Check if the dictionary is empty
    if not d:
        return False
    
    # Step 2: Get the keys and check if all are strings

    if not all(isinstance(key, str) for key in keys):

    # Step 3: Check if all keys are lowercase or all keys are uppercase
    all_lower = all(key.islower() for key in keys)
    all_upper = all(key.isupper() for key in keys)
    
    return all_lower or all_upper  # Return True if either condition is met

# Example usage:

print(check_dict_case({""STATE"": ""NC"", ""ZIP"": ""12345""}))  # Output: True
print(check_dict_case({}))  # Output: False  (empty dictionary)
```

### Explanation:
- **Line 1-2**: Check if the dictionary `d` is empty using `if not d:`. If it is, return `False`.
- **Line 4-6**: Extract the keys and verify if all are strings using a generator expression with `all()` and `isinstance()`. If any key is not a string, return `False`.
- **Line 8-10**: Use `all()` with `str.islower()` to check if all keys are lowercase, and `str.isupper()` to check if all keys are uppercase.
- **Line 12**: Return `True` if either all keys are lowercase or all keys are uppercase; otherwise, return `False`.

humaneval,HumanEval/71,Cascade,1,"It looks like you're providing a function signature and docstring for `triangle_area`, but the implementation is missing. I'll complete the function based on the description in the docstring. We'll use Heron's formula to calculate the area of a valid triangle.

Here's the complete, executable code:

```python
import math

def triangle_area(a, b, c):
    '''
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return the area of
    the triangle rounded to 2 decimal points if the three sides form a valid triangle. 
    Otherwise return -1
    Three sides make a valid triangle when the sum of any two sides is greater 
    than the third side.
    Example:
    triangle_area(3, 4, 5) == 6.00
    triangle_area(1, 2, 10) == -1
    '''
    # Check if the sides form a valid triangle
    if a + b > c and a + c > b and b + c > a:
        # Calculate the semi-perimeter
        s = (a + b + c) / 2
        # Calculate the area using Heron's formula
        area = math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))
        # Round the area to 2 decimal places
        return round(area, 2)
    else:
        return -1
```

### Explanation:
- **Validity Check**: The function first verifies if the sides satisfy the triangle inequality theorem (the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side).
- **Heron's Formula**: If the sides are valid, it computes the semi-perimeter `s` and then the area using the formula: \(\text{area} = \sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)}\).
- **Rounding**: The area is rounded to 2 decimal places using `round(area, 2)`.
- **Edge Cases**: If the sides do not form a valid triangle (e.g., due to negative values, zero, or inequality violations), the function returns -1.

You can test this function in a Python environment. For example:
```python
print(triangle_area(3, 4, 5))  # Output: 6.0
print(triangle_area(1, 2, 10))  # Output: -1

        return []
    return [i * xs[i] for i in range(1, len(xs))]  # For each coefficient xs[i], multiply by i
```

### Explanation:
- The derivative of a polynomial with coefficients `[a0, a1, a2, ..., an]` is `[1*a1, 2*a2, ..., n*an]`.
- The code uses a list comprehension to generate the new list:
  - It iterates from index 1 to the end of the list.
  - For each index `i`, it multiplies the coefficient `xs[i]` by `i`.
- If the input list has 0 or 1 elements (e.g., `[]` or `[5]`), the derivative is an empty list, as there are no terms left after differentiation.

You can test this function directly in a Python environment. For example:
- `derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])` returns `[1, 4, 12, 20]`

    between_planets = planets[start:end]  # Slice the list to get planets in between
    return tuple(between_planets)  # Convert the list to a tuple
```

### Explanation:
- **Planet List**: I defined a list `planets` with the planets in order from the Sun.
- **Validation**: The function first checks if both `planet1` and `planet2` are in the `planets` list. If not, it returns an empty tuple `()`.
- **Indices**: It retrieves the indices of the two planets using `planets.index()`.
- **Between Logic**: It calculates the range of indices between the two planets (exclusive of the endpoints) and slices the list to get the planets in that range.
- **Return**: The result is converted to a tuple and returned, already sorted by proximity to the Sun due to the order of the `planets` list.

You can test this function with the provided examples:
- `bf(""Jupiter"", ""Neptune"")` returns `(""Saturn"", ""Uranus"")`
- `bf(""Earth"", ""Mercury"")` returns `(""Venus"",)`
- `bf(""Mercury"", ""Uranus"")` returns `(""Venus"", ""Earth"", ""Mars"", ""Jupiter"", ""Saturn"")`

### Explanation:
- **Stack Usage**: We use a list (`stack`) to keep track of opening brackets (""<""). For each ""<"", we add it to the stack. For each "">"", we try to remove an element from the stack (which represents matching an opening bracket).
- **Edge Cases**:
  - If we encounter a "">"" and the stack is empty, it means there's no matching ""<"", so we return `False`.
  - At the end, if the stack is not empty, it means there are unmatched ""<"" brackets, so we return `False`.

### Explanation:
- **Input Validation**: I added a check to ensure the strings are of the same length, as XOR operations require corresponding elements. If they're not, it raises a `ValueError`.
- **XOR Logic**: The function iterates through the strings using `zip`, converts each pair of characters to integers, performs the XOR operation (`^`), and converts the result back to a string.
- **Output**: The results are joined into a single string and returned.
- **Example**: I included a simple test in the `if __name__ == ""__main__""` block to demonstrate the function with your provided example.

### Explanation:
- **Helper Function (`get_sum_of_signed_digits`)**: This handles the logic for a single number. It extracts the digits from the absolute value of the number and, if the number is negative, negates the first digit.
- **Main Logic**: Iterates through the array, checks the sum of signed digits for each number, and increments a counter for those where the sum is greater than 0.
- **Edge Cases Handled**:
  - Empty array (`arr = []`): Returns 0 immediately.
  - Zero (`n = 0`): Sum of digits is 0, so it doesn't count.
  - Positive numbers: Digits are summed as is.
  - Negative numbers: First digit is negated before summing.

### Explanation:
- **Imports**: I imported the `math` module to use `math.factorial`, which computes the factorial of a number.
- **Input Validation**: I added a simple check to ensure `n > 0`, as per the docstring. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, it raises a `ValueError`.
- **Loop**: The function iterates from 1 to `n`, multiplying the result by the factorial of each number in that range.
- **Edge Cases**: For small values like `n=1`, it returns `1! = 1`. For larger values, it works as expected, though be aware that results can grow extremely large and may cause performance issues for `n > 10` due to the rapid growth of factorials.

```python

    Given list of integers, return list in strange order.
    Strange sorting, is when you start with the minimum value,
    then maximum of the remaining integers, then minimum and so on.

    strange_sort_list([5, 5, 5, 5]) == [5, 5, 5, 5]
    strange_sort_list([]) == []
    '''
    if not lst:  # Handle empty list
        return []
    
    working_list = lst[:]  # Create a copy of the list to avoid modifying the original
    result = []  # List to store the strange sorted result
    take_min = True  # Start by taking the minimum
    
    while working_list:
        if take_min:

        take_min = not take_min  # Alternate between min and max
    
    return result
```

### Explanation:
- **Input Handling**: If the input list is empty, the function immediately returns an empty list.
- **Working Copy**: We use `lst[:]` to create a shallow copy of the list, ensuring the original list isn't modified.
- **Loop and Alternation**: The loop continues until the working list is empty. It alternates between finding the minimum (using `min()`) and maximum (using `max()`) of the current working list, adds the value to the result, and removes it from the working list.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - Lists with duplicates (e.g., `[5, 5, 5, 5]`) work correctly because `min()` and `max()` return the appropriate value, and `remove()` handles the first occurrence.
  - Single-element lists (e.g., `[1]`) will simply return `[1]`.
- **Time Complexity**: This implementation is O(n^2) in the worst case due to repeated calls to `min()` or `max()` and list removal, which is acceptable for small to medium-sized lists. If you need a more optimized version for large lists, let me know!

You can test this function directly in a Python environment. For example:

### Explanation:
- **is_prime function**: This is a helper function that efficiently checks if a number is prime using trial division up to the square root of the number, with optimizations to skip even numbers and multiples of 3.
- **prime_fib function**: 
  - It starts generating Fibonacci numbers from 0 and 1.
  - For each Fibonacci number greater than 1, it checks if it's prime.
  - It keeps a count of prime Fibonacci numbers and returns the n-th one.
- **Edge handling**: I've added a check to ensure `n` is positive, as per the examples provided.
- **Efficiency**: The code generates Fibonacci numbers on-the-fly and only performs primality checks when necessary, making it suitable for small to moderate values of `n`. For very large `n`, this might take time due to the nature of Fibonacci and prime checks.

    # Evaluate the expression using eval
    # Note: This is safe in this context as inputs are controlled (operators are predefined strings and operands are integers)

    return result

# Example usage:
# operator = ['+', '*', '-']
# operand = [2, 3, 4, 5]
# print(do_algebra(operator, operand))  # Output: 9
```

### Explanation:
- **Building the Expression**: We start with the first operand as a string and iteratively append each operator followed by the next operand. This creates a string like `'2+3*4-5'`.
- **Evaluation**: We use Python's `eval()` function to evaluate the string as a Python expression. This respects operator precedence (e.g., multiplication and exponentiation are handled before addition and subtraction).
- **Error Handling**: I've added a basic check to ensure the lists are of the correct lengths, as per the note in your description. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.
- **Safety Note**: While `eval()` is used here, it's generally recommended for controlled inputs only, as in this case (operators are limited to safe strings, and operands are non-negative integers).

- **First Condition**: We check if the number is greater than 10. Negative numbers and numbers ≤ 10 are skipped.
- **Digit Extraction**: For qualifying numbers, we convert the number to a string to easily access the first and last digits.
- **Second Condition**: We verify if both the first digit (`str_num[0]`) and the last digit (`str_num[-1]`) are odd by checking if they are in the string `'13579'`.
- **Edge Cases Handled**:
  - Empty array: The function will return 0 since no elements are processed.
  - Non-qualifying numbers: They are simply ignored.
- **Assumptions**: The input array contains integers, as implied by the examples. If floats are present, they might not behave as expected (e.g., due to decimal points), but the function will still run.

### Testing the Function:
You can test it with the provided examples:

```python
# Example 1
print(specialFilter([15, -73, 14, -15]))  # Output: 1

# Example 2
print(specialFilter([33, -2, -3, 45, 21, 109]))  # Output: 2

### Explanation:
- **is_prime function**: This is a helper function to determine if a number is prime. It's optimized to check divisibility up to the square root of the number.
- **Main function (skjkasdkd)**: 
  - It filters the list to get only prime numbers.
  - If primes exist, it finds the maximum one and sums its digits.
  - If no primes are found (e.g., an empty list or all non-prime numbers), it returns 0.
- **Edge cases handled**:
  - Empty list: Returns 0.
  - No primes: Returns 0.
  - Negative numbers: Treated as non-prime by `is_prime`.

### Explanation:
- **re.sub**: This function replaces each occurrence of a pattern in the string. The pattern `\S+` matches one or more non-space characters (i.e., words, including punctuation attached to them).
- **sort_word function**: This is a helper function that takes a match object from `re.sub`, sorts the characters of the matched word using `sorted()`, and joins them back into a string.

  - String with only spaces: Returns the same string.
  - String with no spaces: Treats the entire string as one word and sorts it.

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Loop through numbers**: We use a for loop to iterate from 1 to n.
- **Palindrome check**: Convert the number to a string and compare it to its reverse using `str_i[::-1]`.
- **Even/Odd check**: If the number is a palindrome, we use the modulo operator (`i % 2 == 0`) to determine if it's even or odd, and increment the appropriate counter.
- **Return value**: The function returns a tuple containing the count of even palindromes first, followed by the count of odd palindromes.

- **Check for n <= 1**: If `n` is 1 or less, it can't produce values greater than 1 through exponentiation in this context, so return `False`.
- **Loop to divide x by n**: Repeatedly divide `x` by `n` as long as `x > 1` and `x` is exactly divisible by `n`. If `x` reduces to 1, then `x` is a simple power of `n`.
- **Return result**: After the loop, check if `x` is 1.

### Verification with Examples:
- `is_simple_power(1, 4)`: x == 1, so returns True.
- `is_simple_power(2, 2)`: x=2 > 1, n=2 > 1, 2 % 2 == 0, x = 2 // 2 = 1, then returns True.
- `is_simple_power(8, 2)`: x=8 > 1, 8 % 2 == 0, x=4; 4 % 2 == 0, x=2; 2 % 2 == 0, x=1; returns True.
- `is_simple_power(3, 2)`: x=3 > 1, but 3 % 2 != 0, so returns False.
- `is_simple_power(3, 1)`: n=1 <= 1, so returns False.
- `is_simple_power(5, 3)`: x=5 > 1, 5 % 3 != 0, so returns False.

print(reverse_delete(""abcdedcba"", ""ab""))  # Output: ('cdedc', True)
```

### Explanation:
- **Line 1-2**: The function takes two strings, `s` and `c`, as inputs.
- **Line 5-6**: Convert `c` to a set for fast membership checking.
- **Line 9-13**: Iterate through each character in `s`. If the character is not in the set of characters to remove, add it to a list. This avoids inefficient string concatenation in a loop.
- **Line 15**: Join the list into a single string to get the final result.
- **Line 18**: Check if the resulting string is equal to its reverse (using slicing `result_string[::-1]`).
- **Line 20**: Return a tuple with the resulting string and the boolean result.
- **Example usage**: I've included test cases at the end to demonstrate how the function works.

                total_sum += element  # Add the odd element to the sum
    return total_sum  # Return the final sum
```

### Explanation:
- **Even positions**: We use 0-based indexing, so positions 0, 2, 4, etc., are even.
- **Odd elements**: An element is odd if it's not divisible by 2 (i.e., `element % 2 != 0`). This works for positive and negative integers.
- **Loop**: We use `enumerate(lst)` to get both the index and the element in each iteration.
- **Edge cases handled**:
  - The list is non-empty as per the prompt.
  - If there are no odd elements in even positions, the function returns 0.
  - Works with lists containing negative numbers, zeros, or a single element.

You can test this function in a Python environment. For example:

    sorted_items = sorted(items, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
    
    # Extract the original values from the sorted items
    return [item[2] for item in sorted_items]

# Example usage:
# print(order_by_points([1, 11, -1, -11, -12]))  # Output: [1, -1, 11, -11, -12]
# print(order_by_points([]))  # Output: []
```

### Explanation:
- **sum_of_digits function**: This calculates the sum of the digits of the absolute value of a number. For example:
  - For 1, the sum is 1.
  - For -11, the absolute value is 11, so the sum is 1 + 1 = 2.
- **order_by_points function**:
  - If the input list is empty, it returns an empty list.
  - It creates a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the sum of digits, the original index, and the number itself.
  - It sorts this list using the key `(sum_of_digits, original_index)`, ensuring that the sort is stable (Python's `sorted` is stable, so ties in sum_of_digits will maintain the original order based on index).
  - Finally, it extracts and returns the sorted numbers.

This implementation follows the description in the prompt. Note that the example output in the prompt might not match exactly due to the stable sort behavior, but the code adheres to the specified rules.

humaneval,HumanEval/32,Cascade,1,"It looks like you're providing a code snippet with an incomplete implementation for the `find_zero` function. The function is intended to find a root of the polynomial defined by the coefficients in `xs`, using the `poly` function you provided. Since the prompt involves code generation, I'll complete the implementation of `find_zero` based on the specifications in the docstring.

### Key Requirements from the Docstring:
- `xs` is a list of coefficients for a polynomial.
- The function should find an `x` such that `poly(xs, x) = 0`.
- It only handles lists with an even number of coefficients (e.g., 2, 4, etc.), and it's guaranteed to have at least one real root.
- Return only one zero point, even if there are multiple roots.
- Use numerical methods to approximate the root, as exact algebraic solutions aren't feasible for general polynomials.

I'll implement this using the bisection method, which is a reliable numerical approach for finding roots of continuous functions like polynomials. The bisection method requires:
- Finding an initial interval [a, b] where the function changes sign (i.e., f(a) and f(b) have opposite signs).
- Iteratively narrowing the interval until the root is approximated within a small tolerance.

Since the polynomials are of odd degree (even number of coefficients means degree = len(xs) - 1, which is odd), they are guaranteed to have at least one real root. I'll start by searching for an interval where the sign change occurs.

Here's the completed code:

```python

### Explanation:
- The function iterates through the first half of the array (up to `n // 2`).
- For each index `i`, it checks if `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[n - 1 - i]` (the corresponding element from the end).
- If they are not equal, it increments the `changes` counter by 1, as at least one element in that pair needs to be changed.
- The function returns the total count of mismatches, which represents the minimum changes required.

### Explanation:
- **Input Parsing**: The input string is a space-separated sequence of musical notes. We'll split the string into tokens using the `split()` method, which handles spaces automatically.
- **Mapping Notes to Beats**: Use a dictionary to map each note to its corresponding beat value based on the legend:
  - 'o' maps to 4 beats (whole note).
  - 'o|' maps to 2 beats (half note).
  - '.|' maps to 1 beat (quarter note).
- **Processing**: Iterate through the tokens and convert each one to its beat value using the dictionary. Collect these values into a list.
- **Output**: Return the list of integers representing the beats.
- **Assumptions**: The input string will only contain valid tokens as per the examples, so no error handling for invalid tokens is added.

humaneval,HumanEval/144,Cascade,1,"Here's the implementation of the `simplify` function based on the problem description. The function takes two strings, `x` and `n`, each representing a fraction in the format ""numerator/denominator"". It computes the product of the two fractions and checks if the result is a whole number (i.e., an integer).

```python
def simplify(x, n):
    # Split the strings to extract numerators and denominators
    num_x, den_x = x.split('/')
    num_n, den_n = n.split('/')
    
    # Convert strings to integers
    a = int(num_x)  # Numerator of x
    b = int(den_x)  # Denominator of x
    c = int(num_n)  # Numerator of n
    d = int(den_n)  # Denominator of n
    
    # Compute the numerator and denominator of the product
    product_numerator = a * c
    product_denominator = b * d
    
    # Check if the product is a whole number
    # This is true if product_numerator is divisible by product_denominator
    return (product_numerator % product_denominator) == 0
```

### Explanation:
- **Parsing the input**: We use `split('/')` to separate the numerator and denominator from each string.
- **Fraction multiplication**: For fractions \( \frac{a}{b} \) and \( \frac{c}{d} \), the product is \( \frac{a \times c}{b \times d} \).
- **Whole number check**: We verify if \( a \times c \) is exactly divisible by \( b \times d \) using the modulo operator (`%`). If the remainder is 0, the result is a whole number.
- **Edge cases**: As per the problem, both numerators and denominators are positive whole numbers, and denominators are never zero, so no additional validation is needed.

### Examples:
- `simplify(""1/5"", ""5/1"")`: Product is \( (1 \times 5) / (5 \times 1) = 5 / 5 = 1 \), which is a whole number, so it returns `True`.
- `simplify(""1/6"", ""2/1"")`: Product is \( (1 \times 2) / (6 \times 1) = 2 / 6 = 1/3 \), not a whole number, so it returns `False`.
- `simplify(""7/10"", ""10/2"")`: Product is \( (7 \times 10) / (10 \times 2) = 70 / 20 = 3.5 \), not a whole number, so it returns `False`.

humaneval,HumanEval/69,Cascade,1,"Below is the implementation of the `search` function in Python. I've written clean, executable code based on the problem description. The function uses a dictionary to count the frequencies of each integer in the list, then checks the condition for each unique integer, and finally returns the greatest integer that satisfies the criteria or -1 if none do.

```python
from collections import Counter

def search(lst):
    '''
    You are given a non-empty list of positive integers. Return the greatest integer that is greater than 
    zero, and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself. 
    The frequency of an integer is the number of times it appears in the list.
    If no such a value exist, return -1.
    Examples:
        search([4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]) == 2
        search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) == 3
        search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]) == -1
    '''
    # Step 1: Count the frequency of each element in the list
    frequency = Counter(lst)
    
    # Step 2: Check each unique element
    candidates = []
    for num in frequency:  # Iterate through the unique numbers
        if frequency[num] >= num:  # Frequency must be >= the number itself
            candidates.append(num)  # Add to candidates if condition is met
    
    # Step 3: Return the maximum candidate or -1 if none exist
    if candidates:
        return max(candidates)
    else:
        return -1
```

### Explanation:
- **Line 1:** Import `Counter` from the `collections` module to easily count frequencies.
- **Step 1:** Use `Counter(lst)` to create a dictionary-like object where keys are the unique elements from the list, and values are their frequencies.
- **Step 2:** Iterate through each unique number in the frequency counter. For each number, check if its frequency is greater than or equal to the number itself. If it is, add the number to the `candidates` list.
- **Step 3:** After checking all numbers, if the `candidates` list is not empty, return the maximum value from it. Otherwise, return -1.

This code is efficient, with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the list, due to the frequency counting and a single pass through the unique elements.

You can test it with the provided examples:
- `search([4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1])` should return `2`.

            a, b, c = b, c, next_value  # Shift the values for the next iteration
        return c  # c will hold the value of fibfib(n)

### Explanation:
- **Base cases**: Directly return the values for n = 0, 1, or 2 as per the definition.
- **Iterative computation**: For n > 2, we loop from 3 to n, calculating each subsequent value using the formula. We only maintain the last three values (a, b, c), which makes this approach memory-efficient.
- **Time complexity**: O(n), as we perform a single loop up to n.
- **Space complexity**: O(1), since we use a fixed amount of extra space.

humaneval,HumanEval/125,Cascade,1,"Below is the implementation of the `split_words` function in Python, based on the specifications in the query. I'll first explain the approach briefly, then provide the code.

### Explanation:
- **Step 1:** Check if the string contains any whitespace characters (e.g., spaces, tabs). If it does, split the string on whitespace and return the resulting list of words. Python's `str.split()` method is used for this, as it handles whitespace appropriately and ignores consecutive spaces.
- **Step 2:** If no whitespace is found, check if the string contains any commas. If it does, split the string on commas and return the resulting list.
- **Step 3:** If neither whitespace nor commas are present, iterate through the string. For each lowercase letter (a-z), calculate its order in the alphabet (e.g., 'a' = 0, 'b' = 1, etc.). Count how many of these orders are odd (e.g., 1, 3, 5, etc.) and return that count.
- **Edge cases handled:**
  - Strings with no lowercase letters will return 0.
  - Non-lowercase characters (e.g., uppercase, numbers, punctuation) are ignored in the counting step.
  - The function preserves punctuation in the split results, as shown in the examples.

Here's the clean, executable code:

```python
def split_words(txt):
    # Step 1: Check if there are any whitespace characters
    if any(char.isspace() for char in txt):
        return txt.split()  # Split on whitespace and return the list
    
    # Step 2: Check if there are any commas
    elif ',' in txt:
        return txt.split(',')  # Split on commas and return the list
    
    # Step 3: No whitespace or commas, so count lowercase letters with odd order
    count = 0
    for char in txt:
        if char.islower():  # Only consider lowercase letters
            order = ord(char) - ord('a')  # Calculate order: 'a' = 0, 'b' = 1, etc.
            if order % 2 == 1:  # Check if the order is odd
                count += 1
    return count

# Example usage:
print(split_words(""Hello world!""))  # Output: ['Hello', 'world!']
print(split_words(""Hello,world!""))  # Output: ['Hello', 'world!']
print(split_words(""abcdef""))       # Output: 3

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:

            result.append(string)  # Add the string to the result list if it matches
    return result  # Return the filtered list
```

### Explanation:
- **Logic**: The function iterates over the input list `strings` and uses the `startswith()` method to check if each string begins with the `prefix`. Matching strings are added to a new list called `result`.
- **Edge Cases**: 
  - If `strings` is empty (e.g., `[]`), the function returns an empty list, as shown in the docstring.
  - If `prefix` is an empty string, `startswith('')` will return `True` for every string, so the function will return the entire input list.
- **Usage**: You can test this function in a Python environment. For example:
  ```python
  print(filter_by_prefix(['apple', 'banana', 'apricot', 'cherry'], 'ap'))  # Output: ['apple', 'apricot']

    # Compute the cube root, round to the nearest integer, and check if cubing it equals a
    cube_root = round(a ** (1/3))  # a ** (1/3) gives the floating-point cube root
    return cube_root ** 3 == a
```

### Explanation:
- The function first handles the special case where `a` is 0, as it is a perfect cube (0^3 = 0).
- For other values, it calculates the cube root using `a ** (1/3)`, rounds it to the nearest integer with `round()`, and then checks if cubing this integer equals the original `a`.
- This approach works for positive, negative, and zero values, as demonstrated by the examples.

You can test this function directly in a Python environment. For instance:

2. No number in the list can appear more than twice (i.e., if any number has more than one duplicate, the function returns `False`).

Here's the code:

```python

        count = 1  # Start count for the current element
        j = i + 1
        
        # Count consecutive occurrences of the current element
        while j < len(lst) and lst[j] == current:
            count += 1
            j += 1

            return False
        
        i = j  # Move to the next group
    
    return True  # All checks passed
```

### Explanation:
- **Edge Cases**: If the list is empty or has only one element, it returns `True` immediately, as these are trivially sorted.
- **Main Logic**:
  - Iterate through the list and group consecutive identical elements.
  - For each group, check if the count of elements exceeds 2 (which would mean more than one duplicate).
  - Also, ensure that the next element (if it exists) is greater than or equal to the current group's element to maintain ascending order.
- **Time Complexity**: The function processes the list in a single pass, resulting in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the list.

### Verification with Examples:
- `is_sorted([5])` → Returns `True` (single element).
- `is_sorted([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` → Returns `True` (sorted, no duplicates).
- `is_sorted([1, 3, 2, 4, 5])` → Returns `False` (not sorted).
- `is_sorted([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])` → Returns `True`.
- `is_sorted([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])` → Returns `True`.
- `is_sorted([1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7])` → Returns `False` (not sorted).
- `is_sorted([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4])` → Returns `True` (sorted, each duplicate appears exactly twice).
- `is_sorted([1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4])` → Returns `False` (sorted, but '2' has more than one duplicate).

### Explanation:
- **uppercase_vowels**: A set for quick lookup of uppercase vowels.
- **Loop**: We use `range(0, len(s), 2)` to only access even indices (starting from 0).
- **Condition**: For each character at an even index, we check if it's in the set of uppercase vowels.

    new_list = l.copy()
    index_for_sorted = 0  # Tracker for the sorted elements
    for i in range(len(l)):

            index_for_sorted += 1  # Move to the next sorted element
    
    return new_list
```

### Explanation:
- **Line 1-2**: Check if the input list is empty and return an empty list if so.
- **Line 5**: Extract elements from the original list where the index is divisible by 3 (e.g., 0, 3, 6, etc.).
- **Line 8**: Sort the extracted elements in ascending order.
- **Line 11-17**: Create a copy of the original list and iterate through it. For indices divisible by 3, replace the element with the next value from the sorted list.
- **Return**: The modified list is returned.

This code is efficient, handles edge cases (like empty lists or lists with fewer than 3 elements), and produces the expected output as per the examples. You can test it in a Python environment. For instance:

```python
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: [1, 2, 3]

humaneval,HumanEval/151,Cascade,1,"It looks like you're providing a function signature and docstring for `double_the_difference`, and you want me to implement the function body based on the description. I'll write a complete, clean, and executable Python function that matches the specified behavior.

Here's the implemented function:

```python
def double_the_difference(lst):
    '''
    Given a list of numbers, return the sum of squares of the numbers
    in the list that are odd. Ignore numbers that are negative or not integers.
    
    double_the_difference([1, 3, 2, 0]) == 1 + 9 + 0 + 0 = 10  # Explanation: 1^2 + 3^2 = 10
    double_the_difference([-1, -2, 0]) == 0
    double_the_difference([9, -2]) == 81  # 9^2 = 81
    double_the_difference([0]) == 0  
    
    If the input list is empty, return 0.
    '''
    total_sum = 0  # Initialize the sum to 0
    for num in lst:
        # Check if the number is an integer, non-negative, and odd
        if isinstance(num, int) and num >= 0 and num % 2 != 0:
            total_sum += num ** 2  # Add the square of the number to the sum
    return total_sum
```

### Explanation:
- **Logic Breakdown**:
  - We iterate through each element in the input list `lst`.
  - For each element, we check three conditions:
    - `isinstance(num, int)`: Ensures the element is an integer (ignores floats, strings, etc.).
    - `num >= 0`: Ignores negative numbers as specified.
    - `num % 2 != 0`: Checks if the number is odd.
  - If all conditions are met, we square the number (`num ** 2`) and add it to `total_sum`.
  - After processing the entire list, we return `total_sum`. If the list is empty or no elements meet the criteria, it naturally returns 0.

### Example Usage:
You can test this function in a Python environment. Here's a quick demonstration:

```python
print(double_the_difference([1, 3, 2, 0]))  # Output: 10
print(double_the_difference([-1, -2, 0]))   # Output: 0
print(double_the_difference([9, -2]))       # Output: 81
print(double_the_difference([0]))           # Output: 0
print(double_the_difference([]))            # Output: 0
print(double_the_difference([1.5, 2, 3]))   # Output: 9 (only 3 is an odd positive integer)

humaneval,HumanEval/157,Cascade,1,"Here's the completed implementation of the `right_angle_triangle` function in Python. I've added the function body based on the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the longest side (hypotenuse) equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

To make it robust, I'll sort the sides to ensure we're checking the correct hypotenuse, regardless of the order of input.

```python
def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    '''
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three
    sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.
    A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or 
    90 degree.
    Example:
    right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
    right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False
    '''
    # Put the sides into a list and sort them
    sides = [a, b, c]
    sides.sort()  # Now sides[0] <= sides[1] <= sides[2]
    
    # Check if the Pythagorean theorem holds: sides[0]^2 + sides[1]^2 == sides[2]^2
    return (sides[0]**2 + sides[1]**2) == sides[2]**2
```

### Explanation:
- **Sorting the sides**: We sort the list to ensure the largest side (potential hypotenuse) is at the end.
- **Pythagorean check**: We verify if the sum of the squares of the two smaller sides equals the square of the largest side.
- **Edge cases handled**: This works for positive numbers. If the inputs are not valid (e.g., negative or zero), the function may still run but won't make mathematical sense, as per the problem's assumptions.

You can test it like this:
```python
print(right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5))  # Output: True
print(right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3))  # Output: False
print(right_angle_triangle(5, 12, 13))  # Output: True
print(right_angle_triangle(6, 8, 10))  # Output: True

humaneval,HumanEval/82,Cascade,1,"Here's the implementation of the `prime_length` function in Python. I've written it as a clean, executable code snippet. The function checks if the length of the input string is a prime number. To do this, I've included a helper function `is_prime` to determine if a number is prime.

```python
def is_prime(n):

    if n <= 1:
        return False  # Numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime

print(prime_length('kittens'))  # Output: True (length 7 is prime)

print(prime_length(''))         # Output: False (length 0 is not prime)
print(prime_length('a'))        # Output: False (length 1 is not prime)
```

### Explanation:
- **is_prime function**: This checks if a given number `n` is prime. It returns `False` for numbers less than or equal to 1 and checks for divisors from 2 up to the square root of `n` for efficiency.
- **prime_length function**: It simply gets the length of the input string and uses the `is_prime` helper to determine if that length is prime.
- **Edge cases handled**: Empty strings (length 0) and single-character strings (length 1) correctly return `False` since 0 and 1 are not prime.

humaneval,HumanEval/154,Cascade,1,"Below is the implementation of the `cycpattern_check` function in Python. This function checks if the second string (`b`) or any of its rotations is a substring of the first string (`a`). I'll first explain the approach briefly, then provide the code.

### Explanation:
- A rotation of a string `b` is created by shifting its characters circularly. For example, if `b` is ""abc"", its rotations are ""abc"", ""bca"", and ""cab"".
- We generate all possible rotations of `b`.
- For each rotation, we check if it is a substring of `a` (i.e., it appears contiguously within `a`).
- If any rotation (or `b` itself) is a substring of `a`, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
- Edge cases:
  - If `b` is an empty string, it is considered a substring of any string (as per standard string rules), so we return `True`.
  - If `a` is empty and `b` is not, no substring check will succeed, so it will return `False`.

This implementation is efficient for typical string lengths, as it generates and checks all rotations in O(n^2) time complexity, where n is the length of `b`.

### Code:
```python
def cycpattern_check(a, b):
    """"""

                total += lst[i]  # Add the even element to the total
    return total  # Return the final sum

### Explanation:
- **Odd indices**: In Python, indices start at 0 (even), so odd indices are 1, 3, 5, etc.
- **Even elements**: We only add elements that are even (i.e., divisible by 2 with no remainder).
- **Example walkthrough**:

### Explanation:
- **Functionality**: The function iterates through the input list `l` and includes only the elements that are greater than 0 in the output list.
- **Edge Cases Handled**:
  - If the input list is empty, it returns an empty list.
  - If the list contains no positive numbers (e.g., all negatives or zeros), it returns an empty list.
  - Zeros are excluded, as they are not considered positive.

            max_index = i  # Update to the current index (will be the largest at the end)
    
    return max_index
```

### Explanation:
- **Input Handling**: The function first checks if the array has 0 or 1 elements, in which case it returns -1 since there's no preceding element to compare.
- **Iteration**: It loops through the array from index 1 to the end, comparing each element with the one before it.
- **Condition Check**: If `arr[i] < arr[i-1]`, it updates `max_index` to the current index `i`. This ensures that `max_index` always holds the largest such index by the end of the loop.
- **Output**: After the loop, `max_index` is returned, which will be -1 if no violations were found.

This code is efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array, as it only requires a single pass through the array. You can test it directly in a Python environment. For example:

```

### Explanation:
- **Loop through the first k elements**: We use `range(k)` to access only the first `k` elements of the array.
- **Check for at most two digits**: For each element, we take its absolute value using `abs(num)`, convert it to a string, and check if the length of that string is 2 or less (e.g., 0 to 99, including single-digit numbers).
- **Add to sum**: If the condition is met, we add the original number (which could be positive or negative) to `total_sum`.
- **Edge cases handled**:
  - Single-element array: Works as expected.
  - All elements with more than two digits: Returns 0.
  - Negative numbers: Their absolute digit count is checked, but the original value is added (e.g., -5 has one digit, so it's included as -5).
  - Zero: Treated as having one digit, so it's included.

This code is efficient, straightforward, and adheres to the constraints. You can test it with the example:

```python

    # Find the common elements
    common_elements = set1.intersection(set2)
    
    # Sort the common elements and return as a list
    return sorted(common_elements)
```

### Explanation:
- **Step 1:** Convert both lists to sets (`set1` and `set2`) to automatically handle duplicates and prepare for finding common elements.
- **Step 2:** Use the `intersection` method to get the unique elements that are present in both sets.
- **Step 3:** Sort the resulting set using the `sorted` function, which returns a sorted list.
- **Edge Cases Handled:**
  - If either list is empty, the intersection will be empty, resulting in an empty list.
  - If there are no common elements, an empty list is returned.
  - The function assumes elements are hashable (e.g., numbers, strings) for set operations.

You can test this function directly in a Python environment. For example:
```python

I've added the function body to flip the case of each character in the input string: uppercase characters are converted to lowercase, lowercase characters are converted to uppercase, and non-alphabetic characters (like spaces, numbers, or punctuation) are left unchanged.

```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:

humaneval,HumanEval/149,Cascade,1,"It looks like you're providing a function definition with a docstring that describes the requirements, but the function body is missing. I'll write the complete, executable Python function based on the description in the docstring and the examples provided.

To summarize the requirements from the prompt:
- The function takes a list of strings as input.
- It should remove strings with odd lengths.
- The remaining strings should be sorted:
  - First, by ascending length.
  - If lengths are equal, sort alphabetically (ascending order).
- The docstring mentions ""You may assume that all words will have the same length,"" but this seems inconsistent with the examples (e.g., [""aa"", ""a"", ""aaa""] has strings of different lengths). I'll ignore that assumption and follow the filtering and sorting rules based on the examples.
- The function should return a new list of strings in the specified sorted order.
- The function name is `sorted_list_sum`, as per your code snippet.

Here's the complete, clean, and executable code:

```python
def sorted_list_sum(lst):
    """"""
    Accepts a list of strings, removes strings with odd lengths,
    and returns the resulting list sorted by:

    Examples:
    >>> sorted_list_sum([""aa"", ""a"", ""aaa""])
    ['aa']
    >>> sorted_list_sum([""ab"", ""a"", ""aaa"", ""cd""])
    ['ab', 'cd']

    filtered = [item for item in lst if len(item) % 2 == 0]
    
    # Step 2: Sort the filtered list
    # Use a key that first considers the length, then the string itself
    sorted_list = sorted(filtered, key=lambda x: (len(x), x))
    
    return sorted_list

# Example usage:
if __name__ == ""__main__"":

    print(sorted_list_sum([""ab"", ""a"", ""aaa"", ""cd""]))  # Output: ['ab', 'cd']
```

### Explanation:
- **Filtering**: I used a list comprehension to create a new list (`filtered`) that includes only strings where the length is even (i.e., `len(item) % 2 == 0`).
- **Sorting**: The `sorted()` function is used with a lambda key function. The key is a tuple `(len(x), x)`, which means:
  - It first sorts by the length of the string (`len(x)`) in ascending order.
  - If lengths are equal, it sorts by the string itself (`x`) alphabetically.
- **Edge Cases Handled**:
  - If the input list is empty, the function returns an empty list.
  - If all strings have odd lengths, the function returns an empty list.
  - Duplicates are preserved as per the prompt (e.g., if the input has [""aa"", ""aa""], both will remain if they pass filtering and will be sorted appropriately).

The function iterates from the right side of the string (starting from the second-to-last index) and checks for the rightmost vowel that is sandwiched between two consonants. If no such vowel is found, it returns an empty string.

```python
def get_closest_vowel(word):
    if len(word) < 3:
        return """"  # No vowel can be between two consonants in a string shorter than 3 characters
    
    vowels = set('aeiouAEIOU')  # Set of vowels for fast lookup

        if word[i] in vowels and word[i-1] not in vowels and word[i+1] not in vowels:
            # word[i] is a vowel, and both neighbors are consonants
            return word[i]
    
    return """"  # No qualifying vowel found
```

### Explanation:
- **Vowels Check**: We use a set `vowels` containing 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U' for case-sensitive matching.
- **Iteration**: We loop from `len(word) - 2` down to 1 to avoid checking the first or last character directly.
- **Conditions**:
  - `word[i] in vowels`: Checks if the current character is a vowel.
  - `word[i-1] not in vowels`: Ensures the character before it is a consonant.
  - `word[i+1] not in vowels`: Ensures the character after it is a consonant.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - Strings shorter than 3 characters immediately return an empty string.
  - If no vowel meets the criteria, the function returns an empty string after the loop.

### Example Outputs:
- `get_closest_vowel(""yogurt"")` → `""u""`
- `get_closest_vowel(""FULL"")` → `""U""`
- `get_closest_vowel(""quick"")` → `""""`
- `get_closest_vowel(""ab"")` → `""""`

- First, check if the string contains any letters.
- If it doesn't, reverse the string.
- If it does, iterate through each character: reverse the case of letters (using `swapcase()`), and leave non-letters unchanged.

```python
def solve(s):
    # Check if the string contains any letters
    has_letters = any(char.isalpha() for char in s)
    
    if not has_letters:
        # If no letters, reverse the string

        # Process each character: swap case if it's a letter, otherwise keep it

        for char in s:
            if char.isalpha():
                result.append(char.swapcase())  # Reverse the case of letters
            else:
                result.append(char)  # Keep non-letters as is
        return ''.join(result)
```

### Explanation:
- **Line 1:** We use a generator expression with `any()` to check if any character in the string is a letter (using `str.isalpha()`).
- **Line 3-5:** If there are no letters, we reverse the string using slicing (`s[::-1]`).
- **Line 7-13:** Otherwise, we build a new string by iterating through each character:
  - If the character is a letter, we use `str.swapcase()` to reverse its case.
  - If it's not a letter, we add it unchanged.
- **Line 12:** Join the list of characters into a single string and return it.

### Verification with Examples:
- `solve(""1234"")`: No letters, so it returns `""4321""`.
- `solve(""ab"")`: Both are letters, so it returns `""AB""`.
- `solve(""#a@C"")`: `#` and `@` are unchanged; `a` becomes `A`; `C` becomes `c`, so it returns `""#A@c""`.

The function calculates the strength of each extension as described (CAP - SM), identifies the strongest one (or the first one in case of ties), and returns the result in the specified format.

```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):

    You will be given the name of a class (a string) and a list of extensions.
    The extensions are to be used to load additional classes to the class. The

    # Return the result in the required format
    return f""{class_name}.{strongest_extension}""
```

### Explanation:
- **Strength Calculation**: For each extension, I use Python's string methods (`isupper()` and `islower()`) to count the number of uppercase (CAP) and lowercase (SM) letters, then compute the strength as CAP - SM.
- **Finding the Strongest Extension**: I iterate through the list and track the maximum strength. If a new extension has a higher strength than the current maximum, I update the maximum and record that extension. If strengths are equal, I do nothing, ensuring the first occurrence is kept.
- **Edge Case Handling**: If the `extensions` list is empty, the function raises a `ValueError` to make it robust.
- **Output Format**: The function returns a string in the format `""ClassName.StrongestExtensionName""`.

### Example Usage:
1. **Example 1:**
   ```python
   result = Strongest_Extension('Slices', ['SErviNGSliCes', 'Cheese', 'StuFfed'])

    odd_numbers.append(1)  # Always add 1 at the end since it's odd and the sequence ends there
    return sorted(odd_numbers)  # Return the sorted list

### Explanation:
- **Loop through the sequence**: We start with `current = n` and continue until `current` reaches 1.
- **Collect odd numbers**: Inside the loop, if the current number is odd, we add it to the `odd_numbers` list.
- **Generate the next number**: Apply the Collatz rule to update `current`.
- **Handle the end**: After the loop, add 1 to the list (since 1 is odd and part of the sequence).
- **Sort the result**: Finally, sort the list in increasing order using `sorted()`.

### Explanation:
- **Edge case handling**: If `x` is 0, the function returns '0' immediately.
- **Conversion logic**: The function uses a loop to repeatedly divide `x` by the base, collecting the remainders (which represent the digits in the new base). The remainders are stored in a list, reversed at the end, and then joined into a string.

### Explanation:
- **Vowels Handling**: The function checks for both lowercase and uppercase vowels.
- **Edge Cases**: It works for empty strings, strings with only vowels, strings with no vowels, and strings with special characters or newlines (e.g., ""\n"" is preserved).
- **Efficiency**: This implementation uses a simple loop, which is clear and efficient for most use cases. If you're working with very large strings, you could optimize it further using list comprehensions, but this is straightforward and executable as-is.

You can test this function in a Python environment. For example:
```python
print(remove_vowels(""Hello, World!""))  # Output: 'Hll, Wrld!'

humaneval,HumanEval/35,Cascade,1,"It looks like you're providing a function stub for `max_element` and want me to implement it based on the docstring. I'll complete the function to make it functional and executable. Here's the updated code:

    123
    """"""
    if not l:  # Handle empty list case to avoid errors
        raise ValueError(""The list is empty"")
    return max(l)
```

### Explanation:
- **Implementation**: I used Python's built-in `max()` function to find the maximum element, as it's clean, efficient, and directly matches the requirement.
- **Edge Case Handling**: I added a check for an empty list to raise a `ValueError`, which makes the function more robust. This isn't explicitly required in your docstring, but it's good practice.
- **Docstring**: I kept your original docstring intact for clarity and testing.

You can test this function in a Python environment. For example:
```python
print(max_element([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: 3
print(max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]))  # Output: 123

### Explanation:
- `s.replace(',', ' ')`: This replaces all commas in the string with spaces, allowing us to treat commas as separators.
- `s.split()`: This splits the string on whitespace (spaces, tabs, etc.) and automatically removes extra empty strings caused by consecutive spaces.
- The function returns a list of strings, as required.

        return candidate
    else:
        return -1  # No valid even number in the range
```

### Explanation:
- **Step 1:** Check if `x > y`. If true, return -1 immediately, as the range is empty or invalid.
- **Step 2:** Determine the largest even number less than or equal to `y`:
  - If `y` is even, use `y` as the candidate.
  - If `y` is odd, subtract 1 to get the next even number.
- **Step 3:** Verify if this candidate is greater than or equal to `x` and non-negative (to align with positive numbers).
- **Step 4:** If the candidate meets the criteria, return it; otherwise, return -1.

### Example Usage:
You can test this function in a Python environment. Here are the examples you provided:

- `choose_num(12, 15)`: Returns 14 (even numbers in range: 12, 14; largest is 14).
- `choose_num(13, 12)`: Returns -1 (x > y, so invalid range).

    # Apply the linear transformation: (x - min_val) / (max_val - min_val)
    return [(x - min_val) / (max_val - min_val) for x in numbers]
```

### Explanation:
- **Input Validation**: I added a check to ensure the list has at least two elements, as specified in the docstring, to make the function robust.
- **Edge Case Handling**: If all numbers in the list are identical (e.g., [2.0, 2.0]), this would result in division by zero. In such cases, the function returns a list of 0.0 for all elements, which is a reasonable default behavior.
- **Transformation Logic**: For each number `x` in the input list, the formula `(x - min_val) / (max_val - min_val)` is used to rescale it between 0 and 1.
- **Output**: The function returns a new list of floats, preserving the original order.

humaneval,HumanEval/142,Cascade,1,"Here's the complete implementation of the `sum_squares` function based on the description you provided. I'll first explain the code briefly and then provide the full, executable code.

### Explanation:
- We iterate through the list using `enumerate` to access both the index and the element.
- For each index:
  - If the index is a multiple of 3 (i.e., `i % 3 == 0`), we square the element.
  - If the index is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3 (i.e., `i % 4 == 0`), we cube the element.
  - Otherwise, we leave the element unchanged.
- After processing all elements, we compute and return the sum of the modified list.
- This handles the examples you provided:
  - For `[1, 2, 3]`, the modified list is `[1, 2, 3]` (index 0 is squared), and the sum is 6.
  - For `[]`, the sum is 0.
  - For `[-1, -5, 2, -1, -5]`, the modified list is `[1, -5, 2, 1, -125]`, and the sum is -126.

Here's the clean, executable Python code:

```python
def sum_squares(lst):
    """"""
    This function will take a list of integers. For all entries in the list, the function shall square the integer entry if its index is a 
    multiple of 3 and will cube the integer entry if its index is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3. The function will not 
    change the entries in the list whose indexes are not a multiple of 3 or 4. The function shall then return the sum of all entries. 
    
    Examples:
    For lst = [1,2,3] the output should be 6
    For lst = []  the output should be 0
    For lst = [-1,-5,2,-1,-5]  the output should be -126
    """"""
    for i, num in enumerate(lst):
        if i % 3 == 0:  # Index is a multiple of 3
            lst[i] = num ** 2  # Square the element
        elif i % 4 == 0:  # Index is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3
            lst[i] = num ** 3  # Cube the element

    sorted_words = sorted(words, key=lambda word: num_dict[word])
    
    # Join the sorted words back into a single string separated by spaces
    return ' '.join(sorted_words)
```

### Explanation:
- **Mapping Dictionary**: I created a dictionary `num_dict` to associate each word (e.g., 'one') with its numerical value (e.g., 1). This allows us to sort based on the actual numbers.
- **Splitting the String**: `numbers.split()` converts the input string into a list of words.
- **Sorting**: The `sorted()` function is used with a lambda key that looks up the numerical value from the dictionary. This ensures the words are sorted in ascending order based on their numerical equivalents.
- **Joining the Result**: The sorted list is joined back into a string using `' '.join(sorted_words)`.

This code is clean, executable, and handles the example provided in the docstring correctly. You can test it in a Python environment like this:

            if counter < 0:  # If counter goes negative, there's an unmatched closing bracket
                return False  # Return False immediately
    
    return counter == 0  # Return True only if the counter is zero (all brackets matched)
```

### Explanation:
- **Counter Mechanism**: We use a counter to simulate a stack. Increment it for each '(' and decrement for each ')'.
- **Edge Case Handling**: If the counter goes negative at any point, it means there's a ')' without a matching '(', so we return False.
- **Final Check**: After processing the string, the counter must be zero for the brackets to be correctly balanced.
- **Assumptions**: As per the docstring, the input string only contains '(' and ')', so no additional validation is needed.

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Digit counting**: We use a generator expression with `sum` to iterate through each character in `file_name` and count how many are digits using `char.isdigit()`.
- **Dot checking**: We use `file_name.count('.')` to ensure there's exactly one dot.
- **Splitting**: `file_name.split('.')` splits the string into two parts. We then validate each part.
- **Before dot validation**: Check if it's non-empty (`not before_dot`) and if the first character is an alphabet letter (`before_dot[0].isalpha()`).
- **After dot validation**: Compare it against the list of valid extensions.
- **Edge cases handled**: The function will return 'No' for invalid cases like multiple dots, empty before-dot, non-alphabet starting character, invalid extensions, or more than three digits.

### Example Usage:
You can test the function as follows:

```python
# Example 1
print(file_name_check(""example.txt""))  # Output: 'Yes'

# Example 2

### Explanation:
- `a % 10` computes the unit digit of `a`. For example:
  - If `a = 148`, then `148 % 10 = 8`.
  - If `a = -15`, then `-15 % 10 = 5` (Python handles negative numbers by returning a positive remainder).

    x_or_y(15, 8, 5) == 5   # 15 is not prime

        i += 6  # Increment by 6 to check only odd numbers not divisible by 2 or 3
    
    return x  # n is prime
```

### Explanation:
- The function first handles edge cases (e.g., numbers ≤ 1 are not prime).
- It then checks for divisibility by small primes (2 and 3).
- For efficiency, it uses a loop to check divisibility only for potential factors up to the square root of `n`, skipping even numbers and multiples of 3.
- This implementation is clean, efficient, and executable in any standard Python environment.

You can test it like this:
```python
print(x_or_y(7, 34, 12))  # Output: 34
print(x_or_y(15, 8, 5))   # Output: 5
print(x_or_y(2, 10, 20))  # Output: 10 (2 is prime)

I've also added handling for negative numbers by taking the absolute value, as the GCD is typically defined for positive integers.

```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """""" Return the greatest common divisor of two integers a and b

    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b  # Replace a with b and b with a % b
    return a
```

### Explanation:
- **Edge cases**: If either `a` or `b` is zero, the function will correctly return the absolute value of the non-zero number (e.g., `greatest_common_divisor(0, 5)` returns 5). For `greatest_common_divisor(0, 0)`, it returns 0, though mathematically GCD(0, 0) is undefined.
- **Algorithm**: The Euclidean algorithm iteratively replaces `a` with `b` and `b` with `a % b` until `b` is 0. At that point, `a` is the GCD.
- **Testing**: You can verify the examples in the docstring by running the function in a Python environment.

    return result
```

### Explanation:
- **Edge Case Handling**: If the input list is empty, the function returns an empty list.
- **Logic**: We initialize the result list with the first element of the input list. For each subsequent element, we compare it to the last element in the result list (which represents the maximum so far). If the current element is larger, we add it to the result; otherwise, we add the existing maximum.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input list, as we make a single pass through the list.
- **Example Execution**:

                min_positive = num  # Update to the smaller positive number
    
    return (max_negative, min_positive)
```

### Explanation:
- The function iterates through each element in the list.
- For negative numbers (less than 0), it keeps track of the largest one by comparing and updating `max_negative`.
- For positive numbers (greater than 0), it keeps track of the smallest one by comparing and updating `min_positive`.
- If no negative numbers are found, `max_negative` remains `None`.
- If no positive numbers are found, `min_positive` remains `None`.
- The function returns a tuple `(max_negative, min_positive)`.

This code handles all the examples and edge cases mentioned:
- `largest_smallest_integers([2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7])` returns `(None, 1)`
- `largest_smallest_integers([])` returns `(None, None)`
- `largest_smallest_integers([0])` returns `(None, None)`

            total += ord(char)  # Add its ASCII value to the total
    return total  # Return the final sum
```

### Explanation:
- **Line 1-2**: The function definition with the updated docstring for clarity.
- **Line 8**: We initialize a variable `total` to 0 to store the sum.
- **Line 9-10**: We loop through each character in the input string `s`.
- **Line 11**: We use `char.isupper()` to check if the character is an uppercase letter (e.g., 'A' to 'Z').
- **Line 12**: If it is uppercase, we use `ord(char)` to get its ASCII value and add it to `total`.

        n = n // 2  # Divide n by 2

    # If n is a prime number greater than 2, it is the largest prime factor
    if n > 1:
        max_prime = n
    
    return max_prime
```

### Explanation:
- **Step 1:** First, we divide `n` by 2 as many times as possible and set `max_prime` to 2 if it's a factor.
- **Step 2:** Then, we check for odd factors starting from 3 up to the square root of `n`. For each factor found, we update `max_prime`.
- **Step 3:** After the loop, if `n` is still greater than 1, it means `n` is a prime factor itself, so we update `max_prime` to `n`.
- **Edge Cases:** The function handles numbers like 2048 (powers of 2) and larger composites like 13195 correctly.

You can test this function in a Python environment. For example:

            reversed_prefix = prefix[::-1]  # Reverse the prefix
            return string + reversed_prefix  # Append the reversed prefix to the original string

### Explanation:
- The function iterates through possible starting indices `i` for suffixes of the string (from `i=0` for the full string to `i=n` for the empty string).
- For each `i`, it checks if `string[i:]` is a palindrome using the `is_palindrome` function.
- The first (smallest) `i` where `string[i:]` is a palindrome corresponds to the longest palindromic suffix.
- It then extracts the prefix (`string[:i]`), reverses it, and appends it to the original string to form the shortest palindrome that starts with the input string.

This implementation is clean, efficient, and matches the examples provided in the docstring:
- `make_palindrome('')` returns `''`.
- `make_palindrome('cat')` returns `'catac'`.
- `make_palindrome('cata')` returns `'catac'`.",0.0013867999999999,26.118218421936035,0,0,grok-3-mini,,
humaneval,HumanEval/132,Cascade,1,"Below is the implementation of the function `is_nested` based on the problem description. The function checks if there exists a valid subsequence of brackets in the input string where at least one bracket is nested (i.e., the subsequence forms a valid bracket string with a maximum depth of at least 2).

I used a dynamic programming approach to solve this efficiently. The DP state `dp[i][j][k]` represents:
- `i`: The first `i` characters of the string have been processed.
- `j`: There are `j` unmatched opening brackets in the subsequence.
- `k`: `k=1` if the maximum depth (unmatched openings) in this subsequence so far is at least 2, otherwise `k=0`.

The final result is checked in `dp[n][0][1]`, which indicates if there's a valid subsequence using the entire string (or a subset) that ends with 0 unmatched brackets and had a maximum depth of at least 2.

Here's the clean, executable code:

### Explanation:
- **Time Complexity**: The DP table has O(1 * n * 2) states (since i goes up to n, j up to n, and k is 2 values), and each state involves a constant amount of work, so it's O(1 * n^2).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1 * n * 2) for the DP array, which is O(n^2).

### Explanation:
- **Splitting the string**: We use `re.split(r'[.!?]', S)` to split the input string into parts based on the delimiters. This handles sentences ending with '.', '?', or '!'.
- **Cleaning sentences**: We strip each part of leading/trailing whitespace and filter out any empty strings to avoid false positives.
- **Checking for ""I""**: For each cleaned sentence, we split it into words using `sentence.split()`, which splits on whitespace. We then check if the first word (if it exists) is exactly ""I"" (case-sensitive).
- **Edge cases handled**:
  - Empty string: Returns 0.

I've added the necessary code inside the function to perform the conversion as described in the docstring. The function uses Python's built-in `bin()` function to convert the decimal number to its binary representation, removes the '0b' prefix, and then wraps the result with 'db' at the beginning and end.

    return 'db' + binary_str + 'db'
```

### Explanation:
- **Conversion**: The `bin(decimal)` function converts the decimal number to a binary string prefixed with '0b'. We slice it with `[2:]` to remove the '0b' prefix.
- **Edge Case Handling**: This works for 0 as well, since `bin(0)` is '0b0', and `[2:]` results in '0'.
- **Output Format**: The function prepends 'db' and appends 'db' to the binary string.

### Example Usage:
You can test this function in a Python environment:

```python
print(decimal_to_binary(15))  # Output: ""db1111db""
print(decimal_to_binary(32))  # Output: ""db100000db""
print(decimal_to_binary(0))   # Output: ""db0db""

humaneval,HumanEval/54,Cascade,1,"Here's the implementation of the `same_chars` function based on the provided docstring and examples. The function checks if the two strings contain exactly the same unique characters, regardless of their order or frequency.

```

### Explanation:
- **Logic**: The function uses Python's `set` data structure to extract the unique characters from each string. It then compares the two sets. If they are equal, the strings have the same unique characters.
- **Edge Cases Handled**:
  - Empty strings: `same_chars('', '')` returns `True`.
  - Strings with repeated characters: `same_chars('aaa', 'a')` returns `True` because both have the set `{'a'}`.
  - Case sensitivity: The function treats strings as case-sensitive (e.g., 'A' and 'a' are different characters).
- **Why this works**: The examples in the docstring confirm that we're only interested in the presence of unique characters, not their counts or order.

humaneval,HumanEval/50,Cascade,1,"It looks like you're working on a pair of functions for encoding and decoding strings by shifting characters in the alphabet. The `encode_shift` function is already implemented, which shifts each lowercase letter by 5 positions forward (wrapping around the alphabet).

I'll complete the `decode_shift` function for you. This function should reverse the encoding by shifting each character back by 5 positions, while handling the wrap-around correctly (e.g., 'a' should decode to 'v').

Here's the completed implementation:

```python
def decode_shift(s: str):
    """"""
    Takes as input a string encoded with the encode_shift function and returns the decoded string.
    """"""
    return """".join([chr(((ord(ch) - 5 - ord(""a"")) % 26) + ord(""a"")) for ch in s])
```

### Explanation:
- This function uses a list comprehension to process each character in the input string `s`.
- For each character `ch`:
  - `ord(ch)` gets the ASCII value of the character.
  - Subtract 5 and adjust for the alphabet range by subtracting `ord(""a"")` (to shift to 0-25), applying modulo 26 for wrap-around, and then adding back `ord(""a"")` to convert back to the correct ASCII value.
- The result is joined into a single string and returned.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example with encode_shift
original = ""hello""
encoded = encode_shift(original)  # Output: ""mjqqt""
decoded = decode_shift(encoded)   # Output: ""hello""
print(decoded)  # Should print: hello

humaneval,HumanEval/67,Cascade,1,"It looks like you're providing a problem description and a function signature for `fruit_distribution(s, n)`, and you want me to implement the function based on the description. I'll write clean, executable Python code for this.

The function needs to:
- Parse the input string `s` to extract the number of apples and oranges.
- Subtract those numbers from the total number of fruits `n` to get the number of mangoes.
- Return the result.

I'll assume the string `s` is always in the format: ""<number> apples and <number> oranges"", as per the examples.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    # Split the string into words
    words = s.split()  # e.g., ['5', 'apples', 'and', '6', 'oranges']
    
    # Extract the number of apples (first word)
    apples = int(words[0])  # Convert the first word to an integer
    
    # Extract the number of oranges (second last word, assuming the format is consistent)
    oranges = int(words[-2])  # The word before 'oranges' is the oranges count
    
    # Calculate the number of mangoes
    mangoes = n - apples - oranges  # Total fruits minus apples minus oranges
    
    return mangoes  # Return the result
```

### Explanation:
- **Line 1:** We split the string `s` by spaces to get a list of words.
- **Line 4:** The first element in the list (index 0) is the number of apples, which we convert to an integer.
- **Line 7:** The second-to-last element (index -2) is the number of oranges, as the last element is always 'oranges' based on the examples.
- **Line 10:** We compute the number of mangoes by subtracting the apples and oranges from the total fruits `n`.
- **Line 13:** Return the result.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example 1
print(fruit_distribution(""5 apples and 6 oranges"", 19))  # Output: 8

# Example 2
print(fruit_distribution(""0 apples and 1 oranges"", 3))  # Output: 2

humaneval,HumanEval/115,Cascade,1,"It looks like you're providing a function definition for `max_fill` along with a problem description, but the function body is incomplete. Based on the description, the task is to calculate the total number of times buckets need to be lowered to empty all the wells in the grid. Each row represents a well, and the number of 1s in a row indicates the units of water in that well. For each well, the number of lowerings required is the ceiling of (number of units / bucket capacity), and we sum this across all wells.

I'll complete the function for you. Here's the full, executable code:

```python
def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    total_lowerings = 0  # Initialize the total count of lowerings
    
    for row in grid:  # Iterate through each row (well)
        ones_in_row = row.count(1)  # Count the number of 1s in the row
        if ones_in_row > 0:  # Only calculate if there are units of water
            lowerings_for_row = (ones_in_row + capacity - 1) // capacity  # Ceiling division
            total_lowerings += lowerings_for_row  # Add to the total
    
    return total_lowerings  # Return the final result
```

### Explanation:
- **Logic**: For each row, count the number of 1s (units of water). Then, compute the number of lowerings needed for that row as `(ones_in_row + capacity - 1) // capacity`, which is equivalent to the ceiling of `ones_in_row / capacity`. Sum these values across all rows.
- **Edge Cases Handled**:
  - If a row has no 1s, it adds 0 to the total.
  - If the grid is empty or has all zeros, the function returns 0.
- **Examples**:
  - Example 1: `grid = [[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]]`, `capacity = 1`
    - Row 1: 1 one → ceil(1/1) = 1
    - Row 2: 1 one → ceil(1/1) = 1
    - Row 3: 4 ones → ceil(4/1) = 4

  - Example 2: `grid = [[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]]`, `capacity = 2`
    - Row 1: 2 ones → ceil(2/2) = 1
    - Row 2: 0 ones → ceil(0/2) = 0
    - Row 3: 4 ones → ceil(4/2) = 2
    - Row 4: 3 ones → ceil(3/2) = 2

        result.append(delimeter)  # Add the delimeter
        result.append(numbers[i])  # Add the next element
    return result
```

### Explanation:

    # Join the decoded groups and return the result
    return """".join(decoded_groups)
```

### Explanation:
- **Splitting into groups**: The input string is split into groups of up to 3 characters, mirroring the logic in `encode_cyclic`. This ensures we process the string in the same way it was originally grouped.
- **Decoding logic**: For each group:
  - If the group has exactly 3 characters, it was cyclically shifted left during encoding (e.g., ""abc"" became ""bca""). To reverse this, we perform a right shift (e.g., ""bca"" becomes ""abc"").
  - If the group has fewer than 3 characters, it wasn't changed during encoding, so we leave it as is.
- **Joining and returning**: The decoded groups are joined back into a single string and returned.

### Example Usage:

# Original string
original = ""abcdefg""

# Encode
encoded = encode_cyclic(original)  # Results in ""bcaefdg""

  - Iterates through each word and checks if its length is prime using the `is_prime` function.
  - Collects words with prime lengths in a list (`result_words`).
  - Joins the collected words with spaces and returns the resulting string. If no words have prime lengths, it returns an empty string.

### Example Walkthrough:
1. **Input: ""This is a test""**
   - Words: [""This"", ""is"", ""a"", ""test""]
   - Lengths: 4 (not prime), 2 (prime), 1 (not prime), 4 (not prime)
   - Result: [""is""]
   - Output: ""is""

2. **Input: ""lets go for swimming""**
   - Words: [""lets"", ""go"", ""for"", ""swimming""]
   - Lengths: 4 (not prime), 2 (prime), 3 (prime), 8 (not prime)
   - Result: [""go"", ""for""]
   - Output: ""go for""

humaneval,HumanEval/134,Cascade,1,"Below is the implementation of the function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` based on the problem description. I'll first explain the reasoning briefly, then provide the clean, executable code.

### Reasoning:
- If the string is empty, return `False` since there is no last character.
- Check if the last character of the string is an alphabetical letter using the `isalpha()` method. If it's not, return `False`.
- If the last character is a letter, determine if it is a standalone word (i.e., not part of a larger word). To do this:
  - Scan backwards from the second-to-last character to find the last space.
  - If a space is found, extract the substring from after that space to the end (this is the last word) and check if its length is exactly 1.
  - If no space is found (meaning the entire string is one word), check if the string's length is exactly 1.
- This ensures the last character is both a letter and isolated as a single-word character.

Now, here's the Python code:

```python
def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):
    if not txt:  # Empty string
        return False
    
    last_char = txt[-1]  # Get the last character
    if not last_char.isalpha():  # Check if it's an alphabetical letter
        return False
    
    # Now check if the last character is a standalone word
    for i in range(len(txt) - 2, -1, -1):  # Iterate backwards from the second last character
        if txt[i].isspace():  # If a space is found
            last_word = txt[i+1:]  # Substring from after the space to the end
            return len(last_word) == 1  # True if it's exactly one character
    
    # If no space was found, the whole string is the last word
    return len(txt) == 1  # True only if the string is a single character

# Example usage:
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(""apple pie""))  # Output: False
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(""apple pi e""))  # Output: True
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(""apple pi e ""))  # Output: False
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(""""))  # Output: False

humaneval,HumanEval/42,Cascade,1,"Here's the complete implementation of the `incr_list` function in Python. I've added the function body based on the description in the docstring. The function creates and returns a new list with each element incremented by 1, without modifying the original list.

```python
def incr_list(l: list):
    """"""Return list with elements incremented by 1.
    >>> incr_list([1, 2, 3])
    [2, 3, 4]
    >>> incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])
    [6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]
    """"""
    # Use a list comprehension to create a new list with each element incremented by 1
    return [x + 1 for x in l]
```

### Explanation:
- **Functionality**: The function takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list where each element is increased by 1.
- **Edge Cases Handled**:
  - If the input list is empty (e.g., `incr_list([])`), it returns an empty list `[]`.
  - This implementation assumes the list contains numeric elements (like integers or floats) that can be incremented. If the list contains non-numeric elements, it will raise a `TypeError`.
- **Why this approach?**: Using a list comprehension makes the code clean, efficient, and easy to read.

You can test this function in a Python environment. For example:
```python
print(incr_list([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: [2, 3, 4]
print(incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]))  # Output: [6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]

humaneval,HumanEval/74,Cascade,1,"Below is the complete implementation of the `total_match` function based on the description provided in the docstring. I'll first explain the reasoning briefly, then provide the code.

### Reasoning:
- We need to calculate the total number of characters across all strings in each list.
- Compare the totals:
  - If the total for `lst1` is less than the total for `lst2`, return `lst1`.
  - If the total for `lst2` is less than the total for `lst1`, return `lst2`.
  - If the totals are equal, return `lst1`.
- To compute the total characters in a list, we can use a generator expression with `sum()` to add up the lengths of all strings in the list.
- Edge cases like empty lists are handled naturally: an empty list has a total of 0 characters.
- The function assumes the inputs are lists of strings, as specified in the problem.

Here's the clean, executable Python code:

```python
def total_match(lst1, lst2):
    '''
    Write a function that accepts two lists of strings and returns the list that has 
    total number of chars in the all strings of the list less than the other list.

    if the two lists have the same number of chars, return the first list.

    Examples
    total_match([], []) ➞ []
    total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'Hi']) ➞ ['hI', 'Hi']
    total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hi', 'hi', 'admin', 'project']) ➞ ['hi', 'admin']
    total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'hi', 'hi']) ➞ ['hI', 'hi', 'hi']
    total_match(['4'], ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']) ➞ ['4']
    '''
    # Calculate total characters in lst1
    total1 = sum(len(s) for s in lst1)
    
    # Calculate total characters in lst2
    total2 = sum(len(s) for s in lst2)
    
    # Compare the totals and return the appropriate list
    if total1 < total2:
        return lst1
    elif total2 < total1:
        return lst2
    else:  # total1 == total2
        return lst1
```

### Verification with Examples:
- `total_match([], [])`: Both totals are 0, so return `[]` (first list).
- `total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'Hi'])`: Total for first: 2 + 5 = 7. Total for second: 2 + 2 = 4. 4 < 7, so return `['hI', 'Hi']`.
- `total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hi', 'hi', 'admin', 'project'])`: Total for first: 7. Total for second: 2 + 2 + 5 + 7 = 16. 7 < 16, so return `['hi', 'admin']`.
- `total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'hi', 'hi'])`: Total for first: 7. Total for second: 2 + 2 + 2 = 6. 6 < 7, so return `['hI', 'hi', 'hi']`.
- `total_match(['4'], ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5'])`: Total for first: 1. Total for second: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5. 1 < 5, so return `['4']`.

    """"""
    if not words:  # Handle empty list
        return None  # Return None if the list is empty
    
    # Initialize with the first word
    result = words[0]

    for word in words[1:]:  # Start from the second word
        unique_count = len(set(word))  # Calculate unique characters in the current word
        
        if unique_count > max_unique:
            max_unique = unique_count
            result = word  # Update if this word has more unique characters
        elif unique_count == max_unique:
            if word < result:  # Compare lexicographically
                result = word  # Update if this word is smaller
    
    return result
```

### Explanation:
- **Edge Case Handling**: If the input list `words` is empty, the function returns `None`.
- **Initialization**: The function starts by assuming the first word in the list is the result and calculates its unique character count.
- **Iteration**: For each subsequent word:
  - Compute the number of unique characters using `len(set(word))`, which converts the string to a set to remove duplicates.
  - If the current word has more unique characters than the current maximum, update the maximum and set it as the result.
  - If it has the same number of unique characters, compare it lexicographically (using `<` for string comparison) and update the result if the current word is smaller.
- **Lexicographical Order**: Python's string comparison (`word < result`) is case-sensitive and follows alphabetical order.

### Example Usage:
You can test the function as follows:

```python
# Example 1
print(find_max([""name"", ""of"", ""string""]))  # Output: ""string""

# Example 2
print(find_max([""name"", ""enam"", ""game""]))  # Output: ""enam""

# Example 3
print(find_max([""aaaaaaa"", ""bb"", ""cc""]))  # Output: ""aaaaaaa""

# Additional edge case
print(find_max([]))  # Output: None
print(find_max([""single""]))  # Output: ""single""
```
