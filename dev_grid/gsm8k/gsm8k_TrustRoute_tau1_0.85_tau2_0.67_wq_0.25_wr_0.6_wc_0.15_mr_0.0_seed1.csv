1. **Calculate the total number of eggs laid per day**: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.

2. **Determine how many eggs she consumes**:
   - She eats 3 eggs for breakfast.
   - She uses 4 eggs for baking muffins.
   - Total eggs consumed = 3 + 4 = 7 eggs.

3. **Calculate the number of eggs remaining for sale**:
   - Eggs remaining = Total eggs laid - Eggs consumed
   - Eggs remaining = 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

4. **Calculate the revenue from selling the remaining eggs**:
   - Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 per egg.
   - Total revenue = Number of eggs sold × Price per egg
   - Total revenue = 9 × 2 = $18.

1. **Calculate the total investment**: This includes the purchase price of the house and the cost of repairs.
   - Purchase price: $80,000
   - Repairs: $50,000
   - Total investment = Purchase price + Repairs = $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

2. **Calculate the increased value of the house**: The value of the house increased by 150%. 
   - Increased value = Original value + (150% of Original value)
   - Original value = Purchase price = $80,000
   - 150% of $80,000 = 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000

1. **Understand the problem**: We have two trains that start from San Rafael and follow the same route. On the first day, each train travels 80 miles westward. On the second day, each train travels 150 miles northward. We're asked for the total distance covered by each train over the two days.
   
2. **Define distance covered**: Distance refers to the total length of the path traveled, not the straight-line displacement (which would be a vector calculation). So, we simply add up the distances traveled each day for each train.

3. **Calculate for each train**:
   - Train 1: Travels 80 miles on Day 1 + 150 miles on Day 2 = 230 miles total.
   - Train 2: Also travels 80 miles on Day 1 + 150 miles on Day 2 = 230 miles total.

gsm8k,gsm8k-33,TrustRoute,1,"Gretchen has a total of 110 coins, and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Let's solve this step by step.

Let:
- \( S \) be the number of silver coins.
- \( G \) be the number of gold coins.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. The total number of coins is 110, so:  
   \( G + S = 110 \)
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, so:  
   \( G = S + 30 \)

Substitute the second equation into the first:  
\( (S + 30) + S = 110 \)  
\( 2S + 30 = 110 \)

Subtract 30 from both sides:  
\( 2S = 80 \)

Divide both sides by 2:  
\( S = 40 \)

Now, substitute \( S = 40 \) back into the second equation:  
\( G = 40 + 30 = 70 \)

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.  

To verify:  
- Silver coins: 40  
- Gold coins: 70  
- Total: 40 + 70 = 110

1. **Calculate the cost per trip:**  
   Peter spends $7 on a ticket and $7 on popcorn for each trip.

   This means he can afford exactly 3 trips.

- The team played a total of 22 games.

- Assuming all games resulted in either a win or a loss (no draws, as the problem doesn't mention them), the total games can be expressed as:

### Step 1: Identify the given information
- The number of dogs is 60.
- There are two cats for every dog.
- The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of cats
- Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs:
  - Number of cats = 2 × 60 = 120.

### Step 3: Calculate the combined number of dogs and cats
- Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats

1.  **Adrien's initial salary (four years ago):**
    Adrien earned $40,000 four years ago.

2.  **Lylah's initial salary (four years ago):**
    Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. This means Adrien's salary was 130% of Lylah's salary.
    Let Lylah's initial salary be $L_0$.
    $40,000 = 1.30 \times L_0$
    $L_0 = \frac{40,000}{1.30} \approx \$30,769.23$

3.  **Adrien's new salary (four years later):**
    Adrien's salary increased by 40% from his initial salary.
    Adrien's new salary = $40,000 \times (1 + 0.40)$
    Adrien's new salary = $40,000 \times 1.40$
    Adrien's new salary = $56,000

4.  **Lylah's new salary (four years later):**
    The problem states that their salaries increased simultaneously. The most reasonable interpretation, given no specific percentage increase for Lylah, is that the initial relationship between their salaries (Adrien earning 30% more than Lylah) is maintained after the increase. This also happens to be mathematically equivalent to Lylah's salary also increasing by 40%.
    Let Lylah's new salary be $L_{new}$.
    Adrien's new salary = $1.30 \times L_{new}$
    $56,000 = 1.30 \times L_{new}$
    $L_{new} = \frac{56,000}{1.30} \approx \$43,076.92$

5.  **Total salary of the two four years later:**
    Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary

- Bags of chips: 2 at $1.50 each = 2 × $1.50 = $3.00
- Cookies: 2 at $1.00 each = 2 × $1.00 = $2.00

### Step 1: Bees leaving and returning timeline
- **First 6 hours**: 30 bees leave the hive.
  - Bees out: 30

- **Next 6 hours (hours 7-12)**: 1/2 of the bees that left in the first 6 hours return.
  - 1/2 of 30 = 15 bees return.
  - Bees still out from the first batch: 30 - 15 = 15

- **Next 6 hours (hours 13-18)**: Two times as many bees as left in the first 6 hours leave the hive.
  - Two times 30 = 60 bees leave.
  - Bees still out from the first batch: 15
  - Bees out from this batch: 60
  - Total bees out: 15 + 60 = 75

- **Last 6 hours (hours 19-24)**: Every bee that left before this period and hadn't already returned returns to the hive.
  - Bees that left before hours 19-24: The 30 bees from the first 6 hours and the 60 bees from hours 13-18.
  - Of the 30 bees from the first 6 hours, 15 had already returned in hours 7-12, so 15 hadn't returned.
  - Of the 60 bees from hours 13-18, none had returned yet.
  - Therefore, the bees returning in hours 19-24: 15 (from the first batch) + 60 (from the second batch) = 75 bees.

### Step 1: Convert miles to feet
1 mile = 5280 feet.

- **Steve's Distance**: 3 miles = \(3 \times 5280 = 15840\) feet.
- **Tim's Distance**: 2 miles = \(2 \times 5280 = 10560\) feet.

### Step 2: Calculate the time taken for each person to get home
Time is calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

#### For Steve:
- Speed = 440 feet per minute.
- Distance = 15840 feet.

\[
\text{Time}_{\text{Steve}} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}

#### For Tim:
- Speed = 264 feet per minute.
- Distance = 10560 feet.

### Step 1: Calculate the total length of the rolls
- Each roll is 4 inches long.
- Convert to feet: 4 inches = 4 / 12 = 1/3 feet (approximately 0.333 feet).
- There are 300 rolls.
- Total length for rolls: 300 × (1/3) feet = 100 feet.

### Step 2: Calculate the total length of the chocolate croissants
- Each croissant is 6 inches long.

**Blake's Distance:**
Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard football field. Each back-and-forth run consists of running 100 yards to one end and then 100 yards back, which totals 200 yards for each complete back-and-forth.

So, for 15 back-and-forth runs:
\[
\text{Distance Blake runs} = 15 \times 200 \text{ yards} = 3000 \text{ yards}
\]

**Kelly's Distance:**
Kelly runs back and forth once on the 100-yard field, which is:
\[
\text{Distance for one back-and-forth} = 200 \text{ yards}
\]

After that, she runs to the 40-yard line and back. The distance to the 40-yard line is 40 yards, and the distance back is also 40 yards, making it:
\[
\text{Distance to 40-yard line and back} = 40 + 40 = 80 \text{ yards}
\]

Kelly repeats this 34 times:
\[
\text{Total distance for 34 runs to 40-yard line and back} = 34 \times 80 \text{ yards} = 2720 \text{ yards}

Now, we add the distance Kelly ran on the football field to the distance she ran to the 40-yard line and back:
\[

To find out how much farther the winner (Blake) runs than the loser (Kelly):

   \[
   S = 2B
   \]

2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28:
   \[
   (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28
   \]

We can simplify the second equation:
\[
S + B + 4 = 28
\]
Subtracting 4 from both sides gives:
\[
S + B = 24
\]

Now we have a system of equations:
1. \( S = 2B \)
2. \( S + B = 24 \)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[
2B + B = 24
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
3B = 24
\]
Dividing both sides by 3 gives:
\[
B = 8
\]

Now we can find Seth's age using the first equation:
\[
S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16
\]

Thus, Seth is currently **16 years old**.",0.00311775,13.883462905883789,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,

1. **Understanding the distribution of straw:**
   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - There are 3 cages of rats, and they are kept in equal groups.
   - Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw, and there are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - A total of 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

2. **Calculating the total straw used for hamsters and rabbits:**
   - For the hamsters:
     - Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
     - Let \( h \) be the number of hamsters in each cage. Then the total straw for hamsters is:
       \[
       \text{Total straw for hamsters} = 10 \times h \times 5 = 50h
       \]
   - For the rabbits:
     - Total straw for rabbits = 20 pieces.

3. **Setting up the equation:**
   - The total straw distributed among all rodents is 160 pieces. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   \text{Total straw for rats} + \text{Total straw for hamsters} + \text{Total straw for rabbits} = 160
   \]
   - The total straw for rats can be expressed as:
     - Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage. Then the total straw for rats is:
       \[
       \text{Total straw for rats} = 3 \times r \times 6 = 18r
       \]
   - Substituting the expressions into the equation gives:
   \[
   18r + 50h + 20 = 160
   \]

4. **Simplifying the equation:**
   \[
   18r + 50h = 160 - 20
   \]
   \[
   18r + 50h = 140
   \]

5. **Finding integer solutions:**
   - We can simplify this equation by dividing everything by 2:
   \[
   9r + 25h = 70
   \]

6. **Finding possible values for \( r \) and \( h \):**
   - We can try different integer values for \( h \) and solve for \( r \):
     - If \( h = 0 \):
       \[
       9r = 70 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
       \]
     - If \( h = 1 \):
       \[
       9r + 25 = 70 \implies 9r = 45 \implies r = 5
       \]
     - If \( h = 2 \):
       \[
       9r + 50 = 70 \implies 9r = 20 \quad \text{(not an integer)}

- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n months, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (as a decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of months the money is borrowed.

In this case:
- \( P = 100 \) (the amount Mandy owes)

2. **Cost of food**: They spent $4.50 less on food than on tickets. 
   \[
   \text{Cost of food} = \text{Cost of tickets} - 4.50 = 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75

1. **Initial Flamingos**: On Friday, Sue had 18 pink flamingos in her yard.

2. **Saturday's Changes**:
   - The neighbors took back one third of the flamingos. 
   - One third of 18 is calculated as:
     \[
     \frac{18}{3} = 6
     \]
   - So, 6 flamingos were taken back and painted white. 

3. **After Saturday**:
   - The number of pink flamingos left is:
     \[
     18 - 6 = 12
     \]
   - The number of white flamingos added is 6.

4. **Sunday's Changes**:
   - On Sunday, the neighbors added another 18 pink flamingos. 
   - The total number of pink flamingos now is:

1. **Determine the payment from Publisher A**:
   - Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers. Since he edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B.
   - Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence.
   - Therefore, the payment from Publisher A is:
     \[
     \text{Payment from A} = 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents}
     \]

2. **Determine the payment from Publisher B**:
   - Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays. Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, Publisher B pays:
     \[
     \text{Payment per sentence from B} = 2 \times 5 \text{ cents} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence}
     \]
   - Therefore, the payment from Publisher B is:
