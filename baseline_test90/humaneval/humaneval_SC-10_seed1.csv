humaneval,HumanEval/119,SC-10,1,"To determine if two strings of parentheses can be concatenated in some order to form a balanced string, we can follow these steps:

1. Count the number of open parentheses `(` and close parentheses `)` in both strings.
2. For a concatenated string to be balanced, the total number of open parentheses must equal the total number of close parentheses.
3. Additionally, while traversing the concatenated string, at no point should the number of close parentheses exceed the number of open parentheses.

Here's the implementation of the `match_parens` function based on the above logic:

- We iterate through each character in the input `message`.
- If the character is a letter, we check if it is a vowel:
  - If it is a vowel, we calculate the new character by finding its position in the alphabet, adding 2, and wrapping around using modulo 26.
  - If it is not a vowel, we simply swap its case.
- Non-letter characters are appended to the result unchanged.

humaneval,HumanEval/1,SC-10,1,"To solve the problem of separating groups of nested parentheses from a given string, we can follow these steps:

1. **Remove Spaces**: First, we need to ignore any spaces in the input string.
2. **Initialize Variables**: We'll use a list to store the separated groups and a counter to keep track of the balance of parentheses.
3. **Iterate Through the String**: As we iterate through the characters in the string:
   - If we encounter an opening parenthesis `(`, we increase our balance counter.
   - If we encounter a closing parenthesis `)`, we decrease our balance counter.
   - When the balance counter returns to zero, it indicates that we have a complete group of balanced parentheses. We can then extract this group and add it to our list.
4. **Return the Result**: Finally, we return the list of separated groups.

Here's the implementation of the above logic:

```python

# Example usage
print(separate_paren_groups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))'))  # Output: ['()', '(())', '(()())']
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We first remove spaces from the input string using `replace`.
- We initialize `groups` to store the results, `balance` to track the nesting level, and `current_group` to build the current group of parentheses.
- As we loop through each character, we update the `balance` and check if it returns to zero, indicating a complete group.
- When a complete group is found, we join the characters in `current_group` into a string and append it to `groups`.

   - We check if `current_sum` is less than `min_sum` and update `min_sum` accordingly.
   - If `current_sum` becomes positive, we reset it to 0 because we want to find the minimum sum of sub-arrays, and a positive sum will not contribute to a smaller sum.

1. **Conversion Function**: The `convert_to_float` function converts a string representation of a number to a float, replacing commas with dots to ensure proper conversion.
2. **Comparison Logic**: The `compare_one` function converts both inputs to floats and compares them. Depending on the comparison result, it returns the original value of the larger number or `None` if they are equal.
3. **Error Handling**: If the conversion fails (for example, if the string cannot be interpreted as a number), the function returns `None`.

1. **Understanding the Movement**: Each car from the left-to-right set will eventually meet each car from the right-to-left set. Since all cars are moving at the same speed, every car from one direction will collide with every car from the other direction.

2. **Counting Collisions**: If there are `n` cars moving left to right and `n` cars moving right to left, each car from the first set will collide with each car from the second set. Therefore, the total number of collisions can be calculated as:

humaneval,HumanEval/109,SC-10,1,"To determine if we can sort the array in non-decreasing order by performing right shift operations, we can utilize the following approach:

1. **Understanding Right Shift**: A right shift operation moves the last element of the array to the front. This means that the array can be viewed as a circular array, where we can start from any index and consider the elements in a linear fashion.

2. **Identifying Sorted Segments**: For the array to be sortable by right shifts, there must be at most one point in the array where the order breaks (i.e., where a larger number is followed by a smaller number). This point indicates a potential ""wrap-around"" in the circular view of the array.

3. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Traverse the array and count how many times the order breaks (i.e., when an element is greater than the next element).
   - If there is more than one break, it is impossible to sort the array using right shifts.

4. **Edge Cases**: An empty array is considered sorted, so we return `True` for that case.

Here is the implementation of the above logic in Python:

If at any point the count of closing brackets exceeds the count of opening brackets, we can immediately return `False`. At the end of the iteration, if the counts are equal, we return `True`; otherwise, we return `False`.

   - If we encounter a closing bracket `>`, we decrement the `balance`.
3. If at any point the `balance` becomes negative, it means there are more closing brackets than opening brackets, and we return `False`.

   - Increment the count for each number that meets these criteria.

humaneval,HumanEval/110,SC-10,1,"To solve the problem of determining whether we can exchange elements between two lists to make all elements of the first list even, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Odd Numbers in `lst1`:** We need to check how many odd numbers are present in `lst1` because these are the numbers we need to replace with even numbers from `lst2`.

2. **Identify the Even Numbers in `lst2`:** We also need to check if `lst2` contains any even numbers that can be used to replace the odd numbers in `lst1`.

3. **Check Conditions:** If `lst1` has any odd numbers and `lst2` has at least one even number, then it is possible to make all elements of `lst1` even by exchanging. If `lst1` has odd numbers but `lst2` has no even numbers, then it is not possible.

4. **Return the Result:** Based on the checks, return ""YES"" if the exchange can be made, otherwise return ""NO"".

Here is the implementation of the above logic in Python:

```python
def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    # Check for odd numbers in lst1
    has_odd_in_lst1 = any(x % 2 != 0 for x in lst1)
    
    # Check for even numbers in lst2

### Explanation:
1. **Length Check**: The function first checks if the length of the string `s` is less than 3. If it is, the function returns `False`.
2. **Substring Check**: It then iterates through the string, checking each substring of three consecutive characters. 
3. **Distinct Check**: For each substring, it converts it to a set (which removes duplicates) and checks if the length of the set is 3. If it is not, it means there are repeated characters, and the function returns `False`.

humaneval,HumanEval/6,SC-10,1,"To implement the `parse_nested_parens` function, we need to process the input string, which contains groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces. For each group, we will determine the maximum level of nesting of parentheses.

- For each group, we initialize `max_depth` to track the maximum nesting level and `current_depth` to track the current level of nesting.
- We iterate through each character in the group:
  - If we encounter `(`, we increase the `current_depth` and update `max_depth` if the current depth exceeds the previous maximum.

```

### Explanation:
1. We initialize an empty list `result` to store the output.
2. We loop through numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
3. For each index `i`:
   - If `i` is even, we calculate the factorial by multiplying all integers from 1 to `i`.
   - If `i` is odd, we calculate the sum of integers from 1 to `i` using the `sum` function.
4. We append the calculated value to the `result` list.
5. Finally, we return the `result` list.

### Explanation:
1. **Removing Duplicates and Sorting**: We first convert the list to a set to remove duplicates and then sort it. This allows us to use the two-pointer technique effectively.
2. **Iterating through the List**: We iterate through each element in the sorted list. For each element `l[i]`, we set a target value which is the negative of `l[i]`.
3. **Two-Pointer Technique**: We initialize two pointers, `left` (starting just after `i`) and `right` (at the end of the list). We check the sum of the elements at these two pointers:
   - If the sum equals the target, we found three numbers that sum to zero.
   - If the sum is less than the target, we move the `left` pointer to the right to increase the sum.
   - If the sum is greater than the target, we move the `right` pointer to the left to decrease the sum.
4. **Return Value**: If we find any triplet that sums to zero, we return `True`. If we finish checking all possibilities without finding such a triplet, we return `False`.

humaneval,HumanEval/73,SC-10,1,"To solve the problem of finding the minimum number of changes needed to make an array palindromic, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the structure of a palindrome**: A palindromic array reads the same forwards and backwards. This means that for an array `arr`, the first element must match the last element, the second element must match the second-to-last element, and so on.

2. **Count mismatches**: We can iterate through the first half of the array and compare each element with its corresponding element from the end of the array. Each time we find a mismatch, we will need to count that as a required change.

3. **Return the count of changes**: The total count of mismatches will give us the minimum number of changes required to make the array palindromic.

```

### Explanation:
1. **Counting Frequencies**: We use `Counter` from the `collections` module to count how many times each integer appears in the list.
2. **Finding the Result**: We iterate through the items in the frequency dictionary. For each integer, we check if its frequency is greater than or equal to its value. If it is, we compare it with the current maximum result and update the result accordingly.
3. **Return Value**: Finally, we return the greatest integer found that meets the criteria, or -1 if no such integer exists.

humaneval,HumanEval/129,SC-10,1,"To solve the problem of finding the minimum path of length `k` in a grid, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. The key steps are to explore all possible paths starting from each cell in the grid, keeping track of the values encountered along the path, and ensuring that we only consider paths of the specified length `k`. 

Here's the implementation of the `minPath` function:

```python
def minPath(grid, k):
    from collections import deque
    
    N = len(grid)
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]  # Right, Down, Left, Up
    min_path = None
    
    def dfs(x, y, path):
        nonlocal min_path
        
        # If we have reached the path length k
        if len(path) == k:
            if min_path is None or path < min_path:
                min_path = path[:]
            return
        
        # Explore neighbors
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            
            # Check if the new position is within bounds
            if 0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N:
                path.append(grid[nx][ny])  # Add the value to the path
                dfs(nx, ny, path)           # Recur for the next cell
                path.pop()                  # Backtrack
        
    # Start DFS from every cell in the grid
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            dfs(i, j, [grid[i][j]])  # Start path with the current cell value
            
    return min_path

# Example usage
grid1 = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
k1 = 3
print(minPath(grid1, k1))  # Output: [1, 2, 1]

grid2 = [[5, 9, 3], [4, 1, 6], [7, 8, 2]]
k2 = 1
print(minPath(grid2, k2))  # Output: [1]
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: We define the grid size `N` and the possible movement directions (up, down, left, right).
2. **DFS Function**: The `dfs` function takes the current cell coordinates `(x, y)` and the current path as arguments. It checks if the path length has reached `k`. If so, it compares the current path with the minimum path found so far and updates it if the current path is lexicographically smaller.
3. **Exploring Neighbors**: For each cell, we explore its neighbors. If a neighbor is within the grid bounds, we append its value to the current path and recursively call `dfs` for that neighbor.
4. **Backtracking**: After exploring a neighbor, we remove the last added value (backtrack) to explore other paths.
5. **Starting DFS**: We initiate the DFS from every cell in the grid, starting each path with the value of the current cell.

This approach ensures that we explore all possible paths of length `k` and find the lexicographically smallest one efficiently.",0.0046317,76.0794746875763,,True,
humaneval,HumanEval/63,SC-10,1,"To compute the n-th element of the FibFib number sequence efficiently, we can use an iterative approach to avoid the exponential time complexity of a naive recursive solution. Here’s the implementation of the `fibfib` function:

def fibfib(n: int) -> int:
    """"""Compute the n-th element of the FibFib number sequence.""""""
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:

    fibfib_sequence = [0, 0, 1]
    
    # Compute the sequence iteratively
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        next_value = fibfib_sequence[i - 1] + fibfib_sequence[i - 2] + fibfib_sequence[i - 3]

# Example usage
print(fibfib(1))  # Output: 0
print(fibfib(5))  # Output: 4
print(fibfib(8))  # Output: 24
```

### Explanation:
1. **Base Cases**: The function first checks for the base cases where `n` is 0, 1, or 2, returning the corresponding values directly.
2. **Iterative Calculation**: For `n >= 3`, it initializes a list `fibfib_sequence` with the first three values. It then iteratively computes the next values in the sequence using the defined relation: `fibfib(n) = fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-3)`.
3. **Return Value**: Finally, it returns the n-th value from the list.

This approach runs in O(n) time and uses O(n) space, making it efficient for calculating the FibFib numbers.",0.0029615999999999,56.21212959289551,,True,

humaneval,HumanEval/83,SC-10,1,"To solve the problem of counting the n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1, we can break it down into a few steps:

1. **Understanding n-digit integers**: An n-digit integer ranges from \(10^{(n-1)}\) to \(10^n - 1\). For example, for \(n = 3\), the range is from 100 to 999.

2. **Counting integers that start with 1**: If an n-digit integer starts with 1, it can be represented as \(1xxxx\), where \(xxxx\) can be any combination of digits. The remaining \(n-1\) digits can be anything from 0 to 9. Therefore, there are \(10^{(n-1)}\) such integers.

3. **Counting integers that end with 1**: If an n-digit integer ends with 1, it can be represented as \(xxxx1\). The first digit (the most significant digit) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since it cannot be 0 for an n-digit number), and the remaining \(n-2\) digits can be anything from 0 to 9. Thus, there are \(9 \times 10^{(n-2)}\) such integers.

4. **Avoiding double counting**: Some integers both start and end with 1 (e.g., 101, 111, etc.). These integers can be represented as \(1xx1\), where the two middle digits can be anything from 0 to 9. There are \(10^{(n-2)}\) such integers.

5. **Final calculation**: Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the total count of n-digit integers that start or end with 1 is:
   \[
   \text{Total} = (\text{Count starting with 1}) + (\text{Count ending with 1}) - (\text{Count starting and ending with 1})
   \]

Now, let's implement this logic in the function `starts_one_ends`:

    Given a positive integer n, return the count of the numbers of n-digit
    positive integers that start or end with 1.

- We then check if any substring of length equal to `b` from `b_rotations` exists in `a`.
- The use of a generator expression allows us to efficiently check each rotation without explicitly generating a list of all rotations.",0.0025134,40.1636335849762,,True,

1. **Generate the array `a`** based on the formula provided: \( a[i] = i^2 - i + 1 \).
2. **Count the number of valid triples** `(a[i], a[j], a[k])` such that \( i < j < k \) and the sum \( a[i] + a[j] + a[k] \) is a multiple of 3.

```python
def get_max_triples(n):

### Explanation of the Code:
- We first create the list `a` using a list comprehension that applies the formula for each index from 1 to `n`.
- We then use three nested loops to iterate through all possible combinations of indices `(i, j, k)` where \( i < j < k \).
- For each combination, we check if the sum of the corresponding elements in `a` is a multiple of 3.
- If it is, we increment our count.
- Finally, we return the count of valid triples.

2. It uses a while loop that continues until `b` becomes zero.
3. Inside the loop, it updates `a` to `b` and `b` to `a % b` (the remainder of `a` divided by `b`).
4. When `b` is zero, `a` contains the GCD, which is returned as the absolute value to ensure it's non-negative.

For each element in the list, we will compare it with the current maximum and update the maximum if the current element is greater. We will then append the current maximum to the result list.

Here’s the complete implementation of the `rolling_max` function:

```python
from typing import List

def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """""" From a given list of integers, generate a list of rolling maximum element found until given moment
    in the sequence.

    print(rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2]))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: We start by checking if the input list is empty. If it is, we return an empty list. We initialize `result` to store the rolling maximums and set `current_max` to the first element of the list.
2. **Iteration**: We loop through each number in the list, updating `current_max` to be the maximum of `current_max` and the current number.
3. **Appending Results**: After updating `current_max`, we append it to the `result` list.
4. **Return**: Finally, we return the `result` list containing the rolling maximums.

humaneval,HumanEval/132,SC-10,1,"To determine if a string containing only square brackets has a valid subsequence where at least one bracket is nested, we can implement the `is_nested` function. The function will check for valid pairs of brackets and ensure that at least one pair is nested.

2. Iterate through the string, incrementing the counter for each opening bracket `[` and decrementing it for each closing bracket `]`.

4. If the counter goes negative at any point, it indicates an unmatched closing bracket, and we can return `False`.
5. After processing the string, if the counter is not zero, it indicates unmatched opening brackets, and we return `False`.

2. **Calculate Buckets Needed**: For each row, determine how many times we need to lower the bucket based on the capacity. This can be done by dividing the count of water units by the bucket capacity and rounding up (since any remainder means we need an additional lowering).
3. **Sum the Total**: Finally, sum the total number of times buckets need to be lowered across all rows.

humaneval,HumanEval/5,SC-10,1,"To implement the `intersperse` function, we need to insert the specified `delimeter` between every two consecutive elements of the input list `numbers`. Here's how we can achieve this:

1. If the input list is empty, we should return an empty list.
2. For a non-empty list, we can iterate through the elements and add the `delimeter` after each element except the last one.

Here is the complete implementation of the `intersperse` function:

```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    """""" Insert a number 'delimeter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers'
    >>> intersperse([], 4)

        if i < len(numbers) - 1:  # Avoid adding delimiter after the last element
            result.append(delimeter)
    
    return result
```

### Explanation:
- We first check if the `numbers` list is empty. If it is, we return an empty list.
- We create an empty list `result` to hold the final output.
- We loop through the indices of the `numbers` list. For each element, we append it to `result`.
- If the current index is not the last index, we append the `delimeter` to `result`.
- Finally, we return the `result` list.

### Example Usage:

We also need to ensure that the rotation wraps around the alphabet, meaning that after 'z', it should continue from 'a'.

Here's the implementation of the `encrypt` function:

```python
def encrypt(s):
    """"""Encrypts a string by rotating each letter down the alphabet by 4 positions.""""""

print(encrypt('gf'))          # Should return 'kj'
print(encrypt('et'))          # Should return 'ix'
```

### Explanation:
1. **Loop through each character**: We iterate through each character in the input string.
2. **Check if it's a letter**: We only want to encrypt alphabetic characters.
3. **Calculate the new character**: We use the `ord()` function to get the ASCII value of the character, adjust it by subtracting the ASCII value of 'a', add 4 (for the rotation), and then use modulo 26 to wrap around if necessary. Finally, we convert it back to a character using `chr()`.
4. **Join the result**: We collect all the encrypted characters in a list and join them to form the final encrypted string.
