mbpp,Mbpp/620,TrustRoute-NoCost,1,"To solve the problem of finding the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair in the subset is divisible, we can follow these steps:

1. **Sort the List**: Start by sorting the list of numbers. This helps in easily checking divisibility since if `a` divides `b`, then `a` must be less than or equal to `b`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: Use a dynamic programming array where each index `i` represents the size of the largest divisible subset that ends with the number at index `i`.

3. **Check Divisibility**: For each number, check all previous numbers to see if they can form a divisible pair. If they can, update the size of the subset accordingly.

4. **Return the Maximum Size**: Finally, the maximum value in the dynamic programming array will give us the size of the largest subset.

Here is the implementation of the above logic in Python:

```python
def largest_subset(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    
    # Sort the numbers
    nums.sort()
    
    # Create a DP array to store the size of the largest divisible subset ending at each index
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    
    # Fill the DP array
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:  # Check if nums[j] divides nums[i]
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    
    # The result is the maximum value in the dp array
    return max(dp)

# Test the function with the provided assertion
assert largest_subset([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]) == 4
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We first check if the input list is empty and return 0 if it is.
- We sort the input list to facilitate the divisibility checks.
- We initialize a dynamic programming array `dp` where each element starts with 1, indicating that the smallest subset size for each number is itself.
- We use two nested loops to check each pair of numbers. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, we update `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.
- Finally, we return the maximum value found in the `dp` array, which represents the size of the largest divisible subset.",0.00032655,6.08521032333374,,True,

Here's the approach we'll take:
1. Convert the binary string into an array where each '0' is treated as +1 and each '1' is treated as -1.
2. Use a variation of Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray in this transformed array. The maximum sum will correspond to the maximum difference between the number of 0s and 1s.

Here's the implementation of the function:

```python

### Explanation:
- We first create a list `transformed_array` where '0' becomes +1 and '1' becomes -1.
- We then iterate through this array, maintaining a `current_sum` that tracks the sum of the current subarray. If `current_sum` exceeds `max_sum`, we update `max_sum`.
- If `current_sum` drops below zero, we reset it to zero, as starting a new subarray might yield a better result.
- Finally, we return `max_sum`, which represents the maximum difference between the number of 0s and 1s in any substring of the original binary string.",0.000276,5.356191635131836,,True,

However, the expected output in the assertion is `[10, 20, 30, 15]`, which is a specific order. To ensure that we maintain the order of the first list while excluding elements from the second list, we can simply return the filtered list without changing the order:

1. Initialize a `dp` array where `dp[i]` will store the maximum product of an increasing subsequence that ends with the element at index `i`.

mbpp,Mbpp/247,TrustRoute-NoCost,1,"To find the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in a given string, we can use dynamic programming. A palindromic subsequence is a sequence that reads the same backward as forward, and it can be formed by deleting some characters from the string without changing the order of the remaining characters.

Here is a Python function that implements this logic:

```python

    s = s.replace("" "", """").lower()
    
    n = len(s)

    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    
    # Every single character is a palindrome of length 1
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i][i] = 1
    
    # Build the dp array
    for length in range(2, n + 1):  # length of the substring

    return dp[0][n - 1]

# Test the function with the provided assertion
assert lps(""TENS FOR TENS"") == 5
```

### Explanation:
1. **Preprocessing**: The function first removes spaces and converts the string to lowercase to ensure that the comparison is case insensitive and ignores spaces.
2. **Dynamic Programming Table**: A 2D list `dp` is created where `dp[i][j]` will hold the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the substring `s[i:j+1]`.
3. **Base Case**: Each character is a palindrome of length 1, so we initialize `dp[i][i] = 1`.
4. **Filling the Table**: We iterate over all possible substring lengths and fill the `dp` table based on whether the characters at the current ends of the substring are equal or not.
5. **Result**: The length of the longest palindromic subsequence for the entire string is found in `dp[0][n-1]`.

2. **Find the maximum sum of decreasing subsequences**: Similarly, calculate the maximum sum of decreasing subsequences that start at each element.

3. **Combine the results**: For each element in the array, the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence that has that element as the peak can be calculated by adding the maximum sum of the increasing subsequence ending at that element and the maximum sum of the decreasing subsequence starting at that element, subtracting the value of the peak element (since it is counted in both sums).

Here's how we can implement this:

1. Create a 2D list to store the maximum total cost to reach each cell.

mbpp,Mbpp/592,TrustRoute-NoCost,1,"To solve the problem of finding the sum of the product of consecutive binomial coefficients, we can use the following approach:

1. The binomial coefficient \( C(n, k) \) is defined as \( \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \).
2. We need to compute the product of consecutive binomial coefficients for a given \( n \) and then sum these products.

The consecutive binomial coefficients for a given \( n \) are \( C(n, 0), C(n, 1), C(n, 2), \ldots, C(n, n) \). The product of consecutive coefficients can be represented as \( C(n, k) \times C(n, k+1) \).

Here is the Python function that implements this logic:

```python

def sum_Of_product(n):
    total_sum = 0
    for k in range(n):

### Explanation:
- We use the `math.comb` function to compute the binomial coefficients.
- We loop through \( k \) from 0 to \( n-1 \) (since we need pairs \( (k, k+1) \)).
- For each \( k \), we calculate the product of \( C(n, k) \) and \( C(n, k+1) \) and add it to the total sum.
- Finally, we return the total sum.

mbpp,Mbpp/239,TrustRoute-NoCost,1,"To solve the problem of finding the number of possible sequences of length `n` where each element is a positive integer that is at least twice the previous element and at most `m`, we can use a recursive approach with memoization to efficiently compute the result.

Here's how we can implement the function `get_total_number_of_sequences`:

1. Define a recursive function that takes the current element of the sequence and the remaining length of the sequence to be formed.
2. For each valid current element, calculate the next possible elements that can be added to the sequence (which must be at least twice the current element and at most `m`).
3. Use memoization to store results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.

Here's the implementation in Python:

```python
def get_total_number_of_sequences(m, n):
    # Memoization dictionary
    memo = {}

    def count_sequences(current, length):
        # Base case: if the length is 0, we found a valid sequence
        if length == 0:
            return 1
        # If the current value exceeds m, no valid sequences can be formed
        if current > m:
            return 0
        # Check if the result is already computed
        if (current, length) in memo:

```

### Explanation:
- The function `get_total_number_of_sequences` initializes a memoization dictionary to store results of subproblems.
- The inner function `count_sequences` recursively counts the valid sequences starting from a given `current` value and a specified `length`.
- The base case checks if the length is zero, indicating a valid sequence has been formed.
- The loop generates the next possible values that can follow the current value, ensuring they are at least double the current value and do not exceed `m`.
- Finally, we iterate over all possible starting values from 1 to `m` and accumulate the total number of valid sequences.

mbpp,Mbpp/799,TrustRoute-NoCost,1,"To implement a function that rotates the bits of a given 32-bit number to the left by a specified number of bits, we can use bitwise operations. The left rotation can be achieved by shifting the bits to the left and wrapping around the bits that overflow back to the right side.

Here's the implementation of the `left_rotate` function:

```python
def left_rotate(n, d):
    # Ensure d is within the range of 0 to 31
    d = d % 32
    # Perform the left rotation
    return ((n << d) | (n >> (32 - d))) & 0xFFFFFFFF

# Test the function with the provided assertion
assert left_rotate(16, 2) == 64
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Handling**: The function takes two parameters: `n` (the number to rotate) and `d` (the number of bits to rotate left).
2. **Modulo Operation**: We use `d % 32` to ensure that the number of bits to rotate does not exceed 31, as rotating by 32 bits would return the original number.
3. **Left Rotation**:
   - `n << d`: This shifts the bits of `n` to the left by `d` positions.
   - `n >> (32 - d)`: This shifts the bits of `n` to the right by `(32 - d)` positions to capture the bits that overflow.
   - The bitwise OR (`|`) combines these two results.
4. **Masking**: We use `& 0xFFFFFFFF` to ensure that the result remains a 32-bit number, effectively discarding any bits beyond the 32nd bit.

This function will correctly rotate the bits of a 32-bit integer to the left by the specified number of bits.",0.00024255,5.849744081497192,,True,

1. **Understand the Rotation**: Rotating a binary string means moving the last character to the front. For example, rotating ""011001"" once gives ""101100"".

2. **Convert to Integer**: After each rotation, we need to convert the binary string to an integer and check if it is odd.

2. We iterate through the array starting from the second element.
3. If the current element is negative, we swap `max_product` and `min_product` because multiplying by a negative number will turn the maximum into a minimum and vice versa.

A polite number is a positive integer that can be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers. Notably, all positive integers except powers of 2 are polite numbers.

Here's how we can implement a function to find the nth polite number:

1. We will iterate through positive integers.
2. We will skip powers of 2.
3. We will count the polite numbers until we reach the nth one.

Here is the Python code to achieve this:

```python
def is_power_of_two(n):

This algorithm not only finds the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two integers \( a \) and \( b \) but also provides a way to express this gcd as a linear combination of \( a \) and \( b \).

Here's how we can implement the function `find_solution`:

1. First, we need to check if a solution exists. A solution exists if and only if the gcd of \( a \) and \( b \) divides \( n \).
2. If a solution exists, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find one particular solution \( (x_0, y_0) \).
3. We can then adjust this solution to find all possible integer solutions.

### Explanation:
- We use a nested loop to iterate through all pairs of tuples in the input list.

mbpp,Mbpp/735,TrustRoute-NoCost,1,"To toggle the bits of a number except for the first and the last bit, we can follow these steps:

1. Convert the number to its binary representation.
2. Identify the positions of the first and last bits.
3. Toggle the bits in between the first and last bits.
4. Convert the modified binary representation back to a decimal number.

Here's the implementation of the `toggle_middle_bits` function:

3. We check if the current element is a tuple using `isinstance(element, tuple)`.

\[ f(n) = \max(f(n/2) + f(n/3) + f(n/4) + f(n/5), n) \]

This means that for a given `n`, we can either take the sum of the function evaluated at `n/2`, `n/3`, `n/4`, and `n/5`, or we can take `n` itself, whichever is larger.

We can use recursion along with memoization to optimize the function and avoid recalculating values for the same `n`. Here's how we can implement this:

```python
def get_max_sum(n, memo=None):
    if memo is None:

### Explanation:
1. **Memoization**: We use a dictionary `memo` to store results of previously computed values of `f(n)` to avoid redundant calculations.
2. **Base Case**: If `n` is 0, the maximum sum is 0.
3. **Recursive Calculation**: We compute the maximum sum by evaluating the function recursively for `n/2`, `n/3`, `n/4`, and `n/5`, and then taking the maximum of that sum and `n`.
4. **Assertion**: Finally, we test the function with the assertion provided to ensure it works correctly.

mbpp,Mbpp/6,TrustRoute-NoCost,1,"You can determine if two numbers differ at exactly one bit position by using the XOR operation. When you XOR two numbers, the result will have bits set to `1` where the corresponding bits of the two numbers differ. If the result has exactly one bit set to `1`, then the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position.

Here's a Python function that implements this logic:

### Explanation:
1. **Counting Occurrences**: We first create a dictionary `num_count` to count how many times each number appears in the input list.
2. **Finding Pairs**: For each number in the list, we calculate its complement (the number that, when added to it, equals the target sum). We check how many times this complement appears in the dictionary.
3. **Adjusting Count**: If the number and its complement are the same, we subtract one from the count to avoid counting the same pair twice.
4. **Final Count**: Since each pair is counted twice (once for each order), we divide the total count by 2 before returning it.

### Explanation:
1. **Input Length Check**: First, we check if the lengths of the two arrays are the same. If not, they cannot follow the same pattern.
2. **Mapping Creation**: We use two dictionaries:
   - `pattern_to_value` to map each unique pattern to its corresponding value.
   - `value_to_pattern` to ensure that each value maps back to its corresponding pattern.
3. **Iteration**: We iterate through both arrays simultaneously using `zip()`. For each pair of pattern and value:
   - We check if the pattern has already been mapped. If it has, we verify that it maps to the same value.
   - We do the same check for the value to ensure it maps back to the same pattern.
4. **Return Result**: If all checks pass, we return `True`, indicating that the two arrays follow the same pattern. If any check fails, we return `False`.

Here's how we can approach the problem step by step:

1. **Kadane's Algorithm**: This algorithm helps us find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in a single pass through the array.

2. **Handling Repeats**: Since the array is repeated `k` times, we need to consider the maximum subarray that might span across the boundaries of the repeated arrays. This means we need to consider:
   - The maximum subarray sum within a single instance of the array.
   - The maximum subarray sum that includes elements from the end of one instance and the beginning of another.

3. **Edge Cases**: If `k` is 1, we simply apply Kadane's algorithm to the original array.

Here’s the implementation of the function:

mbpp,Mbpp/300,TrustRoute-NoCost,1,"To solve the problem of counting binary sequences of length \(2n\) such that the sum of the first \(n\) bits is equal to the sum of the last \(n\) bits, we can use combinatorial reasoning.

For a binary sequence of length \(2n\), each bit can either be 0 or 1. The sum of the first \(n\) bits can range from 0 to \(n\), and the same applies to the last \(n\) bits. To satisfy the condition that the sums are equal, we need to count the number of ways to choose \(k\) bits to be 1 in the first half and the same number \(k\) in the second half.

The number of ways to choose \(k\) bits to be 1 in \(n\) bits is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{n}{k}\). Therefore, the total number of valid sequences can be calculated by summing the squares of the binomial coefficients for all possible values of \(k\) from 0 to \(n\):

\[
\text{Total Count} = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k}^2
\]

This sum can be computed using the identity that relates it to the central binomial coefficient:

\[
\sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k}^2 = \binom{2n}{n}
\]

Thus, the count of valid binary sequences of length \(2n\) is given by \(\binom{2n}{n}\).

mbpp,Mbpp/123,TrustRoute-NoCost,1,"To solve the problem of summing all amicable numbers from 1 to a specified number, we first need to understand what amicable numbers are. Two numbers are considered amicable if the sum of the proper divisors (excluding the number itself) of the first number equals the second number, and vice versa.

Here's how we can implement the function `amicable_numbers_sum`:

1. Create a helper function to calculate the sum of proper divisors of a number.
2. Iterate through numbers from 1 to the specified limit.
3. For each number, check if it forms an amicable pair with another number.
4. Keep track of amicable numbers to avoid counting them multiple times.
5. Return the sum of all unique amicable numbers found.

Here is the implementation:

```python
def sum_of_proper_divisors(n):
    """"""Return the sum of proper divisors of n.""""""
    if n < 2:
        return 0
    total = 1  # Start with 1, since it's a proper divisor of any n > 1
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            total += i
            if i != n // i:  # Add the complementary divisor if it's different
                total += n // i
    return total

def amicable_numbers_sum(limit):
    """"""Return the sum of all amicable numbers from 1 to limit.""""""
    amicable_numbers = set()
    
    for num in range(1, limit + 1):
        if num not in amicable_numbers:  # Only check if num is not already found
            partner = sum_of_proper_divisors(num)
            if partner != num and sum_of_proper_divisors(partner) == num:
                amicable_numbers.add(num)
                amicable_numbers.add(partner)
    
    return sum(amicable_numbers)

# Test the function with the provided assertion
assert amicable_numbers_sum(999) == 504
```

### Explanation:
- The `sum_of_proper_divisors` function calculates the sum of all proper divisors of a given number.
- The `amicable_numbers_sum` function iterates through all numbers up to the specified limit, checking for amicable pairs and adding them to a set to ensure uniqueness.
- Finally, it returns the sum of all unique amicable numbers found within the specified range.

### Explanation:
- The function `tuple_to_dict` takes a tuple as input.
- It uses a dictionary comprehension to iterate through the tuple with a step of 2, treating each pair of adjacent elements as a key-value pair.
- The `range(0, len(tup) - 1, 2)` generates indices for the keys, and `tup[i + 1]` accesses the corresponding value.
- Finally, the function returns the constructed dictionary.
