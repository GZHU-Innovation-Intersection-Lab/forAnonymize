1. **Weight of Chocolate Bars:**
   - There are 25 chocolate bars.
   - Each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams.
   - Total weight of chocolate bars = Number of chocolate bars × Weight of each chocolate bar
   \[

gsm8k,gsm8k-211,TrustRoute-NoRep,1,"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The number of white chickens is two more than the number of red chickens:
   \[
   w = r + 2
   \]

2. The total number of eggs collected from both types of chickens is 42 eggs per day. The red chickens produce 3 eggs each, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs each:
   \[
   3r + 5w = 42
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( w \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[
3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
\]

Expanding this equation gives:

\[
3r + 5r + 10 = 42
\]

Combining like terms results in:

\[
8r + 10 = 42
\]

Next, we will isolate \( r \) by subtracting 10 from both sides:

\[
8r = 32
\]

Now, divide both sides by 8:

\[
r = 4
\]

Now that we have the number of red chickens, we can find the number of white chickens using the first equation:

\[
w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6
\]

Thus, Jerry has:

- Red chickens: \( 4 \)
- White chickens: \( 6 \)

To verify, we can check the total number of eggs produced:

- Eggs from red chickens: \( 4 \times 3 = 12 \)
- Eggs from white chickens: \( 6 \times 5 = 30 \)

Total eggs:

\[
12 + 30 = 42

\[
\text{Water lost} = 4 \text{ gallons/minute} \times 4 \text{ minutes} = 16 \text{ gallons}

1. **Base burrito cost**: $6.50
2. **Extra meat**: $2.00
3. **Extra cheese**: $1.00
4. **Avocado**: $1.00
5. **Sauces**: 2 sauces at $0.25 each = 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
6. **Upgrade for chips and drink**: $3.00

Now, let's add these costs together:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 6.50 + 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 + 3.00
\]

Calculating this step by step:

- \(6.50 + 2.00 = 8.50\)
- \(8.50 + 1.00 = 9.50\)
- \(9.50 + 1.00 = 10.50\)
- \(10.50 + 0.50 = 11.00\)
- \(11.00 + 3.00 = 14.00\)

1. **First bag**: 
   - The first bag has 300 M&Ms.

2. **Second bag**: 
   - The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag.
   - So, the number of M&Ms in the second bag is:
     \[

   \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
   \[

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation. 

Substituting \( R \) in the second equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
\]

Now, simplify the right side:

1. **Calculate the total rice consumed per meal:**
   Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Therefore, for 5 members:
   \[
   \text{Total rice per meal} = 5 \text{ members} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/member} = 1 \text{ kg/meal}

gsm8k,gsm8k-313,TrustRoute-NoRep,1,"Let's denote Noah's current age as \( N \) and Cera's current age as \( C \). We know from the problem that:

- Cera's current age \( C = 46 \).
- Six years ago, Cera's age was \( 46 - 6 = 40 \).
- Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah's age six years ago was \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).
- Therefore, Noah's current age is \( 20 + 6 = 26 \).

Now, we need to find the population of Chile six years ago. According to the problem, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time:

\[
\text{Population six years ago} = 3000 \times 20 = 60000.
\]

Next, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now. Let \( P \) be the current population of Chile. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{P}{2} = 60000.
\]

To find \( P \), we multiply both sides by 2:

\[
P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000.
\]

Thus, the current population of Chile is:

\[
\boxed{120000}.

gsm8k,gsm8k-314,TrustRoute-NoRep,1,"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( d \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is \( 2d \) (twice as many as on defense).
- The number of players on special teams is \( \frac{d}{2} \) (half the number of players on defense).

Now, we can set up an equation based on the total number of team members:

\[
d + 2d + \frac{d}{2} = 105
\]

Combining the terms on the left side:

\[
3d + \frac{d}{2} = 105
\]

To combine \( 3d \) and \( \frac{d}{2} \), we can convert \( 3d \) into a fraction with a denominator of 2:

\[
3d = \frac{6d}{2}
\]

Now we can rewrite the equation:

\[
\frac{6d}{2} + \frac{d}{2} = 105
\]

Combining the fractions:

\[
\frac{6d + d}{2} = 105
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{7d}{2} = 105
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 2:

\[
7d = 210
\]

Now, divide both sides by 7:

\[
d = 30
\]

Thus, the number of players on the defense is \( \boxed{30} \). 

To verify:
- Offense: \( 2d = 2 \times 30 = 60 \)
- Special teams: \( \frac{d}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \)

Adding these together:

\[
30 + 60 + 15 = 105

Let the number of popsicles that Betty has be \( 5x \) and the number of popsicles that Sam has be \( 6x \), where \( x \) is a common multiplier.

According to the problem, the total number of popsicles they have together is 165. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

   - Daily energy consumption = 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watts.

2. **Convert daily energy consumption to kilowatts**:
   - Since 1 kilowatt = 1000 watts, we convert 7200 watts to kilowatts:

1. **Calculate the cost of the fireworks:**
   - The first package costs $400.
   - The second package costs twice that amount: \( 2 \times 400 = 800 \).

2. **Calculate the total cost before the discount:**
   - Total cost before discount = Cost of first package + Cost of second package
   - Total cost before discount = \( 400 + 800 = 1200 \).

3. **Calculate the discount:**
   - Tim gets a 20% discount on the total cost.
   - Discount = \( 20\% \) of \( 1200 = 0.20 \times 1200 = 240 \).

4. **Calculate the total cost after the discount:**
   - Total cost after discount = Total cost before discount - Discount
   - Total cost after discount = \( 1200 - 240 = 960 \).

5. **Add the cost of the finale firework:**
   - The finale firework costs $150.

From the problem, we know the following:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- She gathers half of that from the shortest trees, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
- Therefore, the total number of apples Joanne gathers is:
  \[
  30 + 15 + x = 45 + x
  \]

Now, let's analyze how many apples her sister gathers:

- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- She gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- Her sister does not gather any apples from the average trees.

Thus, the total number of apples her sister gathers is:
\[

Let:
- \( c \) = number of camels
- \( d \) = number of dromedaries

From the problem, we have the following two equations:

1. The total number of heads (which is the total number of animals):
   \[
   c + d = 180
   \]

2. The total number of bumps (camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump):
   \[

Now we can solve this system of equations.

First, we can solve the first equation for \( d \):

1. **Distance traveled in the first 4 days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day for 4 days.
   - Distance = 200 km/day * 4 days = 800 kilometers.

2. **Distance traveled in the next 2 days:**
   - He traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days.
   - 30% of 800 kilometers = 0.30 * 800 km = 240 kilometers.
   - This distance is spread over 2 days, but we only need the total for this part, which is 240 kilometers.

3. **Distance traveled on the next day:**

1. **Determine the amount of gasoline in each container**:
   - Total gallons of gas = 15 gallons
   - Number of containers = 5
   - Gasoline per container = Total gallons / Number of containers
   \[
   \text{Gasoline per container} = \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount of gasoline Josey needed**:

1. **Total Money Spent**: George spent $5. Since he had 1% of his money left, we can calculate how much that is:
   \[
   1\% \text{ of } 5 = 0.01 \times 5 = 0.05 \text{ dollars (or 5 cents)}
   \]
   Therefore, the amount of money he actually spent is:
   \[
   5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \text{ dollars}

2. **Cost of Chips**: Each bag of chips costs 40 cents (or $0.40). George bought 3 bags of chips, so the total cost for the chips is:
   \[
   3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Remaining Money After Chips**: After buying the chips, the amount of money George has left is:
   \[

gsm8k,gsm8k-500,TrustRoute-NoRep,1,"Let's denote the number of insects found by Lily as \( L \), the number found by David as \( D \), and the number found by Bodhi as \( B \).

From the problem, we have the following equations:

1. \( L + D + B = 43 \) (the total number of insects)
2. \( L = D + 7 \) (Lily found 7 more than David)
3. \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \) (David found half of what Bodhi found)

Now, we can substitute \( D \) from equation 3 into equations 1 and 2.

Substituting \( D \) into equation 2:

\[
L = \frac{1}{2}B + 7
\]

Now substituting \( D \) into equation 1:

\[
L + \frac{1}{2}B + B = 43
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
L + \frac{3}{2}B = 43
\]

Now we can substitute \( L \) from the modified equation 2 into this equation:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}B + 7\right) + \frac{3}{2}B = 43
\]

Combining like terms:

\[
\frac{1}{2}B + \frac{3}{2}B + 7 = 43
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2B + 7 = 43
\]

Subtracting 7 from both sides:

\[
2B = 36
\]

Dividing by 2:

\[
B = 18
\]

Now that we have \( B \), we can find \( D \):

\[
D = \frac{1}{2}B = \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9
\]

Finally, we can find \( L \):

\[
L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16
\]

Thus, the number of insects that Lily found is \( \boxed{16} \).",0.00284355,8.303088188171387,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,,1

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas. Since she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can express the number of chairs Ophelia has as:
   \[
   O_c = 20 + 2 = 22
   \]

2. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia:
   \[
   J_c = 3 \times O_c = 3 \times 22 = 66

2. **Cousin's Age in 8 Years**: 
   Let Jame's cousin's current age be \( x \). In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be:

3. For the **last two teeth** (teeth 5 and 6), the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as she had received for each of the previous three teeth. Since Sharon received **$1.00** for each of the last three teeth, half of that is:

   \]
   Therefore, for these two teeth:
   \[

According to the problem:

1. Richie scored 80 goals.
2. Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark:
   \[
   80 = M + 20
   \]
   From this, we can solve for \( M \):
   \[
   M = 80 - 20 = 60
   \]

3. Richie also scored 45 more goals than Anna:
   \[
   80 = A + 45

1. **Total Money Available**: Peter has $70.

2. **Days of Spending**: He plans to spend money from Sunday through Saturday, which is a total of 7 days.

3. **Daily Spending**: Since he wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week, we divide his total money by the number of days:
   \[

gsm8k,gsm8k-593,TrustRoute-NoRep,1,"To determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, we can model the height of the beanstalk over time.

1. **Initial height of the beanstalk**: 4 feet
2. **Height of Mark's window**: 20 feet
3. **Growth pattern**: The beanstalk doubles its height every day.

We can express the height of the beanstalk after \( n \) days with the formula:

\[
\text{Height after } n \text{ days} = 4 \times 2^n
\]

We want to find the smallest \( n \) such that:

\[
4 \times 2^n > 20
\]

To simplify this inequality, we can divide both sides by 4:

\[
2^n > 5
\]

Next, we can find the smallest integer \( n \) that satisfies this inequality. We can calculate powers of 2:

- \( 2^0 = 1 \)
- \( 2^1 = 2 \)
- \( 2^2 = 4 \)
- \( 2^3 = 8 \)

We see that \( 2^3 = 8 \) is the first power of 2 that is greater than 5. Therefore, \( n = 3 \) is the smallest integer satisfying the inequality.

   - Therefore, the protein content per gram of mushrooms is:
     \[
     \text{Protein per gram} = \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}} = 0.03 \text{ grams of protein per gram of mushrooms}

We know the following:
1. Each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs.

From the problem, we can set up the following equations based on the information given:

   \[
   4s + 2g = 70

2. The total number of heads:
   \[
   s + g = 20

Now, we can solve these equations step by step.

First, we can solve the second equation for \( g \):
\[
g = 20 - s
\]

Next, we substitute \( g \) in the first equation:

James delivers a total of 600 newspapers, and we know he delivers:
- 198 newspapers to District A
- 209 newspapers to District C

Let \( x \) be the number of newspapers delivered to District B. The equation can be set up as follows:

\[
198 + x + 209 = 600
\]

Now, we can combine the known quantities:

\[
198 + 209 = 407

From the problem, we know the following:

1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet. Let's assume \( T_1 = R_1 + 7 \).
2. The combined ages of the twins and triplets is 44: 
   \[
   T_1 + T_2 + R_1 + R_2 + R_3 = 44
   \]
3. Since the twins are the same age, we can say \( T_1 = T_2 \).

Let \( T \) represent the age of each twin. Therefore, we can rewrite the equations as follows:

1. \( T = R_1 + 7 \)
2. The combined age equation becomes:
   \[
   T + T + R_1 + R_2 + R_3 = 44
   \]
   which simplifies to:
   \[
   2T + R_1 + R_2 + R_3 = 44
   \]

Now, since the triplets are the same age, we can denote their age as \( R \). Thus, \( R_1 = R_2 = R_3 = R \).

Substituting \( R_1 \), \( R_2 \), and \( R_3 \) into the equation gives us:
\[
2T + 3R = 44
\]

Now, we can substitute \( T \) from the first equation into this equation:
\[
2(R_1 + 7) + 3R = 44
\]
Substituting \( R_1 \) with \( R \):
\[
2(R + 7) + 3R = 44
\]
Expanding this:
\[
2R + 14 + 3R = 44
\]
Combining like terms:
\[
5R + 14 = 44
\]
Subtracting 14 from both sides:
\[
5R = 30
\]
Dividing by 5:
\[
R = 6
\]

Now, substituting \( R \) back to find \( T \):
\[
T = R + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13

gsm8k,gsm8k-711,TrustRoute-NoRep,1,"To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can buy with $6.00 under the deal of ""buy 2 scoops, get 1 free,"" we can follow these steps:

1. **Cost of Scoops**: Each scoop costs $1.50.
2. **Deal Structure**: For every 2 scoops purchased, Erin gets 1 additional scoop for free.

Now, let's calculate how many scoops Erin can buy:

- With $6.00, we first find out how many scoops she can buy without considering the deal:
  \[
  \text{Number of scoops without deal} = \frac{6.00}{1.50} = 4 \text{ scoops}
  \]

- Now, we apply the deal:
  - If Erin buys 2 scoops, she pays:
    \[
    2 \text{ scoops} \times 1.50 = 3.00 \text{ dollars}
    \]
    She then gets 1 additional scoop for free, totaling:
    \[
    2 + 1 = 3 \text{ scoops}
    \]

- With $6.00, Erin can repeat this process:
  - If she spends another $3.00 (for another 2 scoops), she gets another free scoop:
    \[
    2 \text{ scoops} \times 1.50 = 3.00 \text{ dollars}
    \]
    Again, she gets 1 additional scoop for free, totaling:
    \[
    2 + 1 = 3 \text{ scoops}
    \]

- Therefore, in total, Erin can buy:
  \[
  3 \text{ scoops} + 3 \text{ scoops} = 6 \text{ scoops}
  \]

Thus, with $6.00, Erin should buy **6 scoops of ice cream**.",0.00317325,8.8749418258667,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,,1

- 4 inches

So, the total length of Topher's shoe in inches is:
\[ 
96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} 
\]

Next, we know from the problem that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby’s shoes. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

Let \( b \) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. Then we can write:

\]

We know that the length of Topher's shoe is 100 inches, so we can set up the equation:

2. **French Book**: 
   - This book weighs 4 pounds.

3. **English Book**: 
   - This book weighs 3 pounds.

4. **History Book**: 
   - The history book weighs twice as much as the English book. Since the English book weighs 3 pounds, the history book weighs:
     \[
     \text{Weight of history book} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ pounds}

1. **Initial Stickers**:
   - Small stickers: 30
   - Large stickers: 40

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons**:
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers:
     \[
     90\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.9 \times 30 = 27 \text{ small stickers}
     \]
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so:
     \[

     \]
   - After this trade, Lorraine has:
     - Small stickers left: 
     \[
     30 - 27 = 3 \text{ small stickers}
     \]
     - Large stickers: 40
     - Large buttons: 9

3. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons**:
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers:
     \[
     50\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.5 \times 40 = 20 \text{ large stickers}
     \]
   - Each large sticker is worth 1 large button, so:
     \[
     \text{Large buttons received} = 20 \text{ large buttons}
     \]
   - After this trade, Lorraine has:
     - Small stickers: 3
     - Large stickers left: 
     \[
     40 - 20 = 20 \text{ large stickers}
     \]
     - Large buttons: 
     \[
     9 + 20 = 29 \text{ large buttons}
     \]

4. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons**:
   - Lorraine trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons:
   - Each large button is worth 3 small stickers, so:
     \[
     \text{Small buttons received} = 20 \text{ large stickers} \times 3 = 60 \text{ small buttons}

   - After this trade, Lorraine has:
     - Small stickers: 3
     - Large stickers: 0
     - Large buttons: 29
     - Small buttons: 60

5. **Total Buttons**:

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The first house needs half of the second house:
   \[
   x = \frac{1}{2}y
   \]

2. The third house needs double the first house:
   \[
   z = 2x
   \]

3. The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250:
   \[
   x + y + z = 250
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( x \) and \( z \) in terms of \( y \) into the total equation.

First, substitute \( x \) into the equation for \( z \):
\[
z = 2x = 2\left(\frac{1}{2}y\right) = y
\]

Now, substitute \( x \) and \( z \) into the total equation:
\[
x + y + z = 250
\]
\[
\frac{1}{2}y + y + y = 250
\]

Combine the terms:
\[
\frac{1}{2}y + 2y = 250
\]
\[
\frac{1}{2}y + \frac{4}{2}y = 250
\]
\[
\frac{5}{2}y = 250

Now, solve for \( y \):
\[
y = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} = 100

gsm8k,gsm8k-779,TrustRoute-NoRep,1,"To find out how far the Llesis family's vacation spot is, we can break down the problem into two parts: the driving distance and the hiking distance.

1. **Driving Speed**: The family drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.

2. **Hiking Speed**: The hiking speed is given as 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. 
   - Half of the driving speed: \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) miles per hour.
   - Therefore, the hiking speed: \( 25 - 5 = 20 \) miles per hour.

3. **Time Spent Hiking**: It took them 1.5 hours to hike.

4. **Distance Hiked**: We can calculate the distance they hiked using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   So, the distance hiked is:
   \[
   \text{Distance hiked} = 20 \text{ miles/hour} \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Total Time**: The total time for the trip was 6 hours, and they spent 1.5 hours hiking. Therefore, the time spent driving is:
   \[
   \text{Time driving} = 6 \text{ hours} - 1.5 \text{ hours} = 4.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

6. **Distance Driven**: We can calculate the distance they drove using the same distance formula:
   \[
   \text{Distance driven} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   So, the distance driven is:
   \[
   \text{Distance driven} = 50 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4.5 \text{ hours} = 225 \text{ miles}
   \]

7. **Total Distance to Vacation Spot**: The total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance driven} + \text{Distance hiked} = 225 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 255 \text{ miles}

gsm8k,gsm8k-780,TrustRoute-NoRep,1,"Let's define the variables for Ava and Emma's scores based on the information given:

- Let \( e \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- Let \( b \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
- Let \( t \) be the time (in seconds) Emma has left when she finishes the level.

From the problem, we know the following:

1. Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma:
   \[
   \text{Enemies Ava jumps on} = e + 8
   \]

2. Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma:
   \[
   \text{Berries Ava collects} = b + 3
   \]

3. Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma:
   \[
   \text{Time Ava has left} = t - 4
   \]

Now we can calculate the scores for both Ava and Emma using the scoring rules:

- The score for Emma:
  \[
  \text{Score}_{\text{Emma}} = 10e + 5b + 30t
  \]

- The score for Ava:
  \[
  \text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10(e + 8) + 5(b + 3) + 30(t - 4)
  \]

Now, let's simplify Ava's score:

\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10e + 80 + 5b + 15 + 30t - 120
\]
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10e + 5b + 30t + 80 + 15 - 120
\]
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10e + 5b + 30t - 25
\]

Now we have both scores:

- Score for Emma:
  \[
  \text{Score}_{\text{Emma}} = 10e + 5b + 30t
  \]

- Score for Ava:
  \[
  \text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10e + 5b + 30t - 25
  \]

Next, we find the difference between their scores:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} - \text{Score}_{\text{Emma}}
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = (10e + 5b + 30t - 25) - (10e + 5b + 30t)
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = -25
\]

Thus, the difference between Ava's and Emma's scores is \(-25\). This means Ava's score is 25 points lower than Emma's score. 

**Final Answer: The difference between their two scores is 25 points, with Emma winning.**",0.00460025,12.073076009750366,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,,1

   - Third graders: 340 out of 500 passed.
   - Fourth graders: 40 out of 100 passed.
   - Fifth graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders.

   First, we calculate the pass rate for the fourth graders:
   \[
   \text{Pass rate for fourth graders} = \frac{40}{100} = 0.4 \text{ (or 40%)}

- Since she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \).
- She uses twice as much oil as salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2s \).

1. Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so we can express Smendrick's cards as:
   \[
   s = 3p
   \]

2. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, which can be expressed as:
   \[
   b = s + 12 = 3p + 12
   \]

3. The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   b + s + p = 341
   \]

Now, substituting the expressions for \( b \) and \( s \) in terms of \( p \) into the total equation:
\[
(3p + 12) + (3p) + p = 341
\]

Combining like terms:
\[
3p + 12 + 3p + p = 341
\]
\[
7p + 12 = 341
\]

Next, we subtract 12 from both sides:
\[
7p = 341 - 12
\]
\[
7p = 329
\]

Now, divide both sides by 7 to find \( p \):
\[
p = \frac{329}{7} = 47

Now that we have \( p \), we can find \( s \) and \( b \):
\[
s = 3p = 3 \times 47 = 141

\[
b = s + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153

- Your mom's age will be \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \) (since her age is one less than three times your brother's age).

Now, we can set up the equation for the sum of all ages:

2. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne:
   \[
   S = A + 25

3. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn:
   \[
   A = F - 12

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) into the total books equation.

First, substitute \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[
S = (F - 12) + 25
\]
This simplifies to:
\[

- \( S = F + 13 \)

Now substitute these into the total books equation:

The information about Kamala and Alba tells us the *frequency* of mowing, but it doesn't tell us how much they *paid* Tasha. Since we don't know their payment rates or how many times Joe's lawn was actually mowed, we cannot calculate any additional income from mowing besides what Joe paid.

Therefore, the only concrete income from mowing that we know of is the $6 from Joe.

   \[
   \text{Remaining cups} = \text{Total cups} - \text{Cinnamon tea cups} = 27 - 15 = 12 \text{ cups}

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + A + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   A = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's ages:
   \[
   P = A + J
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( P \) into the first equation.

First, substitute \( A = J + 10 \) into the equation for \( P \):
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now substitute \( P \) and \( A \) into the combined age equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[

\]

Now, solve for \( J \):
\[
4J = 100 - 20
\]
\[

\[
J = 20

Now that we have \( J \), we can find \( A \) (Paul's age):

gsm8k,gsm8k-944,TrustRoute-NoRep,1,"To calculate how much Jen will earn from selling her root crops, we need to find the total earnings from each type of crop and then sum them up.

1. **Yams**: 
   - Number of yams = 6
   - Price per yam = $1.5
   - Total earnings from yams = 6 yams * $1.5/yam = $9.00

2. **Sweet Potatoes**: 
   - Number of sweet potatoes = 10

gsm8k,gsm8k-950,TrustRoute-NoRep,1,"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. The total points scored by all three is 45:
   \[
   B + A + D = 45
   \]

2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo:
   \[
   B = A + 20
   \]

3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar:
   \[
   B = D + 10
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( B \) from the second and third equations into the first equation.

Substituting \( B = A + 20 \) into the total points equation:
\[
(A + 20) + A + D = 45
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2A + D + 20 = 45
\]
Subtracting 20 from both sides gives:
\[
2A + D = 25 \quad \text{(1)}
\]

Next, substituting \( B = D + 10 \) into the total points equation:
\[
(D + 10) + A + D = 45
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
A + 2D + 10 = 45
\]
Subtracting 10 from both sides gives:
\[
A + 2D = 35 \quad \text{(2)}
\]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( 2A + D = 25 \)
2. \( A + 2D = 35 \)

We can solve this system. From equation (1), we can express \( D \) in terms of \( A \):
\[
D = 25 - 2A \quad \text{(3)}
\]

Now, substitute equation (3) into equation (2):
\[
A + 2(25 - 2A) = 35
\]
Expanding this gives:
\[
A + 50 - 4A = 35
\]
Combining like terms results in:
\[
-3A + 50 = 35
\]
Subtracting 50 from both sides gives:
\[
-3A = -15
\]
Dividing by -3 yields:
\[
A = 5
\]

Now that we have \( A \), we can find \( D \) using equation (3):
\[
D = 25 - 2(5) = 25 - 10 = 15
\]

Finally, we can find \( B \) using \( B = A + 20 \):
\[
B = 5 + 20 = 25

- Azibo: 5 points
- Dinar: 15 points

3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times what Adelwolfe has caught:

Now we can substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( S \) into the total equation.

First, substitute \( A \) into the total equation:
\[

\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2S + D + 5 = 339
\]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[

\]

Next, substitute \( S \) from the third equation into this equation:
\[

Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, we can determine the timeline of events:

1. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
2. The next time the comet appears, Bill's dad will be \( 30 + 75 = 105 \) years old.
3. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw it the first time. Therefore, when Bill's dad was 30, Bill's age at that time is \( x \).

gsm8k,gsm8k-994,TrustRoute-NoRep,1,"Let's break down the howling times for each wolf step by step.

1. **Tobias's Howl:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's Howl:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Therefore, Chikote's howl = \( 2 \times 20 \) seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous's Howl:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - The combined length of Tobias's and Chikote's howls = \( 20 + 40 \) seconds = 60 seconds.
   - Therefore, Igneous's howl = 60 seconds.

Now, we can find the total time of howls for all three wolves:

\[
\text{Total howl time} = \text{Tobias's howl} + \text{Chikote's howl} + \text{Igneous's howl}
\]
\[
\text{Total howl time} = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 \text{ seconds}
\]

Next, we convert the total howl time from seconds to minutes:

\[
\text{Total howl time in minutes} = \frac{120 \text{ seconds}}{60 \text{ seconds per minute}} = 2 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is \( \boxed{2} \) minutes.",0.00194545,7.701842546463013,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,,1

- Akbar's age = \( A = 3 \)
- Alessandro's age = \( B = 4 \)
- Helene's age = \( C \)

According to the problem, the total age of the children is 20:

\[
A + B + C + D = 20
\]

Substituting the known ages of Akbar and Alessandro:

\[
3 + 4 + C + D = 20
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
C + D = 20 - 7 = 13

Next, we know that Helene's age is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the four children is given by:

\[

Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

Now, we can set up the equation for the total earnings from the sales:

\[
\text{Total earnings} = (\text{Number of large stuffed animals} \times \text{Price of large stuffed animals}) + (\text{Number of small stuffed animals} \times \text{Price of small stuffed animals})

1. **Probability of having a substitute teacher (who won't collect homework)**: 50% (or 0.5)
   - If there is a substitute, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.

2. **Probability of having the normal teacher (who might give an extension)**: 50% (or 0.5)
   - If the normal teacher is present, there are two scenarios:
     - **Probability of getting an extension for the whole class**: 40% (or 0.4)
       - If the whole class gets an extension, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.
     - **Probability of not getting an extension for the whole class**: 60% (or 0.6)
       - If the class does not get an extension, there is still a chance for Marcus to get a personal extension.
       - **Probability that Marcus convinces the teacher his dog ate his homework**: 20% (or 0.2)
         - If he convinces the teacher, he does not have to turn in his homework.
       - **Probability that Marcus does not convince the teacher**: 80% (or 0.8)
         - If he does not convince the teacher, he has to turn in his homework.

Now, let's calculate the overall probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework:

1. **If there is a substitute teacher**: 
   - Probability of having to turn in homework = 0% (because he doesn't have to turn it in).
   - Contribution to the total probability = \( 0.5 \times 0 = 0 \)

2. **If the normal teacher is present**:
   - Probability of getting an extension for the whole class = 0.4
   - Contribution to the total probability = \( 0.5 \times 0.4 \times 0 = 0 \) (no homework due)
   - Probability of not getting an extension for the whole class = 0.6
     - Probability of Marcus convincing the teacher = 0.2
     - Contribution to the total probability = \( 0.5 \times 0.6 \times 0.2 \times 0 = 0 \) (no homework due)
     - Probability of Marcus not convincing the teacher = 0.8
     - Contribution to the total probability = \( 0.5 \times 0.6 \times 0.8 \times 1 = 0.5 \times 0.6 \times 0.8 = 0.24 \)

Now, summing up all contributions where he has to turn in homework:

- Total probability of having to turn in homework = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0.24 = 0.24

Thus, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:

According to the problem:

- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.

The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is given as 19. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Now, let's simplify the equation step by step:

1. Combine the terms on the left side:
   \[
   x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
   \]

2. To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 2:
   \[
   2(2x + 4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2 \cdot 19
   \]
   This results in:
   \[
   4x + 8 + x = 38
   \]

3. Combine like terms:
   \[
   5x + 8 = 38
   \]

4. Subtract 8 from both sides:
   \[
   5x = 30
   \]

5. Divide by 5:

- Third set: \( \frac{x}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \)

- \( P_0 \) is the initial price of the car.

\[

Substituting \( H \) with \( S + 60 \):

1. **Calculate the initial height from which the ball is dropped.**
   Since Nathan drops the ball from the third-floor balcony and each story is 24 feet high, the initial height (H) is:
   \[
   H = 3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet}

2. **Calculate the height after the first bounce.**
   The ball bounces to \( \frac{2}{3} \) of its previous height after each bounce. Therefore, the height after the first bounce (H1) is:
   \[
   H1 = H \times \frac{2}{3} = 72 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet}

According to the problem, if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \). Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
x + 24 = 60
\]

Now, we can solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 60 - 24
\]
\[
x = 36
\]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles.

Next, we need to find out how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 marbles. We can calculate this as follows:

gsm8k,gsm8k-1137,TrustRoute-NoRep,1,"To determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug, we can set up an equation based on the concept of mixing temperatures.

Let \( T \) be the temperature of the water in the second mug (in degrees).

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the total volume of water in the bottle is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) ounces.

The total heat content of the water in the bottle can be calculated as follows:

1. The heat content from the 33-degree mug:
   \[
   \text{Heat from 33-degree mug} = 4 \, \text{ounces} \times 33 \, \text{degrees} = 132 \, \text{ounce-degrees}
   \]

2. The heat content from the second mug:
   \[
   \text{Heat from second mug} = 1 \, \text{ounce} \times T \, \text{degrees} = T \, \text{ounce-degrees}
   \]

The total heat content in the water bottle is:
\[
132 + T \, \text{ounce-degrees}
\]

The average temperature of the mixture in the water bottle can be calculated as:
\[
\text{Average temperature} = \frac{\text{Total heat content}}{\text{Total volume}} = \frac{132 + T}{5}
\]

For Donny to be able to drink the water, this average temperature must be at least 40 degrees:
\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Now, we can solve this inequality:

1. Multiply both sides by 5:
   \[
   132 + T \geq 200
   \]

2. Subtract 132 from both sides:
   \[
   T \geq 200 - 132
   \]
   \[
   T \geq 68
   \]

Thus, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug must be at least **68 degrees** for Donny to be able to drink the water.",0.00308625,11.265843152999878,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,,1

1. **Calculate the number of sunflowers sold from the sunflower sales:**
   - The price of each sunflower is $2.
   - Faraday earned $26 from selling sunflowers.
   - The number of sunflowers sold can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Number of sunflowers} = \frac{\text{Total earnings from sunflowers}}{\text{Price per sunflower}} = \frac{26}{2} = 13
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of sunflowers sold from the bouquet sales:**
   - The price of each bouquet is $8.
   - Faraday earned $56 from selling bouquets.
   - The number of bouquets sold can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Number of bouquets} = \frac{\text{Total earnings from bouquets}}{\text{Price per bouquet}} = \frac{56}{8} = 7
     \]
   - Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers from the bouquets is:
     \[
     \text{Number of sunflowers from bouquets} = \text{Number of bouquets} \times 12 = 7 \times 12 = 84

   \]

2. **Second Ticket**: The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, we calculate the probability for the second ticket:

- Let \( r \) be the length of the red rope.
- Let \( b \) be the length of the blue rope.
- Let \( y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope:
   \[
   r = 4b
   \]

2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope:
   \[
   b = y - 7
   \]

3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters:
   \[
   r + b + y = 37
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( r \) and \( b \) into the third equation.

Substituting \( r = 4b \) into the combined length equation:
\[
4b + b + y = 37
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
5b + y = 37
\]

Next, substitute \( b = y - 7 \) into the equation \( 5b + y = 37 \):
\[
5(y - 7) + y = 37
\]
Expanding this gives:
\[
5y - 35 + y = 37

Combining like terms results in:

Adding 35 to both sides:

2. **Amount Given to Their Sister**:
   - Let \( x \) be the amount of money that both Ronnie and Rissa gave to their little sister.

3. **Rissa's Remaining Money**:
   - After giving \( x \) dollars to her sister, Rissa has:

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now:
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7)
   \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now:
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
   \]

Now we can solve these equations step by step.

### Step 1: Expand the first equation
From the first equation:
\[
W = 5(C + 7) = 5C + 35
\]

### Step 2: Substitute \( W \) in the second equation
Now we substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35)
\]

### Step 3: Clear the fraction
Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5C + 35
\]
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

### Step 4: Rearrange the equation
Now, rearranging gives:
\[
75 - 35 = 5C - 3C
\]
\[
40 = 2C
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( C \)
Dividing both sides by 2:
\[
C = 20
\]

### Conclusion
Colin is currently \( \boxed{20} \) years old.

### Verification
To verify, we can find Wendy's age:
Using \( C = 20 \) in the first equation:
\[
W = 5(C + 7) = 5(20 + 7) = 5 \times 27 = 135
\]

Now check the second condition:
In 25 years, Colin will be:

1. **Calculate the Selling Price:**
   Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them. If she bought the magazines for $72, the selling price \( S \) can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   S = \frac{11}{8} \times 72

We know from the problem that the cost of the main phone is $20. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
2x = 20
\]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 2:

1. **First 30 seconds**: 
   - Number of kernels popped = 20

2. **Next 30 seconds**: 
   - Number of kernels popped = 3 times the first amount = \(3 \times 20 = 60\)

3. **Next 30 seconds**: 
   - Popping rate increases to 4 times the initial rate (which was 20).
   - Number of kernels popped = \(4 \times 20 = 80\)

4. **Final 30 seconds**: 
   - Popping slows down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds (which was 80).
   - Number of kernels popped = \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\)

Now, let's sum up the total number of kernels popped during the cooking:

- Total popped = \(20 + 60 + 80 + 40\)

Calculating this:

\[
20 + 60 = 80

1. **Total cookies made**: 7995
2. **Rainbow cookies**: 2595
3. **Oatmeal cookies**: 3075

First, we need to add the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies together:

\[
\text{Total of rainbow and oatmeal cookies} = 2595 + 3075
\]

Calculating that:

\[

gsm8k,gsm8k-1306,TrustRoute-NoRep,1,"Let's denote the number of test tubes Igor gathered as \( T \), the number of beakers as \( B \), and the number of Petri dishes as \( P \).

According to the problem:

- Dr. Grumpus requested:
  - \( T = 16 \) (test tubes)
  - \( B = 7 \) (beakers)
  - \( P = 14 \) (Petri dishes)

However, Igor gathered:
- Half as many test tubes: 
  \[
  T = \frac{16}{2} = 8
  \]
- Two more than the number of Petri dishes requested:
  \[
  P = 14 + 2 = 16
  \]
- The number of beakers he picked up was correct, but he lost some on the way. Let \( x \) be the number of beakers Igor lost. Thus, the number of beakers on the lab bench is:
  \[
  B = 7 - x
  \]

Now, we know the total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench is 29. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[
T + (B - x) + P = 29
\]
Substituting the values we have:
\[
8 + (7 - x) + 16 = 29
\]

Now, simplify the equation:
\[
8 + 7 - x + 16 = 29
\]
\[
31 - x = 29
\]

To find \( x \), we can rearrange the equation:
\[

1. **Alexandra's amount**: 
   - Alexandra raises $430.

2. **Kim's amount**: 
   - Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra.
   - Therefore, Kim's amount = Alexandra's amount + $320 = $430 + $320 = $750.

3. **Sarah's amount**: 
   - Sarah raises $300.

4. **Maryam's amount**: 
   - Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah.

1. **Understanding the speeds**:
   - Let \( v \) be Vanessa's speed in miles per minute.
   - Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Aaron's speed is \( 2v \).

2. **Distance run**:
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles.
   - Let’s denote the distance Aaron ran as \( d_A \). According to the problem, Vanessa can run twice as far as Aaron, so:
     \[
     4 = 2d_A \implies d_A = 2 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Time taken by Aaron**:
   - We know Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. We can use his speed to find \( v \):
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \implies 16 = \frac{2}{2v}
     \]
   - Rearranging gives:
     \[
     16 = \frac{2}{2v} \implies 16 = \frac{1}{v} \implies v = \frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute}

4. **Calculating Vanessa's time**:
   - Now we can find the time it took Vanessa to run 4 miles:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{4}{v} = \frac{4}{\frac{1}{16}} = 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ minutes}

We have two equations based on the information given:

2. The total number of legs (chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs):
   \[
   2C + 4W = 70
   \]

Now, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:

\]

Now we have a system of equations:
1. \( C + W = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2W = 35 \)

Next, we can solve this system. We can subtract the first equation from the second:
