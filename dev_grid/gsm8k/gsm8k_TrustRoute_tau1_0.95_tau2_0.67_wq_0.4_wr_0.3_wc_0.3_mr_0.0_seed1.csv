1. **Calculate the total number of eggs laid per day:**  
   Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.

2. **Calculate the number of eggs she uses for breakfast and baking:**  
   - She eats 3 eggs for breakfast.
   - She uses 4 eggs for baking muffins.

1. **Calculate the total investment**: This includes the purchase price of the house and the cost of repairs.
   - Purchase price: $80,000
   - Repairs: $50,000
   - Total investment = Purchase price + Repairs = $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

2. **Calculate the increased value of the house**: The value of the house increased by 150%.

### Step 1: Calculate the total time required for the entire hike
- Average speed = Total distance / Total time
- Desired average speed = 4 miles per hour
- Total distance = 12 miles
- Total time required = Total distance / Desired average speed = 12 miles / 4 mph = 3 hours

So, Marissa needs to complete the entire 12 miles in 3 hours to achieve an average speed of 4 mph.

### Step 2: Determine the time already spent
- She walked the first 4 miles in 1 hour.
- She walked the next 2 miles in another 1 hour.
- Total time spent so far = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours
- Total distance covered so far = 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles

### Step 3: Calculate the remaining distance and time available
- Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance covered = 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles
- Time already spent = 2 hours
- Time available for the remaining distance = Total time required - Time spent = 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour

- Speed = Distance / Time
- Required speed = Remaining distance / Time available = 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour

gsm8k,gsm8k-26,TrustRoute,1,"To find out how much Mishka spent on all the clothing items, we can calculate the total cost for each type of clothing and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of shorts**:
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
   - Cost of one pair of shorts = $16.50.
   - Total cost for shorts = 3 pairs × $16.50/pair = \( 3 \times 16.50 = 49.50 \).

2. **Cost of pants**:
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
   - Cost of one pair of pants = $22.50.
   - Total cost for pants = 3 pairs × $22.50/pair = \( 3 \times 22.50 = 67.50 \).

3. **Cost of shoes**:
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
   - Cost of one pair of shoes = $42.00.
   - Total cost for shoes = 3 pairs × $42.00/pair = \( 3 \times 42.00 = 126.00 \).

Now, we can sum the total costs:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost for shorts} + \text{Total cost for pants} + \text{Total cost for shoes}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 49.50 + 67.50 + 126.00

1. The first friend guesses **80** jelly beans.

2. The second friend guesses **20 more than half the first one**:
   - Half of the first guess: \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \)
   - Adding 20: \( 40 + 20 = 60 \)
   - So, the second friend's guess is **60** jelly beans.

3. The third friend guesses **25% more than the first one**:
   - 25% of the first guess: \( 0.25 \times 80 = 20 \)

   \text{Weight from toys} = x \times \frac{1}{2}
   \]
   We set this equal to the remaining weight he needs to remove:
   \[
   x \times \frac{1}{2} = 7.5
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   To find \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
   \[
   x = 7.5 \times 2 = 15
   \]

Thus, Uriah needs to remove **15 toys** to achieve a total weight reduction of 15 pounds.",0.00204955,13.852500915527344,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,

### Step 1: Calculate revenue for Thursday
- The mechanic repaired 6 truck tires at $60 each:  
  \( 6 \times 60 = 360 \) dollars.
- The mechanic repaired 4 car tires at $40 each:  
  \( 4 \times 40 = 160 \) dollars.
- Total revenue for Thursday:  
  \( 360 + 160 = 520 \) dollars.

1. **Full Pension at 40 Years**: Marcy is entitled to an annual pension of $50,000 if she works for 40 years.
   
2. **Entitlement After 20 Years**: Starting after 20 years of service, she begins accruing pension based on 5% of the full pension value ($50,000) per additional year worked.

   - 5% of the full pension:  
     \( 0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500 \)  
     So, for each year worked beyond 20 years, she accrues $2,500 toward her annual pension.

3. **Years Worked Beyond 20 Years**: Marcy quits after 30 years, which means she has worked:  
   - 30 years total.  
   - Years beyond 20: \( 30 - 20 = 10 \) years.

**1. Adrien's salary four years ago:**
Adrien's old salary = $40,000

**2. Lylah's salary four years ago:**
Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. This means Adrien's salary was 130% of Lylah's salary.
Let L_old be Lylah's salary four years ago.
$40,000 = 1.30 \times L\_old$
$L\_old = \frac{\$40,000}{1.30}$
$L\_old \approx \$30,769.23$

**3. Adrien's salary four years later:**
Adrien's salary increased by 40% from what he was making four years ago.
Adrien's new salary = Adrien's old salary $\times (1 + 0.40)$
Adrien's new salary = $\$40,000 \times 1.40$
Adrien's new salary = $\$56,000$

**4. Lylah's salary four years later:**
The problem states, ""If Adrien's and Lylah's salary increased simultaneously"". Since Adrien's salary increased by 40% and no other increase rate is given for Lylah, the most reasonable interpretation for such problems is that Lylah's salary also increased by the same percentage (40%). This interpretation is also consistent with maintaining the initial proportional difference (30% higher for Adrien).
Lylah's new salary = Lylah's old salary $\times (1 + 0.40)$
Lylah's new salary = $\left(\frac{\$40,000}{1.30}\right) \times 1.40$
Lylah's new salary = $\frac{\$56,000}{1.30}$
Lylah's new salary $\approx \$43,076.92$

**5. Total salary of the two four years later:**
Total new salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
Total new salary = $\$56,000 + \frac{\$56,000}{1.30}$
To sum these, we can find a common denominator:
Total new salary = $\frac{\$56,000 \times 1.30 + \$56,000}{1.30}$
Total new salary = $\frac{\$72,800 + \$56,000}{1.30}$
Total new salary = $\frac{\$128,800}{1.30}$
Total new salary $\approx \$99,076.923076...$

Total new salary = $\$99,076.92$

### Step 1: Understand the problem
- We are told that the number of pink gumballs is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs.
- We know there are 12 blue gumballs.

### Step 2: Define the variables
- Let \( B \) represent the number of blue gumballs. From the problem, \( B = 12 \).
- Let \( P \) represent the number of pink gumballs.

### Step 3: Set up the equation
- According to the problem, the number of pink gumballs (\( P \)) is equal to four times the number of blue gumballs plus 22.
- This gives us the equation:  
  \[
  P = 4 \times B + 22

gsm8k,gsm8k-141,TrustRoute,1,"Let's define the number of each type of bee in the hive:

- Let \( q \) be the number of queen bees.
- Then, the number of baby bees \( b \) is \( 2q \) (since there are twice as many babies as queens).
- The number of worker bees \( w \) is \( 2b \) (since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees).

Now we can express the total number of bees in terms of \( q \):

1. The number of baby bees: \( b = 2q \)
2. The number of worker bees: \( w = 2b = 2(2q) = 4q \)

Now, we can write the total number of bees in the hive:

\[
q + b + w = 700

Substituting \( b \) and \( w \) in terms of \( q \):

\[
q + 2q + 4q = 700

gsm8k,gsm8k-157,TrustRoute,1,"To determine how much farther the winner runs than the loser, we need to calculate the distances run by both Blake and Kelly.

**Blake's Distance:**
Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard football field. Each back-and-forth run consists of running 100 yards to one end and then 100 yards back to the starting point, which totals 200 yards for each complete back-and-forth.

So, for 15 back-and-forth runs:
\[
\text{Distance Blake runs} = 15 \times 200 \text{ yards} = 3000 \text{ yards}
\]

**Kelly's Distance:**
Kelly runs back and forth once on the 100-yard field, which is:
\[
\text{Distance for 1 back-and-forth} = 200 \text{ yards}
\]
After that, she runs to the 40-yard line and back. The distance to the 40-yard line is 40 yards, and the distance back is also 40 yards, making it:
\[
\text{Distance to 40-yard line and back} = 40 + 40 = 80 \text{ yards}
\]
Kelly repeats this 34 times, so the total distance for this part is:
\[
\text{Distance for 34 trips to 40-yard line and back} = 34 \times 80 \text{ yards} = 2720 \text{ yards}
\]

Now, we add the distances Kelly ran:
\[
\text{Total Distance Kelly runs} = 200 \text{ yards} + 2720 \text{ yards} = 2920 \text{ yards}
\]

**Calculating the Difference:**
Now we find out how much farther the winner (Blake) runs than the loser (Kelly):
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Distance Blake} - \text{Distance Kelly} = 3000 \text{ yards} - 2920 \text{ yards} = 80 \text{ yards}
\]

Calculating the votes for the winner:
\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
\]

Now, we can find the number of votes the loser received by subtracting the winner's votes from the total votes:
\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = \text{Total votes} - \text{Votes for the winner} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of votes the loser got is \( \boxed{20} \).",0.0019065500000000001,7.0591607093811035,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_confidence,

2. **Establish the relationship between Jean and Mark:**
   - According to the problem, Jean is two years older than Mark:
     \[
     E = M + 2

3. **Set up the equation based on the information from two years ago:**
   - Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \).

**Team A (Well-rounded team):**
- Each member runs their leg in 55 seconds.
- Total time for Team A = 4 members × 55 seconds/member = 220 seconds.

**Team B (Less well-rounded team):**
- The first runner runs their leg in 60 seconds.
- The second runner runs 3 seconds faster than the first, so they run in 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
- The third runner runs 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run in 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
- The fourth runner runs 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run in 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Now, we can calculate the total time for Team B:
- Total time for Team B = 60 seconds + 57 seconds + 54 seconds + 51 seconds
- Total time for Team B = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

**Now, we can find the difference in time between the two teams:**

1. **Identify the total straw distributed**: We know that 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the rodents.

2. **Calculate the straw used for hamsters**: There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster receives 5 pieces of straw. Let \( h \) be the number of hamsters in each cage. The total straw used for hamsters is:
   \[
   \text{Straw for hamsters} = 10 \times h \times 5 = 50h
   \]

3. **Calculate the straw used for rabbits**: We know that 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

4. **Set up the equation for total straw**: The total straw used for rats, hamsters, and rabbits must equal 160 pieces. The rats are kept in 3 cages, and each rat receives 6 pieces of straw. Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage. The total straw used for rats is:
   \[
   \text{Straw for rats} = 3 \times r \times 6 = 18r
   \]

5. **Combine the equations**: The total straw distributed can be expressed as:
   \[
   18r + 50h + 20 = 160
   \]

6. **Simplify the equation**:
   \[
   18r + 50h = 160 - 20
   \]
   \[
   18r + 50h = 140
   \]

7. **Solve for \( h \)**: We need to express \( h \) in terms of \( r \):
   \[
   50h = 140 - 18r
   \]
   \[
   h = \frac{140 - 18r}{50}
   \]

8. **Find integer solutions**: Since \( h \) must be a non-negative integer, \( 140 - 18r \) must be non-negative and divisible by 50. We can test integer values for \( r \).

   - For \( r = 0 \):
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 0}{50} = 2.8 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]
   - For \( r = 1 \):
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18}{50} = \frac{122}{50} = 2.44 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]
   - For \( r = 2 \):
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 36}{50} = \frac{104}{50} = 2.08 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]
   - For \( r = 3 \):
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 54}{50} = \frac{86}{50} = 1.72 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]
   - For \( r = 4 \):
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 72}{50} = \frac{68}{50} = 1.36 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]
   - For \( r = 5 \):
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 90}{50} = \frac{50}{50} = 1 \quad \text{(integer)}
     \]
   - For \( r = 6 \):
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 108}{50} = \frac{32}{50} = 0.64 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
