   - Total investment = Purchase price + Repair costs = $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

2. **Calculate the increased value of the house**: The value of the house increased by 150%.

1.  **At the green house:** She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners.
    Number sold = S/3
    Remaining = S - S/3 = 2S/3

2.  **At the red house:** She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners.
    Remaining = (2S/3) - 2

3.  **At the orange house:** She sold half of what was left.
    What was left = (2S/3) - 2
    Number sold = [(2S/3) - 2] / 2 = S/3 - 1
    Remaining after orange house = [(2S/3) - 2] - (S/3 - 1)

4.  **Vacuum cleaners left:** She has 5 vacuum cleaners left.
    So, we set the final remaining amount equal to 5:
    [(2S/3) - 2] - (S/3 - 1) = 5

Now, let's solve the equation for S:
2S/3 - 2 - S/3 + 1 = 5
(2S/3 - S/3) - 2 + 1 = 5
S/3 - 1 = 5

Add 1 to both sides:
S/3 = 5 + 1
S/3 = 6

Multiply both sides by 3:
S = 6 * 3
S = 18

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

**Check the answer:**
*   Starts with 18.
*   Green house: Sells 1/3 of 18 = 6.
    Remaining: 18 - 6 = 12.
*   Red house: Sells 2.

1. **Diamonds**: The number of diamonds is given as 175.

2. **Rubies**: The number of rubies is 35 fewer than the number of diamonds. Therefore, we calculate the number of rubies as follows:
   \[
   \text{Rubies} = \text{Diamonds} - 35 = 175 - 35 = 140
   \]

3. **Emeralds**: The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies. Thus, we calculate the number of emeralds as follows:

gsm8k,gsm8k-93,TrustRoute,1,"To solve this problem, let's reason step by step based on the information provided.

### Step 1: Understand the relationship in the past
- Lee used to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald.
- We are told that Lee currently runs it in 38 seconds. Assuming Lee's time hasn't changed (as there's no indication otherwise), this was also his time in the past.
- Therefore, Gerald's past time was Lee's past time plus 2 seconds:
  \[
  \text{Gerald's past time} = 38 + 2 = 40 \text{ seconds}
  \]

### Step 2: Account for Gerald's improvement
- Gerald improved his speed by 10%. Speed and time are inversely related for a fixed distance (like 400 meters).
- If Gerald's speed increased by 10%, his new speed is 110% of his old speed, or 1.1 times his old speed.
- New time = Old time × (Old speed / New speed) = Old time / 1.1
- So, Gerald's new time is:
  \[
  \text{Gerald's new time} = \frac{\text{Gerald's past time}}{1.1} = \frac{40}{1.1}
  \]

### Step 3: Perform the calculation
- \[
  \frac{40}{1.1} = \frac{40 \times 10}{1.1 \times 10} = \frac{400}{11} \approx 36.3636 \text{ seconds}
  \]
- To two decimal places, this is approximately 36.36 seconds.

### Final Answer:
Gerald, with his improved diet, can now run the 400-meter hurdles in approximately **36.36 seconds**.",0.00231975,28.215683460235596,0,0,cand-grok-3-mini,stage2_confidence,

- The number of dogs is 60.
- There are two cats for every dog.
- The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats.
- We need to find the total number of pets (rabbits + dogs + cats).

### Step 1: Calculate the number of cats
Since there are two cats for every dog and there are 60 dogs:
- Number of cats = 2 × Number of dogs = 2 × 60 = 120.

### Step 2: Calculate the combined number of dogs and cats
- Combined number = Number of dogs + Number of cats = 60 + 120 = 180.

The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats:
- Number of rabbits = Combined number - 12 = 180 - 12 = 168.

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of pets

- Let \( B \) be the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold.
- Let \( D \) be the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph (noting that the problem mentions ""birds"" but specifies a photograph of ducks, so I'll assume this refers to ducks).

### Step 2: Relate Jamal's and Brittany's phone capacities
The problem states that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. Interpreting this as ""6 times as many as,"" we have:
\[
J = 6 \times B
\]
Substitute the known value:
\[
1800 = 6 \times B

Solve for \( B \):
\[
B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300
\]
So, Brittany's phone can hold a maximum of 300 photographs.

### Step 3: Relate Brittany's phone capacity to the number of ducks
The problem states that the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. Interpreting this as ""50 times as many as,"" we have:
\[
B = 50 \times D

Substitute the value of \( B \):
\[
300 = 50 \times D

Solve for \( D \):

1.  **Adrien's salary four years ago:**
    Adrien's initial salary (A_initial) = $40,000

2.  **Lylah's salary four years ago:**
    Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. This means Adrien's salary was 130% of Lylah's salary.
    A_initial = 1.30 * L_initial
    $40,000 = 1.30 * L_initial
    L_initial = $40,000 / 1.30
    L_initial ≈ $30,769.23

3.  **Adrien's salary four years later:**
    Adrien's salary increased by 40% from his initial salary.
    A_final = A_initial * (1 + 0.40)
    A_final = $40,000 * 1.40
    A_final = $56,000

4.  **Lylah's salary four years later:**
    The problem states, ""If Adrien's and Lylah's salary increased simultaneously"". In such problems, when no specific increase for the second person is given, it's generally implied that the percentage increase was the same for both, or that the ratio of their salaries remained constant. Both interpretations lead to the same conclusion: Lylah's salary also increased by 40%.
    L_final = L_initial * (1 + 0.40)
    L_final = ($40,000 / 1.30) * 1.40
    L_final = $56,000 / 1.30
    L_final ≈ $43,076.92

5.  **Total salary the two were receiving four years later:**
    Total_final = A_final + L_final
    Total_final = $56,000 + ($56,000 / 1.30)
    To make calculation easier, we can factor out $56,000:
    Total_final = $56,000 * (1 + 1/1.30)
    Total_final = $56,000 * (1.30/1.30 + 1/1.30)

    Total_final = $128,800 / 1.30

### Step 1: Calculate Blake's distance
- The football field is 100 yards long.
- A ""back and forth"" means running from one end (e.g., 0 yards) to the other end (100 yards) and back, which is a total of 200 yards (100 yards out + 100 yards back).
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times.
- Total distance for Blake: 15 × 200 yards = 3000 yards.

### Step 2: Calculate Kelly's distance
- Kelly first runs back and forth once, which is 200 yards.
- Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times.
  - Running to the 40-yard line from one end (e.g., 0 yards) is 40 yards.
  - Running back from the 40-yard line to the starting point is another 40 yards.
  - So, each ""to the 40-yard line and back"" is 40 yards + 40 yards = 80 yards.

1. **Cost of the hat**: 
   The cost of the hat is given as $25.

2. **Cost of the jacket**: 
   The jacket costs three times as much as the hat. 
   \[
   \text{Cost of the jacket} = 3 \times \text{Cost of the hat} = 3 \times 25 = 75
   \]

3. **Cost of the pants**: 
   The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. 
   First, we calculate the average:
   \[
   \text{Average cost} = \frac{\text{Cost of the hat} + \text{Cost of the jacket}}{2} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50

1. **Rats**: 
   - Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage.
   - There are 3 cages of rats, so the total number of rats is \( 3r \).
   - Each rat receives 6 pieces of straw, so the total straw given to rats is:
     \[
     \text{Straw for rats} = 3r \times 6 = 18r
     \]

2. **Hamsters**:
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster receives 5 pieces of straw.
   - Let \( h \) be the number of hamsters in each cage.
   - The total number of hamsters is \( 10h \), and the total straw given to hamsters is:
     \[
     \text{Straw for hamsters} = 10h \times 5 = 50h
     \]

3. **Rabbits**:
   - The problem states that 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

4. **Total Straw Distributed**:
   - The total straw distributed among all rodents is given as 160 pieces. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     18r + 50h + 20 = 160
     \]

5. **Simplifying the Equation**:
   - Subtract 20 from both sides:
     \[
     18r + 50h = 140
     \]

6. **Finding Possible Values**:
   - We can now find integer values for \( r \) and \( h \) that satisfy this equation. Rearranging gives:
     \[
     18r = 140 - 50h
     \]
   - This means \( 140 - 50h \) must be divisible by 18. We can test integer values for \( h \):

   - **If \( h = 0 \)**:
     \[
     18r = 140 \quad \Rightarrow \quad r = \frac{140}{18} \approx 7.78 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]

   - **If \( h = 1 \)**:
     \[
     18r = 140 - 50 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 18r = 90 \quad \Rightarrow \quad r = 5 \quad \text{(valid)}
     \]

   - **If \( h = 2 \)**:
     \[
     18r = 140 - 100 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 18r = 40 \quad \Rightarrow \quad r = \frac{40}{18} \approx 2.22 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]

   - **If \( h = 3 \)**:
     \[
     18r = 140 - 150 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 18r = -10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad r \text{ cannot be negative}

   3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of peaches collected**: John collects 2 peaches per minute. Therefore, in 180 minutes, he collects:
   \[
   180 \text{ minutes} \times 2 \text{ peaches/minute} = 360 \text{ peaches}
   \]

gsm8k,gsm8k-191,TrustRoute,1,"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks needs per day, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total weekly food requirement for the flock**:
   Each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week. For 10 ducks:
   \[
   \text{Total weekly food} = 3.5 \, \text{pounds/duck} \times 10 \, \text{ducks} = 35 \, \text{pounds}
   \]

2. **Convert the weekly requirement to a daily requirement**:
   There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total weekly food by 7:
   \[
   \text{Daily food requirement} = \frac{35 \, \text{pounds}}{7 \, \text{days}} = 5 \, \text{pounds/day}
   \]

Therefore, the flock of ten ducks needs **5 pounds of insects per day**.",0.00169855,10.758272886276245,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.

2. **Net growth of trees per year**: 
   - Tom plants 10 trees each year.
   - He chops down 2 trees each year.
   - Therefore, the net increase in trees per year is:
     \[
     10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
     \]

3. **Total growth over 10 years**:
   - In 10 years, the total increase in trees is:
     \[
     8 \text{ trees/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 80 \text{ trees}
     \]

4. **Total number of trees after 10 years**:
   - Starting with 50 trees and adding the 80 trees grown over 10 years:
     \[
     50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees}
     \]

5. **Percentage of trees that die**:
   - After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. 
   - To find out how many trees die:
     \[
     30\% \text{ of } 130 = 0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees}
     \]

6. **Total number of trees left**:
   - Subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees:

1. **Initial Flamingos**: On Friday morning, Sue had 18 pink flamingos in her yard.

2. **Saturday's Changes**:
   - The neighbors took back one third of the flamingos. 
   - One third of 18 is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6
     \]
   - So, 6 flamingos were taken back and painted white. 
   - After this, the number of pink flamingos left is:
     \[
     18 - 6 = 12
     \]
   - The number of white flamingos added is 6.

3. **Sunday's Changes**:
   - On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink flamingos.
   - The total number of pink flamingos now is:
     \[
     12 + 18 = 30

4. **Final Count**:
   - At noon on Sunday, Sue has:
     - 30 pink flamingos
     - 6 white flamingos

5. **Difference Calculation**:

gsm8k,gsm8k-194,TrustRoute,1,"To determine how much change Violetta will get after buying the crayons, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the crayons**: 
   - Violetta needs 5 different colors of crayons.
   - Each crayon costs $2.
   - Therefore, the total cost is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of crayons} \times \text{Cost per crayon} = 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ dollars}

Now, we add these two amounts together:

\[
\text{Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser} = 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50
\]

So, the cost of one pen is $1.50.

Next, we need to find the cost of 8 pens:

\[
\text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times \text{Cost of one pen} = 8 \times 1.50

Calculating that:

\[
8 \times 1.50 = 12.00

2. **Cards Collected in the First Month**: 
   - She collected three times her initial number of cards.
   - Cards collected in the first month = \(3 \times 20 = 60\).

3. **Total Cards After the First Month**:
   - Total cards after the first month = Initial cards + Cards collected in the first month
   - Total after first month = \(20 + 60 = 80\).

4. **Cards Collected in the Second Month**:
   - She collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month.
   - Cards collected in the second month = \(60 - 20 = 40\).

5. **Total Cards After the Second Month**:
   - Total cards after the second month = Total after first month + Cards collected in the second month
   - Total after second month = \(80 + 40 = 120\).

6. **Cards Collected in the Third Month**:
   - She collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months.

1. **Determine the payment from Publisher A:**
   - Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers.
   - He edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, so he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B.
   - Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence.
   - Therefore, the payment from Publisher A is:
     \[
     \text{Payment from A} = 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents}
     \]

2. **Determine the payment from Publisher B:**
   - Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, which means Publisher B pays:
     \[
     \text{Payment per sentence from B} = 2 \times 5 \text{ cents} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence}
     \]
   - Therefore, the payment from Publisher B is:
