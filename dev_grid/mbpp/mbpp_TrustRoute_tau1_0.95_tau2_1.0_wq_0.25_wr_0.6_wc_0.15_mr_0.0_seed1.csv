def even_bit_set_number(n):
    mask = 0xAAAAAAAA
    return n | mask
```

Wait, let me reconsider. The function needs to work for numbers of any size, and we need to determine what ""even bits"" means (0-indexed or 1-indexed).

Given the test case: `even_bit_set_number(10) == 10`
- 10 in binary is `1010`
- If we consider bits at positions 0, 1, 2, 3... (0-indexed), even positions are 0, 2, 4...
- Position 0: 0, Position 1: 1, Position 2: 0, Position 3: 1
- Setting even positions (0, 2, 4...) would give: `1011` = 11 ❌

Let me try 1-indexed (bits 1, 2, 3, 4...):
- Bit 1: 0, Bit 2: 1, Bit 3: 0, Bit 4: 1
- Setting even bits (2, 4, 6...) would give: `1010` = 10 ✓

So ""even bits"" means bits at positions 2, 4, 6... (1-indexed), which is positions 1, 3, 5... (0-indexed).

```python
def even_bit_set_number(n):
    mask = 0xAAAAAAAA
    bit_length = n.bit_length() if n > 0 else 1
    mask = mask & ((1 << (bit_length + (bit_length % 2))) - 1)
    return n | mask
```

Actually, simpler approach:

```python
def even_bit_set_number(n):
    mask = 0
    i = 1
    while (1 << i) <= n or i < 32:
        mask |= (1 << i)
        i += 2
        if (1 << i) > n and i >= 32:
            break
    return n | mask
```

Most concise solution:

```python
def even_bit_set_number(n):
    return n | 0xAAAAAAAA
