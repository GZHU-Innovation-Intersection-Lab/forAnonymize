mbpp,Mbpp/573,TrustRoute,1,"To solve this problem, we need to compute the product of all unique numbers in a given list. The uniqueness ensures that each number contributes only once to the product, regardless of how many times it appears in the original list.

### Approach
1. **Extract Unique Elements**: Convert the input list into a set to eliminate duplicate elements. This set contains only the unique numbers from the list.
2. **Compute Product**: Multiply all elements in the set together. Starting the product at 1 allows us to iteratively multiply each element in the set to accumulate the final product.

### Solution Code
```python
def unique_product(lst):
    unique_nums = set(lst)
    product = 1
    for num in unique_nums:
        product *= num
    return product
```

### Explanation
1. **Extracting Unique Elements**: The `set(lst)` operation converts the input list into a set, which inherently removes any duplicate values. For example, given the list `[10, 20, 30, 40, 20, 50, 60, 40]`, the set becomes `{10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60}`.
2. **Computing the Product**: Initialize the product as 1. Iterate over each number in the set, multiplying each number with the running product. For the example set, the product is calculated as \(10 \times 20 \times 30 \times 40 \times 50 \times 60 = 720000000\).

This approach efficiently handles the uniqueness requirement using a set and computes the product in linear time relative to the number of unique elements, making it optimal for most practical scenarios.",0.0019152,76.275639295578,0,0,cand-deepseek-r1,stage2_confidence,

Wait, let me reconsider. The assertion shows the result is 11, not a sum of values. Let me check:

- If we need subsequence up to index 4 (i=4) including element at index 6 (k=6)
- Result is 11, which suggests counting elements, not summing

mbpp,Mbpp/590,TrustRoute,1,"To convert polar coordinates `(r, theta)` to rectangular coordinates `(x, y)`, the formulas are `x = r * cos(theta)` and `y = r * sin(theta)`. The `cmath.rect` function in Python directly provides this conversion, returning the coordinates as a complex number.

The provided `assert` statement appears to be inconsistent with the function's description ""convert polar coordinates to rectangular coordinates.""
If `polar_rect(3, 4)` is called with `r=3` and `theta=4` (radians):
`x = 3 * cos(4) approx -1.96093`
`y = 3 * sin(4) approx -2.27041`
So, the expected output according to the description would be `((-1.96093..., -2.27041...), (-1.96093... - 2.27041...j))`.

The assert `polar_rect(3,4)==((5.0, 0.9272952180016122), (-2+2.4492935982947064e-16j))` implies that:
1. The inputs `(3, 4)` are interpreted as Cartesian coordinates `(x, y)`.
2. The first part of the output `(5.0, 0.927...)` is the polar representation `(r, theta)` of `(x=3, y=4)` (i.e., `cmath.polar(complex(3, 4))`).
3. The second part `(-2 + 2.449...e-16j)` (effectively `-2 + 0j`) is a constant or an unrelated value.

mbpp,Mbpp/390,TrustRoute,1,"To solve this problem, we need to apply a given format string to each element in a list. The format string contains a placeholder `{0}` which will be replaced by each element of the list. The solution involves iterating over each element in the list and formatting the string accordingly.

### Approach
1. **Iterate over each element**: For each element in the input list, apply the format string using Python's built-in string formatting.
2. **String formatting**: Use the `format` method of strings to replace the placeholder `{0}` with the current element from the list.
3. **Return the formatted list**: Collect all formatted strings into a new list and return it.

### Solution Code
```python
def add_string(lst, fmt):
    return [fmt.format(x) for x in lst]
```

### Explanation
- **List Comprehension**: The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element `x` in the input list `lst`.
- **String Formatting**: For each element `x`, the format string `fmt` is applied using `fmt.format(x)`. This replaces the placeholder `{0}` in `fmt` with the value of `x`.
- **Result Construction**: The result of each formatting operation is collected into a new list, which is then returned.

This approach efficiently processes each element in the list with minimal overhead, leveraging Python's built-in string formatting capabilities for clarity and performance. The solution handles any data type that can be converted to a string via the format operation, making it versatile for different use cases.",0.00268725,13.51146650314331,0,0,cand-deepseek-r1,stage2_confidence,
mbpp,Mbpp/87,TrustRoute,1,"To solve this problem, we need to merge three dictionaries into a single dictionary. If there are overlapping keys, the value from the last dictionary containing that key should take precedence. This can be efficiently achieved using dictionary unpacking.

### Approach
The approach involves combining all three dictionaries into one using the unpacking operator (`**`). The unpacking operator allows us to merge multiple dictionaries into a new dictionary. When keys overlap, the value from the last dictionary passed will overwrite any previous values for the same key. This ensures that the final dictionary contains all key-value pairs from the input dictionaries, with conflicts resolved in favor of the last occurrence.

### Solution Code
```python
def merge_dictionaries_three(dict1, dict2, dict3):
    return {**dict1, **dict2, **dict3}
```

### Explanation
1. **Dictionary Unpacking**: The `**` operator unpacks each dictionary into the new dictionary. The order of unpacking is important because later dictionaries overwrite earlier ones for overlapping keys.
2. **Merging Process**: The function merges `dict1`, `dict2`, and `dict3` in sequence. For example:
   - Keys unique to any dictionary are included directly.
   - If a key exists in multiple dictionaries, the value from the last dictionary (in the order passed) is retained.
3. **Efficiency**: This approach runs in linear time relative to the total number of key-value pairs across all dictionaries, making it efficient.

This method is concise and leverages Python's built-in capabilities for dictionary merging, ensuring correctness and simplicity.",0.00325999,16.322695016860962,0,0,cand-deepseek-r1,stage2_confidence,

**Explanation:**

A number can be represented as the difference of two squares (a² - b²) if and only if it's NOT of the form 4k + 2.

- Any odd number can be expressed as: n = ((n+1)/2)² - ((n-1)/2)²
- Numbers of form 4k can be expressed as: 4k = (k+1)² - (k-1)²
- Numbers of form 4k + 1 are odd (covered above)
- Numbers of form 4k + 3 are odd (covered above)
- Numbers of form 4k + 2 CANNOT be expressed as difference of two squares",0.00666479,19.251578330993652,0,0,cand-claude-sonnet-4-5,stage2_confidence,

This works because polite numbers are positive integers that can be expressed as the sum of consecutive positive integers in at least one way (excluding the trivial case of the number itself).
