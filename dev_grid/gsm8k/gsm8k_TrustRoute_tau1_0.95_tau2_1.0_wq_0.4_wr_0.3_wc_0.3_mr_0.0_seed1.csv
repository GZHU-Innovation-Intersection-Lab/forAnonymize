1. **Calculate the total number of eggs laid per day**: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.

2. **Determine how many eggs she consumes**: Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs for baking muffins. Therefore, the total number of eggs she consumes daily is:
   \[
   3 \text{ (for breakfast)} + 4 \text{ (for muffins)} = 7 \text{ eggs}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of eggs remaining for sale**: To find out how many eggs are left after Janet consumes some, we subtract the number of eggs she eats from the total number of eggs laid:
   \[
   16 \text{ (total eggs)} - 7 \text{ (eggs consumed)} = 9 \text{ eggs}
   \]

4. **Determine the earnings from selling the eggs**: Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 per egg. Therefore, her total earnings from selling the eggs at the farmers' market is:
   \[
   9 \text{ (eggs)} \times 2 \text{ (dollars per egg)} = 18 \text{ dollars}

1. **Cost of shorts**:
   - Number of pairs of shorts = 3
   - Cost per pair of shorts = $16.50
   - Total cost for shorts = 3 pairs × $16.50/pair = $49.50

2. **Cost of pants**:
   - Number of pairs of pants = 3
   - Cost per pair of pants = $22.50
   - Total cost for pants = 3 pairs × $22.50/pair = $67.50

3. **Cost of shoes**:
   - Number of pairs of shoes = 3
   - Cost per pair of shoes = $42.00

- We are told that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, and this is assumed to be his current time, which was also his time before Gerald's improvement.

1.  **Jamal's phone capacity:** We are given that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
    *   Jamal's capacity = 1800 photos

2.  **Brittany's phone capacity:** We know Jamal's phone can hold 6 times *more* photographs than Brittany's. This means Jamal's capacity is 6 times Brittany's capacity.
    *   Jamal's capacity = 6 * Brittany's capacity
    *   1800 = 6 * Brittany's capacity
    *   Brittany's capacity = 1800 / 6
    *   Brittany's capacity = 300 photographs

3.  **Number of ducks:** We are told that Brittany's phone capacity is 50 times *more than* the number of birds (ducks) in Jamal's photograph.
    *   The phrasing ""X times more than Y"" generally means `Y + X*Y`, or `(X+1)*Y`.
    *   However, in many word problems, ""X times more than Y"" is sometimes loosely used to mean ""X times as many as Y"" (i.e., `X*Y`), especially when dealing with discrete items that must be whole numbers (like ducks). If we strictly interpret ""50 times more than"", it would lead to a non-integer number of ducks, which doesn't make sense. Given that ducks are whole entities, we will proceed with the more common *intended* meaning for such problems, which is `50 * number of ducks`.
    *   Brittany's capacity = 50 * (number of ducks)
    *   300 = 50 * (number of ducks)
    *   Number of ducks = 300 / 50
    *   Number of ducks = 6

Therefore, there can be 6 ducks seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

*   Let Lylah's salary four years ago be $L_{old}$.

- Let’s call the number of spoons in the package Julia bought \( X \).
- After buying, she has \( X \) spoons.

### Step 3: Add the spoons from her husband
- Her husband gave her a package of 5 spoons.

### Step 1: Determine the cost of each item
- **Cost of one pepper**: You mentioned that each pepper costs $15.
- **Cost of one watermelon**: A watermelon costs three times the cost of a pepper.  
  So, cost of one watermelon = 3 × $15 = $45.
- **Cost of one orange**: An orange costs $5 less than a watermelon.  
  So, cost of one orange = $45 - $5 = $40.

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost for each type of item
- **Watermelons**: Dillon buys 4 watermelons.  
  Total cost for watermelons = 4 × $45 = $180.
- **Peppers**: Dillon buys 20 peppers.

*   Let `Q` be the number of queen bees.
*   Let `B` be the number of baby bees.
*   Let `W` be the number of worker bees.

From the problem statement, we have:
1.  `W + B + Q = 700` (Total bees)
2.  `W = 2B` (Twice as many worker bees as baby bees)
3.  `B = 2Q` (Twice as many babies as queens)

Now, we can substitute to express everything in terms of one variable, let's use `Q`:

*   Since `B = 2Q`
*   And `W = 2B`, we can substitute `2Q` for `B`: `W = 2 * (2Q) = 4Q`

Now substitute `W`, `B`, and `Q` (all in terms of `Q`) into the total equation:
`4Q + 2Q + Q = 700`
`7Q = 700`
`Q = 700 / 7`
`Q = 100`

    Before the ants, there were 5 + 1 = 6 french fries.

2.  **Later, a raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries.**
    If the raccoon stole two thirds, then one third of the fries were left. This one third is equal to the 6 fries we just calculated.

    Fries before raccoon = 6 * 3 = 18 french fries.

3.  **Then three pigeons bullied him away from the food, and each pigeon ate three fries.**
    The pigeons ate 3 pigeons * 3 fries/pigeon = 9 french fries.
    Before the pigeons, there were 18 + 9 = 27 french fries.

4.  **When the seagull landed, he gobbled down half the amount of french fries that Dave ate.**
    Dave ate 14 fries, so the seagull ate 14 / 2 = 7 french fries.
    Before the seagull, there were 27 + 7 = 34 french fries.

5.  **Dave bought a large pack of french fries and ate fourteen before a hungry seagull stole the pack out of his hand.**
    Before Dave ate his share, there were 34 + 14 = 48 french fries.

So, there were 48 french fries in the pack when Dave bought it.

**Double-check:**
*   Start with 48 fries.
*   Dave ate 14: 48 - 14 = 34 fries left.
*   Seagull ate 14/2 = 7: 34 - 7 = 27 fries left.

### Step 1: Calculate Blake's total distance
- Blake runs back and forth on a 100-yard football field 15 times.
- One back-and-forth run is from one end (e.g., 0 yards) to the other end (100 yards) and back, which is 100 yards + 100 yards = 200 yards.
- For 15 back-and-forth runs:  
  \( 15 \times 200 = 3000 \) yards.

So, Blake ran a total of 3000 yards.

### Step 2: Calculate Kelly's total distance
- Kelly first runs back and forth once on the 100-yard field, which is 200 yards (as calculated above).
- Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times.
  - Running to the 40-yard line from one end (e.g., the 0-yard line) is 40 yards.
  - Running back from the 40-yard line to the starting point is another 40 yards.
  - So, one trip to the 40-yard line and back is 40 + 40 = 80 yards.
  - For 34 trips:  
    \( 34 \times 80 = 2720 \) yards.
- Kelly's total distance:  
  \( 200 + 2720 = 2920 \) yards.

So, Kelly ran a total of 2920 yards.

### Step 3: Determine the winner and the difference
- Blake ran 3000 yards, and Kelly ran 2920 yards.
- Blake ran farther, so Blake is the winner.
- The difference in distance:  
  \( 3000 - 2920 = 80 \) yards.

1. **Total Budget**: €1500
2. **Cost of the Computer**: €1090
3. **Cost of the Scanner**: €157
4. **Cost of the CD Burner**: €74
5. **Cost of the Printer**: €102

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the computer and accessories:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost of Computer} + \text{Cost of Scanner} + \text{Cost of CD Burner} + \text{Cost of Printer}
\]

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 1090 + 157 + 74 + 102

   - We can express \( h \) in terms of \( r \) or vice versa. Let's isolate \( h \):
     \[
     50h = 140 - 18r
     \]
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18r}{50}
     \]

7. **Find integer solutions:**
   - Since \( h \) must be a non-negative integer, \( 140 - 18r \) must be non-negative and divisible by 50. We can test integer values for \( r \):
     - For \( r = 0 \):
       \[
       h = \frac{140 - 18 \times 0}{50} = \frac{140}{50} = 2.8 \quad (\text{not an integer})
       \]
     - For \( r = 1 \):
       \[
       h = \frac{140 - 18 \times 1}{50} = \frac{122}{50} = 2.44 \quad (\text{not an integer})
       \]
     - For \( r = 2 \):
       \[
       h = \frac{140 - 18 \times 2}{50} = \frac{104}{50} = 2.08 \quad (\text{not an integer})
       \]
     - For \( r = 3 \):
       \[
       h = \frac{140 - 18 \times 3}{50} = \frac{86}{50} = 1.72 \quad (\text{not an integer})
       \]
     - For \( r = 4 \):
       \[
       h = \frac{140 - 18 \times 4}{50} = \frac{68}{50} = 1.36 \quad (\text{not an integer})
       \]
     - For \( r = 5 \):
       \[
       h = \frac{140 - 18 \times 5}{50} = \frac{50}{50} = 1 \quad (\text{integer})
       \]
     - For \( r = 6 \):
       \[
       h = \frac{140 - 18 \times 6}{50} = \frac{32}{50} = 0.64 \quad (\text{not an integer})
       \]
     - For \( r = 7 \):
       \[
       h = \frac{140 - 18 \times 7}{50} = \frac{14}{50} = 0.28 \quad (\text{not an integer})
       \]

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The only integer solution we found is when \( r = 5 \) and \( h = 1 \).
   - Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is \( \boxed{5} \).",0.0035730500000000004,24.509068489074707,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,
gsm8k,gsm8k-187,TrustRoute,1,"To calculate how much Mandy owes Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can use the formula for compound interest:

\[
A = P(1 + r)^n
\]

Where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n months, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (as a decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of months the money is borrowed.

In this case:
- \( P = 100 \)
- \( r = 0.02 \) (2% as a decimal)
- \( n = 3 \)

Now, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[
A = 100(1 + 0.02)^3
\]

Calculating inside the parentheses first:

\[
1 + 0.02 = 1.02
\]

Now raise it to the power of 3:

\[
1.02^3 = 1.061208
\]

Now multiply by the principal:

\[
A = 100 \times 1.061208 = 106.1208
\]

Thus, after rounding to two decimal places, Mandy should give Benedict approximately **$106.12**.",0.0037472500000000006,14.801307678222656,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_confidence,

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of bags of wheat the trader bought and sold.

2. **Calculate Costs**:
   - The cost of buying the bags: \( 20x \) (since each bag costs $20).
   - The cost of transporting the bags: \( 2x \) (since it costs $2 to transport each bag).
   - Total cost: \( 20x + 2x = 22x \).

3. **Calculate Revenue**:
   - The revenue from selling the bags: \( 30x \) (since each bag is sold for $30).

4. **Calculate Profit**:
   - Profit is defined as Revenue - Cost.
   - Given that the total profit is $400, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Cost}
   \]
   \[
   400 = 30x - 22x

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.

2. **Net growth of trees per year**:
   - Trees planted per year: 10
   - Trees chopped down per year: 2
   - Net increase in trees per year = Trees planted - Trees chopped down = 10 - 2 = 8 trees.

3. **Total trees after 10 years without considering deaths**:
