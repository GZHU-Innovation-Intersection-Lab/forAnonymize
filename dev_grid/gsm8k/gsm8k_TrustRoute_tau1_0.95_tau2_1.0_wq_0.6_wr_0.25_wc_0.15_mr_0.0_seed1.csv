1. **Calculate the total number of eggs laid per day**: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.

2. **Determine how many eggs she uses for breakfast and baking**:
   - She eats 3 eggs for breakfast.
   - She uses 4 eggs for baking muffins.
   - Total eggs used = 3 (for breakfast) + 4 (for baking) = 7 eggs.

We are given two pieces of information:
1.  Gretchen has a total of 110 coins:
    G + S = 110

2.  There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins:
    G = S + 30

Now we can solve this system of equations.
Substitute the second equation into the first equation:
(S + 30) + S = 110

Combine the S terms:
2S + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:
2S = 110 - 30
2S = 80

Divide by 2 to find the number of silver coins:
S = 80 / 2
S = 40

Now that we know there are 40 silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation (G = S + 30):
G = 40 + 30
G = 70

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

To verify:
Gold coins (70) + Silver coins (40) = 110 total coins (Correct)

### Step 1: Define the variables
- Let \( H \) represent the number of copies Harald sold.
- According to the problem, Marilyn sold 10 times as many copies as Harald, so Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies.

### Step 2: Set up the equation
- Together, they sold 88,000 copies, so:
  \[
  H + 10H = 88,000
  \]
- Simplify the equation:
  \[
  11H = 88,000

### Step 1: Understand the relationship in the past
- Lee used to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald.
- We are told that Lee currently runs it in 38 seconds. Assuming Lee's time has not changed, his past time was also 38 seconds.
- Therefore, Gerald's past time was Lee's past time plus 2 seconds:
  \[
  \text{Gerald's past time} = 38 + 2 = 40 \text{ seconds}.
  \]

### Step 2: Account for Gerald's improvement
- Gerald improved his speed by 10%. Speed and time are inversely related for a fixed distance (400 meters in this case).
- If speed increases by 10%, the new speed is 110% (or 1.1 times) of the original speed.
- Since time is inversely proportional to speed, Gerald's new time can be calculated as:
  \[
  \text{New time} = \frac{\text{Past time}}{1.1}
  \]
- Substituting Gerald's past time:
  \[
  \text{New time} = \frac{40}{1.1} = \frac{40 \times 10}{11} = \frac{400}{11} \approx 36.36 \text{ seconds}.

- Total vehicles from the first day: \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) vehicles.

### Step 2: Account for the total vehicles after the second day
- After the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port is 30.
- Let \( x \) be the number of containers imported on the second day.
- Each of these containers also has 5 vehicles, so the vehicles from the second day are \( 5x \).
- The total vehicles are the sum of the vehicles from both days: \( 10 + 5x = 30 \).

1. **Determine Lylah's Salary Four Years Ago**:
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's.
   - Let Lylah's salary four years ago be \( L \).
   - According to the problem, we have:
     \[
     40000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L
     \]
   - To find \( L \), we can rearrange the equation:
     \[
     L = \frac{40000}{1.3} \approx 30769.23
     \]

2. **Calculate Adrien's Salary Four Years Later**:
   - Adrien's salary increased by 40% over the four years.
   - His new salary is:
     \[
     \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 0.4 \times 40000 = 40000 \times 1.4 = 56000
     \]

3. **Determine Lylah's Salary Increase**:
   - Since the problem states that Lylah's salary increased simultaneously, we need to find out how much Lylah's salary increased.
   - We are not given a specific percentage for Lylah's salary increase, so we will denote her new salary as:
     \[
     \text{Lylah's new salary} = L + x
     \]
   - We need to calculate \( x \) based on the information about Adrien's increase or assume \( x \) leads to a direct relationship between their salaries.

4. **Calculate the Total Salary Four Years Later**:
   - The total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later is:
     \[
     \text{Total Salary} = \text{Adrien's new salary} + \text{Lylah's new salary}
     \]
   - We already computed Adrien's new salary as $56,000. 
   - We need to determine Lylah's new salary based on a certain assumption. If we assume she received a similar increase percentage as Adrien’s, we can model it; however, we need to make sure to define what that is.

Assuming Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage (40%) for simplicity:

   - Lylah's new salary would be:
     \[
     \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 \times 1.4 \approx 43076.92
     \]

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - Now we can calculate the total salary four years later:
     \[
     \text{Total Salary} = 56000 + 43076.92 \approx 99076.92

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the items
- **Subs:** 2 subs at $7.50 each = 2 × $7.50 = $15.00
- **Bags of chips:** 2 bags at $1.50 each = 2 × $1.50 = $3.00
- **Cookies:** 2 cookies at $1.00 each = 2 × $1.00 = $2.00

**Subtotal (cost of items only):** $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

### Step 2: Add the delivery fee
- The delivery fee is 20% of the subtotal.
- 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 × $20.00 = $4.00

**Total after delivery fee:** $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

### Step 3: Add the tip
- Rory wants to add a $5.00 tip.
- Total cost including tip: $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

### Final Answer
The total cost of Rory's delivery order will be **$29.00**. This includes the cost of the items ($20.00), the 20% delivery fee ($4.00), and the $5.00 tip.

   \[
   q + b + w = 700
   \]

2. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees:
   \[
   w = 2b
   \]

3. There are twice as many baby bees as queens:
   \[
   b = 2q

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( w \) and \( b \) in terms of \( q \) into the first equation.

From \( b = 2q \), we can express \( w \) as:
\[
w = 2b = 2(2q) = 4q
\]

Now, substituting \( b \) and \( w \) into the total bee equation:
\[
q + b + w = 700

becomes:
\[
q + 2q + 4q = 700
\]
which simplifies to:

q = \frac{700}{7} = 100

\[
b = 2q = 2(100) = 200

1. **Calculate the total length of the rolls:**
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls.
   - Total length of rolls = Number of rolls × Length of each roll
   \[
   \text{Total length of rolls} = 300 \times 4 = 1200 \text{ inches}

   \text{Total length of croissants} = 120 \times 6 = 720 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total length of the baguettes:**
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert the length of the baguette to inches:
   \[
   2 \text{ feet} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ inches}
   \]
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes.
   - Total length of baguettes = Number of baguettes × Length of each baguette

**Blake's Distance:**
Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard football field. Each back-and-forth run covers:

- From one end to the other (100 yards) and back (100 yards) = 200 yards.

So, for 15 back-and-forth runs, Blake's total distance is:

\[
\text{Blake's distance} = 15 \times 200 \text{ yards} = 3000 \text{ yards}
\]

**Kelly's Distance:**
Kelly runs back and forth once on the 100-yard field, which is:

- From one end to the other (100 yards) and back (100 yards) = 200 yards.

After that, she runs to the 40-yard line and back. The distance to the 40-yard line is 40 yards, so the round trip to the 40-yard line and back is:

\[
\text{Distance to 40-yard line and back} = 40 \text{ yards} \times 2 = 80 \text{ yards}
\]

Kelly runs this 34 times, so her total distance for the 40-yard line runs is:

\[
\text{Kelly's distance to 40-yard line} = 34 \times 80 \text{ yards} = 2720 \text{ yards}
\]

Now, we can calculate Kelly's total distance:

\[
\text{Total distance for Kelly} = 200 \text{ yards (initial run)} + 2720 \text{ yards} = 2920 \text{ yards}
\]

**Comparing Distances:**
Now we find out how much farther Blake runs than Kelly:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Blake's distance} - \text{Kelly's distance} = 3000 \text{ yards} - 2920 \text{ yards} = 80 \text{ yards}

3. **Cost of the scanner**: €157
4. **Cost of the CD burner**: €74
5. **Cost of the printer**: €102

2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28:

gsm8k,gsm8k-186,TrustRoute,1,"To find out how many rats are in each cage, we can start by breaking down the information given in the problem.

1. **Rats**: 
   - There are 3 cages of rats, and they are kept in equal groups.
   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.

2. **Hamsters**: 
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.

3. **Rabbits**: 
   - A total of 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

4. **Total straw distributed**: 
   - The total amount of straw distributed among all the rodents is 160 pieces.

Now, let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \( r \). Since there are 3 cages, the total number of rats is \( 3r \).

### Step 1: Calculate straw used by rats
The total straw used by the rats can be calculated as:
\[
\text{Straw used by rats} = \text{Number of rats} \times \text{Straw per rat} = 3r \times 6 = 18r
\]

### Step 2: Calculate straw used by hamsters
Let \( h \) be the number of hamsters in each cage. The total straw used by the hamsters is:
\[
\text{Straw used by hamsters} = \text{Number of hamsters} \times \text{Straw per hamster} = 10h \times 5 = 50h
\]

### Step 3: Calculate total straw used
The total straw used by rabbits is given as 20 pieces. Therefore, the total straw distributed among all rodents is:
\[
\text{Total straw} = \text{Straw used by rats} + \text{Straw used by hamsters} + \text{Straw used by rabbits}
\]
Substituting the expressions we have:
\[
160 = 18r + 50h + 20
\]

### Step 4: Simplify the equation
Now, we can simplify the equation:
\[
160 - 20 = 18r + 50h
\]
\[
140 = 18r + 50h
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( r \) and \( h \)
Now we have the equation:
\[
18r + 50h = 140
\]

To find integer solutions for \( r \) and \( h \), we can try different values for \( h \) (the number of hamsters in each cage) and solve for \( r \).

#### Trying \( h = 0 \):
\[
18r = 140 \quad \Rightarrow \quad r = \frac{140}{18} \quad \text{(not an integer)}
\]

#### Trying \( h = 1 \):
\[
18r + 50(1) = 140 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 18r + 50 = 140 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 18r = 90 \quad \Rightarrow \quad r = 5
\]

#### Trying \( h = 2 \):
\[
18r + 50(2) = 140 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 18r + 100 = 140 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 18r = 40 \quad \Rightarrow \quad r = \frac{40}{18} \quad \text{(not an integer)}
\]

#### Trying \( h = 3 \):
\[
18r + 50(3) = 140 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 18r + 150 = 140 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 18r = -10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad r \text{ is not valid}
\]

The only valid solution we found is when \( h = 1 \) and \( r = 5 \).

   - She collected three times her initial number of cards.
   - Cards collected in the first month = \(3 \times 20 = 60\).

3. **Total Cards After the First Month**:
   - Total cards after the first month = Initial cards + Cards collected in the first month
   - Total after the first month = \(20 + 60 = 80\).

4. **Cards Collected in the Second Month**:
   - She collected 20 fewer cards than she did in the first month.
   - Cards collected in the second month = \(60 - 20 = 40\).

5. **Total Cards After the Second Month**:
   - Total cards after the second month = Total after the first month + Cards collected in the second month
   - Total after the second month = \(80 + 40 = 120\).

6. **Cards Collected in the Third Month**:
   - She collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months.
   - Combined cards from the first and second months = \(60 + 40 = 100\).
   - Cards collected in the third month = \(2 \times 100 = 200\).

7. **Total Cards After the Third Month**:
   - Total cards after the third month = Total after the second month + Cards collected in the third month
   - Total after the third month = \(120 + 200 = 320\).

Therefore, Elaine now has a total of **320 Pokémon cards**.",0.00239105,13.644428491592407,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,
gsm8k,gsm8k-199,TrustRoute,1,"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the payment from Publisher A:**
   - Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers. Since he edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B.
   - Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence.
   - Therefore, the payment from Publisher A is:
     \[
     \text{Payment from A} = 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents}
     \]

2. **Determine the payment from Publisher B:**
   - Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays. Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, Publisher B pays:
     \[
     \text{Payment from B} = 2 \times 5 \text{ cents} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence}
     \]
   - Therefore, the payment from Publisher B is:
     \[
     \text{Payment from B} = 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total payment for the week:**
   - The total payment Mark makes in a week is the sum of the payments from both publishers:
     \[
     \text{Total payment} = \text{Payment from A} + \text{Payment from B} = 2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents}
     \]

Thus, Mark makes a total of **7500 cents** in a week.",0.00252405,14.318690776824951,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,
