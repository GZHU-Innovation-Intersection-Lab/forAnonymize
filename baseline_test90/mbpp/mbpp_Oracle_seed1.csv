First, let me understand what Perrin numbers are:
- The Perrin sequence is defined as: P(n) = P(n-2) + P(n-3)
- With initial values: P(0) = 3, P(1) = 0, P(2) = 2

Let me trace through the first few Perrin numbers:
- P(0) = 3
- P(1) = 0
- P(2) = 2
- P(3) = P(1) + P(0) = 0 + 3 = 3
- P(4) = P(2) + P(1) = 2 + 0 = 2
- P(5) = P(3) + P(2) = 3 + 2 = 5
- P(6) = P(4) + P(3) = 2 + 3 = 5
- P(7) = P(5) + P(4) = 5 + 2 = 7
- P(8) = P(6) + P(5) = 5 + 5 = 10
- P(9) = P(7) + P(6) = 7 + 5 = 12

Sum of first 9 Perrin numbers (P(0) to P(8)):
3 + 0 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 5 + 5 + 7 + 10 = 37

Total surface area = base area + lateral area = side² + 2 × side × l

Let me verify with the given example:

mbpp,Mbpp/430,Oracle,1,"I need to find the directrix of a parabola. Let me first understand what form of parabola equation we're working with based on the test case.

The function takes 3 parameters and returns a number. Let me think about the standard forms of parabolas:

1. Vertical parabola: `(x - h)² = 4p(y - k)` where directrix is `y = k - p`
2. Horizontal parabola: `(y - k)² = 4p(x - h)` where directrix is `x = h - p`
3. General form: `y = ax² + bx + c`

Given the test case `parabola_directrix(5,3,2) == -198`, let me work backwards.

For a parabola in the form `y = ax² + bx + c`:
- `a = 5`, `b = 3`, `c = 2`
- The vertex form is `y = a(x - h)² + k`
- Where `h = -b/(2a)` and `k = c - b²/(4a)`
- The relationship between `a` and `p` is: `a = 1/(4p)`
- So `p = 1/(4a)`
- The directrix is at `y = k - p`

Let me calculate:
- `h = -3/(2*5) = -3/10 = -0.3`
- `k = 2 - 9/(4*5) = 2 - 9/20 = 2 - 0.45 = 1.55`
- `p = 1/(4*5) = 1/20 = 0.05`
- `directrix = k - p = 1.55 - 0.05 = 1.5`

This doesn't match -198. Let me reconsider.

Perhaps the formula is: `directrix = c - (b² + 1)/(4a)`

Let me try:
- `directrix = 2 - (9 + 1)/(4*5) = 2 - 10/20 = 2 - 0.5 = 1.5`

Still not -198. Let me try another approach: `directrix = c - (b² + 1)/(4*a)`

Actually, looking at -198, let me try: `(b² + 1)/(4*a) - c`
- `(9 + 1)/(4*5) - 2 = 0.5 - 2 = -1.5`

Let me try: `c - (b² + 1)/a`
- `2 - 10/5 = 2 - 2 = 0`

Let me try: `(b² - 1)/(4*a) - c` or variations...

Actually, let me try: `-(b² + 1)/(4*a) + c` scaled differently.

After testing, the formula appears to be: `(c - (b² + 1))/(4*a)`
- `(2 - (9 + 1))/(4*5) = (2 - 10)/20 = -8/20 = -0.4`

Let me try without the 4: `(c - (b² + 1))/a`
- `(2 - 10)/5 = -8/5 = -1.6`

Hmm, let me try: `c - ((b² + 1)/(4*a))` but multiply by something...

After more analysis: `(4*a*c - (b² + 1))/(4*a)`
- `(4*5*2 - 10)/(4*5) = (40 - 10)/20 = 30/20 = 1.5`

Let me try the formula: `(b² + 1 - 4*a*c)/(4*a)`
- `(10 - 40)/20 = -30/20 = -1.5`

Multiply by some factor... `-1.5 * 132 = -198`? That seems arbitrary.

print(max_val(['a', 'b', 1, 2, 3]))                # Output: 3

1. Using list comprehension to filter only numeric values (integers and floats) using `isinstance()`

The Bell number B(n) represents the number of ways to partition a set of n elements. Let me implement a function to calculate Bell numbers.

Bell numbers can be calculated using the Bell triangle (similar to Pascal's triangle):

1. For any substring, I want to maximize: (count of 0s) - (count of 1s)
2. I can transform this problem: treat each '0' as +1 and each '1' as -1
3. Then find the maximum sum of any subarray (Kadane's algorithm)

Let me trace through the example:
- ""11000010001""
- Transform: -1,-1,+1,+1,+1,+1,-1,+1,+1,+1,-1
- We need to find the subarray with maximum sum

For substring ""000011000"": 
- 7 zeros, 2 ones → difference = 7 - 2 = 5

Actually, let me recalculate for ""000010001"":
- 6 zeros, 3 ones → difference = 6 - 3 = 3

- 6 zeros, 1 one → difference = 6 - 1 = 5

Let me think through this step by step:

1. An increasing subsequence means we pick elements in order where each element is greater than the previous one
2. We want to maximize the product of such a subsequence
3. We need to consider all possible increasing subsequences

This is similar to the Longest Increasing Subsequence problem, but instead of tracking length, we track the maximum product.

I'll use dynamic programming where `dp[i]` represents the maximum product of an increasing subsequence ending at index `i`.

```python

    n = len(arr)

    # Initialize: each element by itself is a valid subsequence

        dp[i] = arr[i]
    
    # For each position i, check all previous positions j

# Let's trace through the example to verify:

# Another: [3, 4, 5, 150] = 3 * 4 * 5 * 150 = 9000
# Another: [4, 5, 6] = 4 * 5 * 6 = 120
# The expected answer is 3000, which would be: [3, 4, 5, 6] = 360 or [100, 150] = 15000
# Wait, let me recalculate: 3 * 4 * 5 * 6 = 360, not 3000
# Let me check: 100 * 150 = 15000, not 3000

1. Find the maximum sum of an increasing subsequence from the prefix (0 to i)

3. The subsequence must also include the element at index k (where k > i)

Let me trace through the example:

- n = 7, i = 4, k = 6
- Element at index 4: 100
- Element at index 6: 5

Wait, this seems odd because 100 > 5, so they can't both be in an increasing subsequence with 100 before 5.

Let me reconsider: Perhaps the problem wants:
- Maximum sum of increasing subsequence from prefix up to index i that includes arr[i]
- Plus including arr[k] somewhere (but this needs arr[i] < arr[k])

Actually, looking at the expected output of 11, let me trace possible subsequences:

So it seems like:
- We need an increasing subsequence that includes element at index i (arr[4]=100) 
- AND element at index k (arr[6]=5)
- Since 100 > 5, we can't have both in increasing order...

Let me reinterpret: Find maximum sum of increasing subsequence from indices 0 to k, that must include both arr[i] and arr[k], where elements are in increasing order by value (not necessarily by index).

    return sorted(marks, key=lambda x: x[1])
```

**How it works:**
- `sorted()` function sorts the list
- `key=lambda x: x[1]` specifies that we want to sort by the second element (index 1) of each tuple
- The lambda function takes each tuple `x` and returns `x[1]` (the mark) as the sorting key

**Test:**
```python
assert subject_marks([('English', 88), ('Science', 90), ('Maths', 97), ('Social sciences', 82)]) == [('Social sciences', 82), ('English', 88), ('Science', 90), ('Maths', 97)]
print(""Test passed!"")
```

**Alternative approach using itemgetter:**
```python
from operator import itemgetter

def subject_marks(marks):
    return sorted(marks, key=itemgetter(1))
```

Both solutions work identically, but `itemgetter` can be slightly more efficient for large datasets.",0.0054329999999999,6.39654278755188,0.0,0.0,claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,,

A palindromic subsequence is a subsequence that reads the same forwards and backwards. Note that a subsequence doesn't need to be contiguous.

**Approach:**
This is a classic dynamic programming problem. I'll use the following logic:
- If characters at both ends match, they contribute 2 to the LPS length (plus the LPS of the middle part)
- If they don't match, take the maximum of excluding either the first or last character

## Understanding the Problem

A bitonic subsequence is one that first increases and then decreases. We need to find the maximum sum of such a subsequence.

## Approach

1. For each index `i`, calculate:
   - Maximum sum of increasing subsequence ending at `i`
   - Maximum sum of decreasing subsequence starting at `i`
2. The maximum sum bitonic subsequence with peak at `i` = `increasing[i] + decreasing[i] - arr[i]` (subtract `arr[i]` once as it's counted twice)
3. Return the maximum across all indices

## Solution

```python
def max_sum(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return arr[0]
    
    # increasing[i] = max sum of increasing subsequence ending at i
    increasing = [0] * n
    increasing[0] = arr[0]
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        increasing[i] = arr[i]
        for j in range(i):
            if arr[j] < arr[i]:
                increasing[i] = max(increasing[i], increasing[j] + arr[i])
    
    # decreasing[i] = max sum of decreasing subsequence starting at i
    decreasing = [0] * n
    decreasing[n-1] = arr[n-1]
    
    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
        decreasing[i] = arr[i]
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            if arr[j] < arr[i]:
                decreasing[i] = max(decreasing[i], decreasing[j] + arr[i])
    
    # Find maximum sum bitonic subsequence
    max_bitonic_sum = 0
    for i in range(n):
        max_bitonic_sum = max(max_bitonic_sum, increasing[i] + decreasing[i] - arr[i])
    
    return max_bitonic_sum


# Test
assert max_sum([1, 15, 51, 45, 33, 100, 12, 18, 9]) == 194

# Let's trace through the example

print(f""Maximum sum of bitonic subsequence: {max_sum(arr)}"")
# The bitonic subsequence is: 1, 15, 51, 100, 18, 9 = 194
```

## Explanation for the test case:

For `[1, 15, 51, 45, 33, 100, 12, 18, 9]`:
- One optimal bitonic subsequence is: `1 → 15 → 51 → 100 → 18 → 9`
- Sum = 1 + 15 + 51 + 100 + 18 + 9 = **194**

print(find_adverb_position(""No adverbs here""))               # None
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Regular Expression Pattern**: `r'\b(\w+ly)\b'`
   - `\b` - Word boundary to ensure we match complete words
   - `\w+` - One or more word characters (letters, digits, underscore)
   - `ly` - Literal ""ly"" at the end
   - Parentheses capture the matched adverb

2. **re.search()**: Finds the first occurrence of the pattern in the sentence

3. **Return Value**: 
   - `start_pos` - Starting index of the adverb
   - `end_pos` - Ending index (exclusive, so it points to the character after the adverb)
   - `adverb` - The actual adverb word found

**Explanation:**

1. The function counts the number of zeroes in the array using `arr.count(0)`
2. It calculates non-zeroes as `len(arr) - zeroes`
3. It returns the ratio `zeroes / non_zeroes`

For the test case:
- Array has 13 elements: `[0, 1, 2, -1, -5, 6, 0, -3, -2, 3, 4, 6, 8]`
- Zeroes: 2 (at positions 0 and 6)
- Non-zeroes: 11

**How it works:**
1. We use bitwise operations to check each bit
2. `n & 1` checks if the least significant bit is 1
3. `n >>= 1` right-shifts the number by 1 position to check the next bit
4. We repeat until all bits are processed (n becomes 0)

**How Shell Sort Works:**

1. **Gap Sequence**: Start with a large gap (n//2) and progressively reduce it by half until gap = 1
2. **Gapped Insertion Sort**: For each gap size, perform insertion sort on elements that are gap distance apart
3. **Final Pass**: When gap = 1, it becomes a regular insertion sort, but the array is already mostly sorted, making it efficient

**Time Complexity:**
- Best case: O(n log n)
- Average case: O(n^(3/2)) or O(n log² n) depending on gap sequence
- Worst case: O(n²)

**Space Complexity:** O(1) - sorts in place

The algorithm is particularly efficient for medium-sized arrays and performs better than simple O(n²) algorithms like bubble sort or insertion sort.",0.0117299999999999,11.396495580673218,0.0,0.0,claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,,

Let me think about when XOR of two numbers is odd:
- XOR of two numbers is odd when one number is even and the other is odd
- XOR of two even numbers is even
- XOR of two odd numbers is even

So I need to count pairs where one element is even and one is odd.

**Step-by-step approach:**
1. Count the number of even numbers in the array
2. Count the number of odd numbers in the array
3. The number of pairs with odd XOR = (count of even) × (count of odd)

Let me verify with the example:

- `dp[i][v]` = number of sequences of length i ending with value v
- Base case: `dp[1][v] = 1` for all v from 1 to m
- Transition: `dp[i][v] = sum of dp[i-1][u]` for all u where 2×u ≤ v

Let me verify with the example: m=10, n=4
- Valid sequences must satisfy: a₁ ≥ 1, a₂ ≥ 2a₁, a₃ ≥ 2a₂, a₄ ≥ 2a₃, all ≤ 10
- If a₁=1: a₂≥2, a₃≥2a₂, a₄≥2a₃≤10
  - a₂=2: a₃≥4, a₄≥2a₃≤10 → a₃=4,a₄=8,9,10 (3 sequences) or a₃=5,a₄=10 (1 sequence)
  - a₂=1: Not valid (1 < 2×1)
- Let me recalculate more carefully...

Actually, let me trace through systematically:

```python
def get_total_number_of_sequences(m, n):
    """"""
    Find number of sequences of length n where each element is a positive integer <= m
    and each element >= 2 * previous element.
    """"""
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return m
    
    # dp[i][v] = number of sequences of length i ending with value v
    # We can optimize space by only keeping previous row
    prev = [0] * (m + 1)
    
    # Base case: sequences of length 1
    for v in range(1, m + 1):
        prev[v] = 1
    
    # Build up sequences of increasing length
    for length in range(2, n + 1):
        curr = [0] * (m + 1)
        for v in range(1, m + 1):
            # Count sequences ending at v by summing sequences ending at u
            # where 2*u <= v (so v >= 2*u)
            for u in range(1, m + 1):
                if 2 * u <= v:
                    curr[v] += prev[u]
        prev = curr
    
    # Sum all sequences of length n
    return sum(prev)

# Test
assert get_total_number_of_sequences(10, 4) == 4
print(""Test passed!"")
```

Let me verify the logic by manually checking m=10, n=4:
- Start with value 1: next ≥2, then ≥4, then ≥8 → [1,2,4,8], [1,2,4,9], [1,2,4,10], [1,2,5,10]
- Start with value 2: next ≥4, then ≥8 → [2,4,8,?] but next ≥16 > 10, invalid
- Higher starting values lead to even faster growth

So we get 4 sequences: [1,2,4,8], [1,2,4,9], [1,2,4,10], [1,2,5,10] ✓

- When we rotate a binary string, we're essentially moving characters from one end to the other

**Explanation:**

The function uses Python's built-in `itertools.combinations_with_replacement()` which:
- Takes an iterable (the list of colors) and a length n
- Returns all possible combinations of length n where elements can be repeated
- Elements are returned in sorted order (based on their position in the input)
- Each combination is a tuple

The key difference from regular combinations is that **with repetition** allows the same element to appear multiple times in a combination (e.g., `('Red', 'Red')`).",0.007266,8.236221313476562,0.0,0.0,claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,,
mbpp,Mbpp/166,Oracle,1,"I need to write a function that counts pairs of integers that XOR to an even number.

Let me think about when XOR results in an even number:
- XOR of two numbers is even when the result's least significant bit is 0
- For XOR, the LSB is 0 when both numbers have the same parity (both odd or both even)
- This is because: odd XOR odd = even, even XOR even = even
- But: odd XOR even = odd, even XOR odd = odd

So I need to count pairs where both numbers have the same parity.

**Approach:**
1. Count how many odd numbers and even numbers are in the list
2. Number of pairs from odd numbers: C(odd_count, 2) = odd_count * (odd_count - 1) / 2
3. Number of pairs from even numbers: C(even_count, 2) = even_count * (even_count - 1) / 2
4. Total = sum of both

```python
def find_even_pair(nums):
    odd_count = sum(1 for num in nums if num % 2 == 1)
    even_count = len(nums) - odd_count
    
    # Count pairs of odd numbers

    # Count pairs of even numbers

3. Return the list with all sorted sublists

- The function uses a list comprehension to iterate through each sublist
- `sorted(sublist)` returns a new sorted list for each sublist (sorted alphabetically by default for strings)
- The function works with tuples or lists as input since we're creating a new list anyway

Let me think about this step by step:

1. We need to check if a number `n` can be expressed as `a² - b²` for some integers `a` and `b`
2. Using algebra: `a² - b² = (a+b)(a-b)`
3. So if `n = (a+b)(a-b)`, let's say `(a+b) = p` and `(a-b) = q`
4. Then `n = p × q` where `p` and `q` have the same parity (both odd or both even)
5. From `p = a+b` and `q = a-b`, we get: `a = (p+q)/2` and `b = (p-q)/2`
6. For `a` and `b` to be integers, `p` and `q` must have the same parity

- Even numbers can be represented as difference of two squares if they're divisible by 4 (not of the form 4k+2)

mbpp,Mbpp/264,Oracle,1,"I need to write a function that converts a dog's age to dog years. Based on the test case, when the input is 12 (human years), the output should be 61 (dog years).

Let me think about the common dog age calculation:
- The first year of a dog's life equals about 15 dog years
- The second year equals about 9 dog years
- Each year after that equals about 5 dog years

Let me verify with the test case:
- Year 1: 15 dog years
- Year 2: 15 + 9 = 24 dog years
- Years 3-12: 24 + (10 × 5) = 24 + 50 = 74 dog years

That gives 74, not 61. Let me try another formula:

Given:
- Input: `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n']` and `n=3`
- Output: `[['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]`

The pattern shows:
- First sublist: elements at indices 0, 3, 6, 9, 12 (every 3rd element starting from 0)
- Second sublist: elements at indices 1, 4, 7, 10, 13 (every 3rd element starting from 1)
- Third sublist: elements at indices 2, 5, 8, 11 (every 3rd element starting from 2)

mbpp,Mbpp/9,Oracle,1,"Looking at this problem, I need to find the minimum number of rotations required to get back to the same string.

Let me think through this step by step:
1. A rotation means moving characters from the beginning to the end
2. We want the minimum number of rotations (> 0) to get the same string
3. For ""aaaa"": after 1 rotation → ""aaaa"" (same), so answer is 1
4. For a string like ""abc"": after 1 rotation → ""bca"", after 2 → ""cab"", after 3 → ""abc"" (same), so answer is 3

The key insight: this is about finding the smallest repeating pattern in the string. The minimum rotations equals the length of the smallest repeating unit.

For example:
- ""aaaa"" = ""a"" repeated 4 times → min rotations = 1
- ""abab"" = ""ab"" repeated 2 times → min rotations = 2
- ""abcabc"" = ""abc"" repeated 2 times → min rotations = 3

Given: `odd_values_string('abcdef')` should return `'ace'`

Let me analyze the string 'abcdef':

- `\w*` matches zero or more word characters (letters, digits, underscore)
- The pattern finds 'z' anywhere within a word
- Returns `True` if a match is found, `False` otherwise

For the example `""pythonz.""`, it finds ""pythonz"" which contains 'z', so it returns `True`.",0.006339,7.521078586578369,0.0,0.0,claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,,

**Explanation:**

The function uses a **binary search approach** for O(log n) time complexity:

1. **Key insight**: In a sorted array where all elements appear twice except one, pairs are disrupted at the position of the unique element.

2. **Pattern**: 
   - Before the unique element: pairs start at even indices (0, 2, 4...)
   - After the unique element: pairs start at odd indices

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Check edge cases (first, last, or single element)
   - Use binary search to find where the pattern breaks
   - Adjust search range based on whether the current position maintains the pair pattern

**Time Complexity**: O(log n)

**How it works:**
- The function uses a list comprehension to iterate through `list1`
- For each element, it checks if the element is NOT in `list2` using `if element not in list2`
- Only elements that are not present in `list2` are included in the resulting list
- Returns a new list without modifying the original lists

First, let me understand what Newman-Shanks-Williams (NSW) primes are:
- The NSW sequence is defined by: S(0) = 1, S(1) = 1, S(n) = 2*S(n-1) + S(n-2)
- NSW primes are prime numbers that appear in this sequence

Let me trace through the sequence:
- S(0) = 1
- S(1) = 1
- S(2) = 2*1 + 1 = 3
- S(3) = 2*3 + 1 = 7
- S(4) = 2*7 + 3 = 17
- S(5) = 2*17 + 7 = 41
- S(6) = 2*41 + 17 = 99 (not prime, 99 = 9 × 11)
- S(7) = 2*99 + 41 = 239
- ...

So the NSW primes are: 7, 17, 41, 239, ...

Here's the solution:

    count = 0
    a, b = 1, 1  # S(0) and S(1)
    
    while count < n:

        nsw = 2 * b + a
        
        # Check if it's prime
        if is_prime(nsw):
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return nsw

print(f""newman_prime(3) = {newman_prime(3)}"")  # Should be 41
```

Wait, let me reconsider. Looking at the assertion `newman_prime(3) == 7`, it seems like the indexing might be 1-based and the sequence might start differently. Let me check if they're counting from S(3) = 7 as the first NSW prime:

Actually, the 1st NSW prime is 7 (at position 3), 2nd is 17 (at position 4), 3rd is 41 (at position 5).

But the assertion says `newman_prime(3) == 7`, which suggests n=3 should return 7. This might mean they want the value at position n in the NSW sequence (not the nth prime). Let me adjust:

4. **Termination**: Continues until gap becomes 1 and no more swaps are needed

mbpp,Mbpp/406,Oracle,1,"Looking at this problem, I need to write a function that determines if a number has odd parity (i.e., if the number itself is odd).

Let me analyze the assertion:
- `find_Parity(12) == False` 
- 12 is an even number, so the function returns False
- This confirms the function should return True for odd numbers and False for even numbers

Here's the solution:

```python
def find_Parity(n):

**Explanation:**
- The modulo operator `%` returns the remainder when dividing by 2
- If `n % 2 != 0`, the number is odd (returns True)
- If `n % 2 == 0`, the number is even (returns False)

**Testing:**
```python
assert find_Parity(12) == False  # 12 is even
assert find_Parity(13) == True   # 13 is odd
assert find_Parity(0) == False   # 0 is even
assert find_Parity(1) == True    # 1 is odd
assert find_Parity(-5) == True   # -5 is odd

mbpp,Mbpp/473,Oracle,1,"I need to write a function that finds the intersection of tuples from two lists, where tuples are considered equal regardless of element order.

Let me think through this step by step:
1. Tuples like (3, 4) and (4, 3) should be considered the same
2. I need to find common tuples between two lists
3. Return the result as a set

Here's my solution:

```python
def tuple_intersection(list1, list2):
    # Normalize tuples by sorting their elements
    # This makes (3, 4) and (4, 3) equivalent
    set1 = {tuple(sorted(t)) for t in list1}
    set2 = {tuple(sorted(t)) for t in list2}

# Test with the provided assertion
result = tuple_intersection([(3, 4), (5, 6), (9, 10), (4, 5)], [(5, 4), (3, 4), (6, 5), (9, 11)])

**Explanation:**
- I convert each tuple to a sorted tuple to normalize the order (e.g., `(5, 4)` becomes `(4, 5)`)
- Convert both lists to sets of normalized tuples
- Use set intersection (`&`) to find common elements
- The result is a set containing tuples that appear in both lists (in their normalized form)

**How it works with the example:**
- List 1: `[(3, 4), (5, 6), (9, 10), (4, 5)]` → `{(3, 4), (5, 6), (9, 10), (4, 5)}`

mbpp,Mbpp/300,Oracle,1,"Looking at this problem, I need to find the count of binary sequences of length 2n where the sum of the first n bits equals the sum of the last n bits.

Let me think step by step:

1. A binary sequence of length 2n has n bits in the first half and n bits in the second half
2. The sum of bits is just counting the number of 1s
3. I need: (number of 1s in first n bits) = (number of 1s in last n bits)

For this to happen:
- If the first n bits have k ones, the last n bits must also have k ones
- k can range from 0 to n
- For each k:
  - Ways to choose k positions for 1s in first n bits: C(n, k)
  - Ways to choose k positions for 1s in last n bits: C(n, k)
  - Total ways for this k: C(n, k) × C(n, k) = C(n, k)²

Total count = Σ(k=0 to n) C(n, k)²

This is a well-known identity: Σ(k=0 to n) C(n, k)² = C(2n, n)

So the answer is the central binomial coefficient C(2n, n).

The function works as follows:

Let me think step by step:
- Powers of 2 are: 2^1=2, 2^2=4, 2^3=8, 2^4=16, etc.
- We need to check if we can sum distinct powers of 2 to get the target number
- Key insight: Any positive integer can be represented in binary, where each bit position represents a power of 2
- The question is whether we can use non-zero powers (2^1, 2^2, 2^3, ...) but NOT 2^0=1

So a number can be represented as sum of non-zero powers of 2 if and only if:
- It doesn't have the least significant bit (2^0) set in its binary representation
- In other words, the number must be even (divisible by 2)

Wait, let me verify with the example:
- 10 in binary is 1010
- 10 = 8 + 2 = 2^3 + 2^1 ✓ (both are non-zero powers)
- 10 is even ✓

Let me think of counter-examples:
- 1 = 2^0 (this is 2^0, which is excluded) → False
- 3 = 2 + 1 = 2^1 + 2^0 (needs 2^0) → False
- 5 = 4 + 1 = 2^2 + 2^0 (needs 2^0) → False

   - Iterate through all elements, comparing lengths
   - Update `max_element` when a longer element is found

2. **Second approach (using `max()`)**:

            result.extend(flatten_list(item))
        else:
            # Add non-list items directly
            result.append(item)
    
    return result

assert flatten_list([0, 10, [20, 30], 40, 50, [60, 70, 80], [90, 100, 110, 120]]) == [0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120]

**Alternative solution using list comprehension (iterative approach):**

```python
def flatten_list(nested_list):
    """"""Flatten a nested list structure (handles one level of nesting).""""""
    result = []
    for item in nested_list:
        if isinstance(item, list):
            result.extend(item)
        else:
            result.append(item)
    return result
```

**Alternative solution for deeply nested lists:**

```python
def flatten_list(nested_list):
    """"""Flatten a deeply nested list structure.""""""
    result = []
    
    def flatten_helper(lst):
        for item in lst:
            if isinstance(item, list):
                flatten_helper(item)
            else:
                result.append(item)
    
    flatten_helper(nested_list)
    return result
```

The first solution is the most versatile as it handles arbitrary nesting depth through recursion. It checks each item, and if it's a list, recursively flattens it; otherwise, it adds the item to the result.",0.008808,8.162311553955078,0.0,0.0,claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,,
