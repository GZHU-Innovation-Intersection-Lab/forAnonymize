1. **Weight of Chocolate Bars**:
   - Number of chocolate bars = 25
   - Weight of each chocolate bar = 40g
   - Total weight of chocolate bars = Number of chocolate bars × Weight of each chocolate bar

1. **Cost of the jacket**: $30
2. **Cost of 2 pairs of shoes**: 2 pairs × $20/pair = $40

Now, we add the costs together:
- Total cost = Cost of jacket + Cost of shoes
- Total cost = $30 + $40 = $70

Next, we calculate how much money Sara has after babysitting and her initial savings.

1. **Earnings from babysitting**: 
   - She babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time.
   - Total earnings from babysitting = 4 × $5 = $20

2. **Initial savings**: $10

Now, we add her babysitting earnings to her initial savings:
- Total money after babysitting = Initial savings + Earnings from babysitting
- Total money after babysitting = $10 + $20 = $30

Next, we find out how much more money Sara needs to afford the jacket and shoes:
- Additional money needed = Total cost - Total money after babysitting
- Additional money needed = $70 - $30 = $40

Now, we calculate how much Sara earns from mowing the lawn:
- She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn.

To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the additional $40, we set up the equation:
- Let \( x \) be the number of times she mows the lawn.
- Earnings from mowing = $4 × \( x \)

We need to solve for \( x \):
- $4 × \( x \) = $40
- \( x \) = $40 / $4
- \( x \) = 10

gsm8k,gsm8k-211,TrustRoute-NoCostAware,1,"Let \( r \) be the number of red chickens and \( w \) be the number of white chickens. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, so the total egg production from red chickens is \( 3r \).
2. The white chickens produce 5 eggs a day, so the total egg production from white chickens is \( 5w \).
3. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs a day, which gives us the equation:
   \[
   3r + 5w = 42
   \]
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which gives us the equation:
   \[
   w = r + 2
   \]

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation. Replacing \( w \) in the first equation:

\[
3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
\]

Expanding this equation:

\[
3r + 5r + 10 = 42
\]

Combining like terms:

\[
8r + 10 = 42
\]

Now, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[
8r = 32
\]

Dividing both sides by 8:

\[
r = 4
\]

Now that we have the number of red chickens, we can find the number of white chickens using the equation \( w = r + 2 \):

\[
w = 4 + 2 = 6
\]

Thus, Jerry has:

- **Red chickens**: \( 4 \)
- **White chickens**: \( 6 \)

To verify, we can check the total egg production:

- Eggs from red chickens: \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \)
- Eggs from white chickens: \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \)
- Total eggs: \( 12 + 30 = 42 \)

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of red chickens Jerry has is:

1. **Initial number of fries Griffin had**: 24 fries.

2. **Fries taken by Kyle**: Kyle took 5 fries.

   \[
   \text{Fries left with Griffin after Kyle took some} = 24 - 5 = 19 \text{ fries}
   \]

3. **Fries taken by Billy**: Billy took twice as many as Kyle. Since Kyle took 5 fries, Billy took:

   \[
   \text{Fries taken by Billy} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ fries}
   \]

   Now, let's calculate how many fries Griffin has after both Kyle and Billy took fries:

   \[
   \text{Fries left with Griffin after Billy took some} = 19 - 10 = 9 \text{ fries}
   \]

4. **Fries taken by Colby**: Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken. Since Kyle took 5 fries, Colby took:

   \[
   \text{Fries taken by Colby} = 5 - 3 = 2 \text{ fries}
   \]

   Now, let's calculate how many fries Griffin has after Colby took some:

   \[

- Let \( B_a \) be the number of bananas Andrea has.
- Let \( B_j \) be the number of bananas Jamal has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal:

2. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal:

3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples:
   \[
   B_j = A_j + 4

We know that Andrea has 52 apples:
\[
A_a = 52

Now, we can substitute \( A_a \) into the first equation to find \( A_j \):
\[
52 = A_j + 8
\]
\[
A_j = 52 - 8 = 44
\]

Now that we have \( A_j \), we can find \( B_j \) using the third equation:
\[
B_j = A_j + 4 = 44 + 4 = 48
\]

Next, we can find \( B_a \) using the second equation:
\[
B_a = \frac{1}{2} B_j = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24

Now we have:
- Andrea's apples: \( A_a = 52 \)

   \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
   \[

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation. 

Substituting \( R \) in the second equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
\]

Now, let's simplify the right side:
\[

   \]

2. There are twice as many chickens as cows:
   \[
   h = 2c

4. **Yellow Snake**: 10 pounds more than the pink frog = 50 + 10 = 60 pounds
5. **Red Bird**: 20 pounds less than the pink frog = 50 - 20 = 30 pounds

Now, let's calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal:

1. **Cost of mini-golf**: 
   - Each round of mini-golf costs $5.
   - If Morgan invites \( x \) friends, then there will be \( x + 1 \) people (Morgan + her friends).
   - Total cost for mini-golf: 
     \[
     5 \times (x + 1)
     \]

2. **Cost of arcade tokens**: 
   - Each person gets $5 in arcade tokens.
   - Total cost for arcade tokens:
     \[
     5 \times (x + 1)
     \]

3. **Cost of go-karts**: 
   - Each ride costs $10, and they want to ride twice.
   - Total cost for go-karts:
     \[
     10 \times 2 \times (x + 1) = 20 \times (x + 1)
     \]

4. **Total cost**: 
   - Now we can sum up all the costs:
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost of mini-golf} + \text{Cost of arcade tokens} + \text{Cost of go-karts}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = 5(x + 1) + 5(x + 1) + 20(x + 1)
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = (5 + 5 + 20)(x + 1) = 30(x + 1)
     \]

5. **Setting up the budget equation**:
   - Morgan has a budget of $90, so we set up the equation:
     \[
     30(x + 1) \leq 90
     \]

6. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   - Divide both sides by 30:
     \[
     x + 1 \leq 3
     \]
   - Subtract 1 from both sides:
     \[
     x \leq 2
     \]

This means Morgan can invite a maximum of 2 friends.

1. **Axel's silver pesos**: 50
2. **Axel's gold pesos**: 80

Now, let's calculate Anna's pesos:

- **Anna's silver pesos**: Since Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, she has:
  \[
  2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ silver pesos}
  \]

- **Anna's gold pesos**: Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has:
  \[

3. **Cost of Disney Plus**: $10 per month

Since Tim bundles Hulu and Disney Plus, he gets a 20% discount on the combined cost of these two services.

First, calculate the combined cost of Hulu and Disney Plus without the discount:
- Combined cost = $10 (Hulu) + $10 (Disney Plus) = $20

Now, apply the 20% discount:
- Discount amount = 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4
- Discounted cost = $20 - $4 = $16

Now, add the cost of Netflix to the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus:
- Total cost of streaming services = $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu + Disney Plus) = $26

Now, compare this total cost to the cable package:
- Cost of cable = $60
- Cost of streaming services = $26

3. He did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
4. After these activities, he had 2,000 steps left to take.

Now, let's calculate the total number of steps Elliott has taken before his jog:

- Steps from walking to and from school: 5,000 steps

From the problem, we know the following:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.

- Therefore, the total number of apples Joanne gathers is:

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box:
\[
\text{Total oranges from Ashley} = 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ oranges}
\]

Next, we find out how many oranges Brianne brought. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley:
\[
\text{Total oranges from Brianne} = 50 + 20 = 70 \text{ oranges}
\]

Now, we can find the total number of oranges that both Brianne and Ashley have together:
\[

\]

Each Greek orange pie requires 3 oranges. To find out how many pies they can make, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed for one pie:

gsm8k,gsm8k-499,TrustRoute-NoCostAware,1,"To determine how many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up equations for the total cost of each venue based on the number of guests, \( x \).

1. **Cost of the first venue**:
   - Flat fee: $200
   - Food cost: $5 per person
   - Total cost for the first venue: 
   \[
   \text{Cost}_1 = 200 + 5x
   \]

2. **Cost of the second venue**:
   - Charge per person: $25 (which includes food)
   - Total cost for the second venue:
   \[
   \text{Cost}_2 = 25x
   \]

Now, we want to find the number of guests \( x \) where the costs are equal:
\[
200 + 5x = 25x
\]

Next, we can solve for \( x \):

1. Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
   \[
   200 = 25x - 5x
   \]
   \[
   200 = 20x
   \]

2. Divide both sides by 20:

gsm8k,gsm8k-500,TrustRoute-NoCostAware,1,"Let's denote the number of insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi as \( L \), \( D \), and \( B \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. The total number of insects collected by all three is 43:
   \[
   L + D + B = 43
   \]

2. Lily found 7 more insects than David:
   \[
   L = D + 7
   \]

3. David found half of what Bodhi found:
   \[
   D = \frac{1}{2} B
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( L \) and \( D \) into the first equation.

First, substitute \( D = \frac{1}{2} B \) into \( L = D + 7 \):
\[
L = \frac{1}{2} B + 7
\]

Now we can substitute both \( L \) and \( D \) into the total insects equation:
\[
\left(\frac{1}{2} B + 7\right) + \left(\frac{1}{2} B\right) + B = 43
\]

Combine the terms:
\[
\frac{1}{2} B + 7 + \frac{1}{2} B + B = 43
\]
\[
\frac{1}{2} B + \frac{1}{2} B + B + 7 = 43
\]
\[
2B + 7 = 43
\]

Now, subtract 7 from both sides:
\[
2B = 36
\]

Divide by 2:
\[
B = 18
\]

Now that we have \( B \), we can find \( D \):
\[
D = \frac{1}{2} B = \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9
\]

Finally, we can find \( L \):
\[
L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16
\]

Thus, the number of insects that Lily found is \( \boxed{16} \).",0.0035331500000000005,16.504189252853394,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,

1. **Red Tulips:**
   - Jackson can fit 6 red tulips in a row.
   - He has 36 red tulips.
   - To find the number of rows of red tulips, we divide the total number of red tulips by the number of tulips per row:
     \[
     \text{Number of rows of red tulips} = \frac{36 \text{ red tulips}}{6 \text{ tulips per row}} = 6 \text{ rows}
     \]

2. **Blue Tulips:**

According to the problem:

1. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs:
   \[
   S_O = C_O - 2
   \]
   where \( S_O \) is the number of sofas Ophelia has.

2. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia:
   \[
   C_J = 3C_O
   \]

3. Ophelia has 20 sofas:
   \[
   S_O = 20
   \]

From the first equation, we can express \( C_O \) in terms of \( S_O \):
\[
C_O = S_O + 2
\]
Substituting \( S_O = 20 \):
\[
C_O = 20 + 2 = 22
\]

Now, we can find the number of chairs Jenna has using the second equation:
\[
C_J = 3C_O = 3 \times 22 = 66
\]

Next, we can find the number of sofas Jenna has. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs:
\[
S_J = C_J - 2 = 66 - 2 = 64

Now we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have:

- Total sofas:

- Total chairs:
  \[
  C_O + C_J = 22 + 66 = 88

Finally, the total number of sofas and chairs combined is:
\[

   M = 80 - 20 = 60
   \]

3. Richie also scored 45 more goals than Anna:
   \[
   80 = A + 45
   \]
   From this, we can solve for \( A \):
   \[
   A = 80 - 45 = 35
   \]

Now we have the number of goals scored by each teenager:
- Richie: 80 goals
- Mark: 60 goals
- Anna: 35 goals

To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add their goals together:
\[
\text{Total goals} = R + M + A = 80 + 60 + 35
\]
Calculating this gives:
\[
\text{Total goals} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175

1. **Total Money Available**: Peter has $70.

2. **Days of Spending**: Peter plans to spend money from Sunday to Saturday, which is 7 days.

3. **Daily Spending**: Since he wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week, we can calculate his daily spending:
   \[
   \text{Daily Spending} = \frac{\text{Total Money}}{\text{Number of Days}} = \frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day}
   \]

4. **Spending from Sunday to Wednesday**: For the first four days (Sunday to Wednesday), he buys wooden action figures that cost $5 each. The total amount he spends from Sunday to Wednesday is:
   \[
   \text{Total Spent from Sunday to Wednesday} = 4 \text{ days} \times 10 \text{ dollars/day} = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   The number of wooden action figures he buys is:
   \[
   \text{Number of Wooden Action Figures} = \frac{\text{Total Spent from Sunday to Wednesday}}{\text{Cost per Wooden Action Figure}} = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ wooden action figures}
   \]

5. **Spending from Thursday to Saturday**: For the remaining three days (Thursday to Saturday), he buys plastic action figures that cost $2 each. The total amount he spends from Thursday to Saturday is:
   \[
   \text{Total Spent from Thursday to Saturday} = 3 \text{ days} \times 10 \text{ dollars/day} = 30 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   The number of plastic action figures he buys is:
   \[
   \text{Number of Plastic Action Figures} = \frac{\text{Total Spent from Thursday to Saturday}}{\text{Cost per Plastic Action Figure}} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ plastic action figures}
   \]

6. **Total Action Figures**: Finally, we can calculate the total number of action figures Peter will have by adding the wooden and plastic action figures:
   \[
   \text{Total Action Figures} = \text{Number of Wooden Action Figures} + \text{Number of Plastic Action Figures} = 8 + 15 = 23

1. **Initial height of the beanstalk**: 4 feet
2. **Height of the window**: 20 feet
3. **Growth pattern**: The beanstalk doubles its height every day.

Let's denote the height of the beanstalk on day \( n \) as \( H(n) \). The height can be expressed as:

\[
H(n) = 4 \times 2^n
\]

We need to find the smallest integer \( n \) such that:

\[

Substituting the expression for \( H(n) \):

\[
4 \times 2^n > 20
\]

Dividing both sides by 4:

\[

\]

Now, we need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( 2^n > 5 \). We can evaluate powers of 2:

- \( 2^1 = 2 \) (not greater than 5)
- \( 2^2 = 4 \) (not greater than 5)
- \( 2^3 = 8 \) (greater than 5)

gsm8k,gsm8k-639,TrustRoute-NoCostAware,1,"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole in cubic feet.

The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) can be calculated using the formula:

\[
V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}
\]

Given:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

Now, we can calculate the volume:

\[
V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet}
\]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot of earth. Therefore, to find the total time \( T \) it takes to dig the entire hole, we multiply the volume by the time per cubic foot:

\[
T = V \times \text{time per cubic foot} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds/cubic foot}

Calculating this gives:

\[
T = 72 \times 3 = 216 \, \text{seconds}

   - Tim's current salary is $20,000 per month.
   - The raise is 5% of his monthly salary:
     \[
     \text{Raise} = 0.05 \times 20000 = 1000

2. **Cost of dress pants**:
   - Number of dress pants = 10
   - Cost per dress pant = 1/5 of the cost of a suit = $750 / 5 = $150

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet:
   \[
   T = R + 7
   \]

2. The combined ages of the twins and triplets is 44. Since there is one set of twins (2 twins) and one set of triplets (3 triplets), we can express this as:
   \[
   2T + 3R = 44
   \]

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation. Replacing \( T \) in the second equation gives us:
\[
2(R + 7) + 3R = 44
\]

Expanding this:
\[
2R + 14 + 3R = 44
\]

Combining like terms:
\[
5R + 14 = 44

Now, we can solve for \( R \):
\[

\[

\]
\[
R = 6

gsm8k,gsm8k-689,TrustRoute-NoCostAware,1,"To find out how much 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost Manolo, we first need to determine the cost of the candies.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the lollipops:**
   - Each lollipop costs $0.40.
   - Manolo bought 5 lollipops.
   - Total cost of lollipops = 5 lollipops × $0.40/lollipop = $2.00.

2. **Determine the total cost of the candies:**
   - Manolo's total expenditure for 5 lollipops and 4 candies is $3.20.
   - We already calculated the cost of the lollipops as $2.00.
   - Let \( C \) be the total cost of the candies.
   - Therefore, we have:
     \[
     2.00 + C = 3.20
     \]
   - Solving for \( C \):
     \[
     C = 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20
     \]
   - The total cost of the 4 candies is $1.20.

3. **Calculate the cost of one candy:**
   - Let \( p \) be the price of one candy.
   - Since 4 candies cost $1.20:
     \[
     4p = 1.20
     \]
   - Solving for \( p \):
     \[
     p = \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30
     \]
   - Each candy costs $0.30.

4. **Calculate the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies:**
   - Cost of 10 lollipops:
     \[
     10 \times 0.40 = 4.00
     \]
   - Cost of 10 candies:
     \[

2. **Blue Squares**: There are 4 more blue squares than red squares. Therefore, the number of blue squares is:
   \[
   \text{Blue Squares} = \text{Red Squares} + 4 = 14 + 4 = 18
   \]

3. **Green Squares**: There are 6 more green squares than blue squares. Therefore, the number of green squares is:
   \[
   \text{Green Squares} = \text{Blue Squares} + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24

4. **White Squares**: There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares. Therefore, the number of white squares is:
   \[
   \text{White Squares} = \text{Green Squares} - 12 = 24 - 12 = 12

Topher's shoe length is 8 feet and 4 inches. We know that:
- 1 foot = 12 inches

So, we convert 8 feet to inches:
\[ 
8 \text{ feet} = 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ inches} 
\]

Now, adding the 4 inches:
\[ 
\text{Total length of Topher's shoe} = 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} 
\]

Next, we set up the equation based on the information given in the problem. Let \( b \) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. This can be expressed as:
\[ 
\text{Length of Topher's shoe} = 9b + 10 
\]

We know that the length of Topher's shoe is 100 inches, so we can write the equation:
\[ 
100 = 9b + 10 
\]

Now, we can solve for \( b \):
1. Subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 
100 - 10 = 9b 
\]
\[ 
90 = 9b 
\]

2. Divide both sides by 9:

   - The average driving speed is 50 miles per hour.
   - The total time for the trip is 6 hours, and they spent 1.5 hours hiking. Therefore, the time spent driving is:
     \[
     \text{Driving time} = 6 \text{ hours} - 1.5 \text{ hours} = 4.5 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Distance Driven**:
   - The distance driven can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
     \]
   - Thus, the distance driven is:
     \[
     \text{Distance driven} = 50 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4.5 \text{ hours} = 225 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Hiking Speed**:
   - The hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half of their driving speed. Half of the driving speed is:
     \[
     \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ miles/hour}
     \]
   - Therefore, the hiking speed is:
     \[
     25 \text{ miles/hour} - 5 \text{ miles/hour} = 20 \text{ miles/hour}
     \]

4. **Distance Hiked**:
   - The distance hiked can also be calculated using the distance formula:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
     \]
   - Thus, the distance hiked is:
     \[
     \text{Distance hiked} = 20 \text{ miles/hour} \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles}
     \]

5. **Total Distance to Vacation Spot**:
   - The total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:
     \[
     \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance driven} + \text{Distance hiked} = 225 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 255 \text{ miles}
     \]

Thus, the distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot is **255 miles**.",0.00279145,17.192227363586426,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,
gsm8k,gsm8k-780,TrustRoute-NoCostAware,1,"To determine the difference between Ava's and Emma's scores, we can set up the scoring system based on the information provided.

Let:
- \( e \) = number of enemies Emma jumps on
- \( b \) = number of berries Emma collects
- \( t \) = time left (in seconds) for Emma when she finishes the level

From the problem, we know:
- Ava jumps on \( e + 8 \) enemies.
- Ava collects \( b + 3 \) berries.
- Ava finishes the level \( t - 4 \) seconds slower than Emma, so she has \( t - 4 \) seconds left.

Now, we can calculate the scores for both players.

**Emma's score:**
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Emma}} = 10e + 5b + 30t
\]

**Ava's score:**
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10(e + 8) + 5(b + 3) + 30(t - 4)
\]

Now, let's simplify Ava's score:
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10e + 80 + 5b + 15 + 30t - 120
\]
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10e + 5b + 30t - 25
\]

Now we can find the difference between Ava's and Emma's scores:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} - \text{Score}_{\text{Emma}}
\]
Substituting the scores:
\[
\text{Difference} = (10e + 5b + 30t - 25) - (10e + 5b + 30t)
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = -25
\]

Thus, the difference between Ava's and Emma's scores is \(-25\). This means Ava's score is 25 points lower than Emma's score. 

So, the final answer is:
\[
\text{The difference between their two scores is } 25 \text{ points, with Emma winning.}

1. **Calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:**
   - Third graders: 340 out of 500 passed.
   - Fourth graders: 40 out of 100 passed.
   - Fifth graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders.

   First, we need to find the pass rate for the fourth graders:
   \[
   \text{Pass rate for fourth graders} = \frac{40}{100} = 0.4 \text{ or } 40\%
   \]
   Therefore, the pass rate for fifth graders is:
   \[

   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of students who passed:**
   \[
   \text{Total passed} = \text{Passed third graders} + \text{Passed fourth graders} + \text{Passed fifth graders}

1. **Calculate the total number of branches climbed**:
   Felix charges $0.25 per branch. If he made $105 in total, we can find the total number of branches climbed by dividing the total earnings by the cost per branch.

   \[
   \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25}

- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt (in ounces).
- Since she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \).
- Since she uses twice as much oil as salt, the amount of oil is \( 2s \).

According to the problem:

1. Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as she did Joe's, which means she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.
2. Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's, which means she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.

Now, we can calculate how much Tasha earned from mowing lawns:

- Joe paid Tasha $6 for mowing his lawn \( x \) times, so she earned:
  \[
  \text{Earnings from Joe} = 6x
  \]

- Let's assume Tasha charges the same amount for mowing Kamala's and Alba's lawns as she does for Joe's. Therefore, her earnings from mowing Kamala's lawn would be:
  \[
  \text{Earnings from Kamala} = 6 \times 3x = 18x
  \]

- Similarly, her earnings from mowing Alba's lawn would be:
  \[
  \text{Earnings from Alba} = 6 \times 5x = 30x
  \]

Now, we can sum up all her earnings from mowing lawns:
\[
\text{Total earnings from mowing} = 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x
\]

According to the problem, Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[
54x + \text{Earnings from lemonade} = 80
\]

Let \( L \) be the earnings from lemonade sales. Thus, we have:
\[
54x + L = 80
\]

Now, we need to find \( x \). Since \( L \) must be non-negative, we need \( 54x \) to be less than or equal to 80:
\[
54x \leq 80
\]
\[
x \leq \frac{80}{54} \approx 1.48
\]

Since \( x \) must be a whole number, the maximum value for \( x \) is 1. Let's check \( x = 1 \):
\[
54(1) = 54
\]
Then,
\[
L = 80 - 54 = 26

- Earnings from Alba: \( 6 \times 5 \times 1 = 30 \)

Total earnings from mowing:

1. **Distance rowed by Dijana**: 50 miles
2. **Distance rowed by Anis**: Anis rowed \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more miles than Dijana. 

To find out how many miles Anis rowed, we calculate \( \frac{1}{5} \) of Dijana's distance:

1. **Total cups of tea**: Lana has 27 cups of tea in total.

2. **Cups of cinnamon tea**: She brews a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea.

3. **Remaining cups for chamomile and mint tea**: 
   \[
   \text{Remaining cups} = \text{Total cups} - \text{Cups of cinnamon tea} = 27 - 15 = 12 \text{ cups}
   \]

4. **Dividing the remaining cups into rows**: Lana divides these 12 cups into 3 rows. Since she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, we can denote the number of cups of chamomile tea in each row as \( x \) and the number of cups of mint tea in each row as \( x \) as well.

5. **Total cups in each row**: Since there are 3 rows, the total number of cups of chamomile and mint tea combined is:
   \[
   3 \times (x + x) = 3 \times 2x = 6x
   \]
   We know that this total must equal the remaining cups:
   \[
   6x = 12
   \]

6. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   \[
   x = \frac{12}{6} = 2
   \]

Thus, each row has 2 cups of chamomile tea and 2 cups of mint tea.

7. **Finding the number of cups of mint tea in each row**: Since \( x = 2 \) represents the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we conclude that:

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + A + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   A = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's ages:
   \[
   P = A + J
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( P \) into the first equation.

Substituting \( A \) from equation 2 into equation 3:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now, substitute \( P \) and \( A \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100

From the problem, we know the following relationships:

1. \( A = 2 \) (Jason carried 2 balls)
2. \( J = 2A \) (Jordan carried twice as many as Jason)
3. \( A = 2B \) (Jason carried twice as many as Jeffrey)

Now, we can substitute the known values into these equations:

1. The total number of Pokemon caught by all three is:
   \[
   A + S + D = 339
   \]

2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan:
   \[
   A = S + 5
   \]

3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times what Adelwolfe has caught:
   \[
   S = 4D - 13
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( S \) into the first equation.

Substituting \( A \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[
(S + 5) + S + D = 339
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2S + D + 5 = 339
\]
Subtracting 5 from both sides gives:
\[
2S + D = 334
\]

Now, we can substitute \( S \) from the third equation into this equation:
\[
2(4D - 13) + D = 334
\]
Expanding this gives:
\[
8D - 26 + D = 334
\]
Combining like terms results in:
\[
9D - 26 = 334
\]
Adding 26 to both sides gives:
\[
9D = 360
\]
Dividing by 9 gives:
\[
D = 40
\]

Now that we have \( D \), we can find \( S \):
\[
S = 4D - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
\]

Finally, we can find \( A \):
\[
A = S + 5 = 147 + 5 = 152

To verify, we check the total:
\[
A + S + D = 152 + 147 + 40 = 339

1. **First Segment (South)**:
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 10 hours = 300 miles

2. **Second Segment (North)**:
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 miles/hour × 2 hours = 36 miles

3. **Third Segment (South)**:
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 22 miles/hour × 5 hours = 110 miles

Now, we will calculate the net distance traveled south:

- Total distance traveled south = Distance from the first segment + Distance from the third segment
  - Total distance south = 300 miles + 110 miles = 410 miles

- Total distance traveled north = Distance from the second segment
  - Total distance north = 36 miles

When Emil turns 24, he will be \( 24 - 19 = 5 \) years older. Therefore, in 5 years, Emil's age will be:

\[
E + 5 = 24
\]

Let \( D \) be the current age of Emil's dad, and \( B \) be the current age of Emil's brother.

According to the problem, when Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad and twice as old as his brother. This gives us the following equations:

1. Emil's age when he turns 24 is half of his dad's age at that time:
   \[
   24 = \frac{D + 5}{2}

2. Emil's age when he turns 24 is twice his brother's age at that time:

Now, we can solve these equations step by step.

### Solving for Dad's Age
From the first equation:
\[
24 = \frac{D + 5}{2}
\]
Multiplying both sides by 2:
\[
48 = D + 5
\]
Subtracting 5 from both sides:
\[
D = 48 - 5 = 43

### Solving for Brother's Age
From the second equation:
\[

1. **Initial Cooling on Low**:
   - The air conditioner cools at a rate of 2 degrees per hour on low.
   - It runs on low for 3 hours:
     \[
     \text{Cooling on low} = 2 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 6 \, \text{degrees}

2. **Cooling on High**:
   - The air conditioner cools at a rate of 3 degrees per hour on high.
   - It runs on high for 4 hours:
     \[
     \text{Cooling on high} = 3 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 12 \, \text{degrees}
     \]

3. **Total Cooling**:
   - Adding the cooling from both phases:
     \[
     \text{Total cooling} = 6 \, \text{degrees} + 12 \, \text{degrees} = 18 \, \text{degrees}
     \]

4. **Warming Up After AC is Turned Off**:
   - The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour when the air conditioner is off.
   - The air conditioner is turned off for 2 hours:
     \[
     \text{Warming up} = 2 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{degrees}

- Let \( x \) be the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time.
- Let \( y \) be the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet for the first time, which is given as 30 years.

Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, we can determine the timeline of events based on this information.

1. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
2. The next time the comet appears, Bill's dad will be \( 30 + 75 = 105 \) years old.
3. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw it the first time. Since Bill's dad was 30 years old when he first saw the comet, three times that age is \( 3 \times 30 = 90 \).

Now, we need to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the second time. 

Since Bill's dad will be 105 years old when the comet appears again, we can set up the equation:

\[
x + 75 = 90
\]

This equation states that Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time (which is \( x + 75 \)) equals 90.

- Alessandro's age = \( B = 4 \) years
- Helene's age = \( C \)
- Wilfred's age = \( D \)

According to the problem, the total age of the children is 20 years:

\[
A + B + C + D = 20

Substituting the known ages of Akbar and Alessandro:

\[
3 + 4 + C + D = 20
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
C + D = 20 - 7 = 13

gsm8k,gsm8k-1012,TrustRoute-NoCostAware,1,"To find the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park, we can work backwards from the final charge remaining.

1. **Final Charge**: The power bank has 28% remaining after the entire charging process.

2. **Charging Process**:
   - For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its total capacity each hour.
   - For the next 3 hours, it loses 7% of its total capacity each hour.

3. **Calculating Charge After 5 Hours**:
   - In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses:
     \[
     5 \text{ hours} \times 9\% = 45\%
     \]
   - Therefore, the charge remaining after 5 hours is:
     \[
     \text{Charge after 5 hours} = \text{Initial Charge} - 45\%
     \]

4. **Calculating Charge After 3 More Hours**:
   - In the next 3 hours, the power bank loses:
     \[
     3 \text{ hours} \times 7\% = 21\%
     \]
   - Therefore, the charge remaining after these 3 hours is:
     \[
     \text{Charge after 8 hours} = \text{Charge after 5 hours} - 21\%
     \]

5. **Setting Up the Equation**:
   - We know that after 8 hours, the remaining charge is 28%. Thus, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \text{Charge after 8 hours} = \text{Initial Charge} - 45\% - 21\%
     \]
     \[
     28\% = \text{Initial Charge} - 66\%

6. **Solving for Initial Charge**:
   - Rearranging the equation gives:
     \[
     \text{Initial Charge} = 28\% + 66\%

     \[
     \text{Initial Charge} = 94\%

Where:
- \( P \) is the future price,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price,
- \( r \) is the rate of increase (as a decimal),
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:

The price of each small stuffed animal is given as $4. Therefore, the price of each large stuffed animal, being three times that of a small one, is:

\[

1. **Substitute Teacher**: There is a 50% chance that there will be a substitute teacher. If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.

   - Probability of having a substitute teacher = 50% (or 0.5)
   - Probability of not having a substitute teacher = 50% (or 0.5)

2. **Normal Teacher**: If the normal teacher is present (50% chance), there are two scenarios:
   - **Extension for Everyone**: There is a 40% chance that the teacher will give an extension to the whole class.
   - **No Extension for Everyone**: If there is no extension, there is a 20% chance that Marcus can convince the teacher to give him a personal extension.

Now, let's calculate the probabilities step by step:

- **Probability of having to turn in homework with the normal teacher**:
  - Probability of no extension for the whole class = 60% (or 0.6)
  - Probability of Marcus convincing the teacher for a personal extension = 20% (or 0.2)

  Therefore, the probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework when the normal teacher is present is:
  
  \[

Now, we can express the total amount taken by all three people:

\[
x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920
\]

Now, let's simplify this equation step by step:

1. Combine the terms:
   \[
   x + x + 80 + 2(x + 80) = 1920
   \]
   \[
   x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920
   \]
   \[

2. Subtract 240 from both sides:

- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.

The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is given as 19. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Now, let's simplify this equation step by step:

1. Combine the terms on the left side:
   \[
   x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
   \]

2. To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 2:
   \[
   2(2x + 4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2 \cdot 19
   \]
   This results in:
   \[
   4x + 8 + x = 38
   \]

3. Combine like terms:
   \[
   5x + 8 = 38
   \]

4. Subtract 8 from both sides:
   \[
   5x = 30
   \]

5. Divide by 5:

Now that we have \( x \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in each set:
- Second set: \( x = 6 \)
- First set: \( x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \)
- Third set: \( \frac{x}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \)

The total time for both parts of the meal is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[

1. **Cost of the cast**: $200

2. **Cost of the doctor's visit**:
   - The doctor charges $300 per hour.
   - Since the visit lasts for 30 minutes, we convert this to hours: 30 minutes = 0.5 hours.
   - Cost for the visit = $300/hour * 0.5 hours = $150

3. **Cost of painkillers**:
   - The cost per pill is $4.

The total amount of fence they have is 100 feet, which gives us the equation:

\[
S + H = 100

We know that Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We also know that she spends 40 minutes walking on the beach.

First, we can convert the time spent on the beach into hours:

\[
\text{Time on beach} = 40 \text{ minutes} = \frac{40}{60} \text{ hours} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ hours}
\]

Next, we can use the formula for distance, which is:

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]

For the beach, we have:

\[
2 \text{ miles} = v \times \frac{2}{3} \text{ hours}
\]

From this equation, we can solve for \( v \):

\[
v = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{\frac{2}{3} \text{ hours}} = 2 \times \frac{3}{2} = 3 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Now that we have Grandma's speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk:

\[
\text{Speed on sidewalk} = 2v = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes for her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk. Using the formula for time:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

For the sidewalk:

\[
\text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{6 \text{ miles per hour}} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ hours}
\]

Now we convert this time into minutes:

\[
\text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 10 \text{ minutes}
\]

Finally, we can find the total time for the entire 3-mile walk by adding the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time on beach} + \text{Time on sidewalk} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}

2. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey:

gsm8k,gsm8k-1168,TrustRoute-NoCostAware,1,"Let's denote the lengths of the ropes as follows:

- Let \( r \) be the length of the red rope.
- Let \( b \) be the length of the blue rope.
- Let \( y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope:
   \[
   r = 4b
   \]

2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope:
   \[
   b = y - 7
   \]

3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters:
   \[
   r + b + y = 37
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( r \) and \( b \) into the combined length equation.

Substituting \( r = 4b \) into the combined length equation:
\[
4b + b + y = 37
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
5b + y = 37
\]

Next, we can substitute \( b = y - 7 \) into this equation:
\[
5(y - 7) + y = 37
\]
Expanding this gives:
\[
5y - 35 + y = 37
\]
Combining like terms results in:
\[
6y - 35 = 37
\]
Adding 35 to both sides:
\[
6y = 72
\]
Dividing by 6:
\[
y = 12
\]

Now that we have the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
\[
b = y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5
\]

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope:
\[
r = 4b = 4 \times 5 = 20
\]

Thus, the length of the red rope is:

1. **Initial amount of chalk**: 5 inches

2. **Chalk used on Monday**: 
   - The teacher used 45% of the chalk.
   - Amount used = 45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

3. **Chalk remaining after Monday**:
   - Remaining chalk = Initial chalk - Chalk used
   - Remaining chalk = 5 inches - 2.25 inches = 2.75 inches

4. **Chalk recycling threshold**: The teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches.

5. **Daily usage after Monday**: The teacher plans to use 20% of the chalk each day.
   - Daily usage = 20% of remaining chalk = 0.20 * 2.75 inches = 0.55 inches

6. **Determine how many days until recycling**:
   - The teacher can use the chalk until it is less than 2 inches.
   - Starting from 2.75 inches, we need to find out how many days it takes to reach below 2 inches.

   We can calculate the number of days \( n \) it takes to go from 2.75 inches to below 2 inches using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Remaining chalk after } n \text{ days} = 2.75 - n \times 0.55
   \]
   We want this to be less than 2 inches:
   \[
   2.75 - n \times 0.55 < 2
   \]
   Simplifying this inequality:
   \[
   2.75 - 2 < n \times 0.55
   \]
   \[
   0.75 < n \times 0.55
   \]
   \[
   n > \frac{0.75}{0.55} \approx 1.36

Since \( n \) must be a whole number (as he can't use chalk for a fraction of a day), we round up to the next whole number:

2. **Cleaning his room**: 
   - Earnings for cleaning his room = $1.50
   - Total earnings from cleaning his room = $1.50 (he did it once)

3. **Taking the trash to the curb**:

1. **First 30 seconds**: 
   - Number of pops = 20

2. **Next 30 seconds**: 
   - Number of pops = 3 times the first amount = \(3 \times 20 = 60\)

3. **Next 30 seconds**: 
   - Popping rate increases to four times the initial rate (20 pops).
   - Number of pops = \(4 \times 20 = 80\)

4. **Final 30 seconds**: 
   - Popping slows down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds (80 pops).
   - Number of pops = \( \frac{80}{2} = 40\)

Now, let's sum up the total number of pops during the cooking process:

\[
\text{Total pops during cooking} = 20 + 60 + 80 + 40

- Test tubes gathered: \( T \)
- Beakers gathered: \( B \)
- Petri dishes gathered: \( P \)

From the problem, we know the following:

1. Dr. Grumpus requested:
   - 16 test tubes
   - 7 beakers
   - 14 Petri dishes

2. Igor gathered:
   - Half the number of test tubes requested: \( T = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \)
   - Two more than the number of Petri dishes requested: \( P = 14 + 2 = 16 \)
   - The correct number of beakers: \( B = 7 \)

However, Igor lost some beakers on the way to the lab bench. Let's denote the number of beakers Igor lost as \( L \). Therefore, the number of beakers on the lab bench is \( B - L \).

Now, we can set up the equation for the total number of items on the lab bench:

\[
T + (B - L) + P = 29
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
8 + (7 - L) + 16 = 29
\]

Now, simplify the equation:

\[
8 + 7 - L + 16 = 29
\]
\[

1. **Understanding Speeds**:
   - Let \( v \) be Vanessa's speed in miles per minute.
   - Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Aaron's speed is \( 2v \).

2. **Distance Run**:
   - We know that Vanessa ran 4 miles.
   - We need to find out how far Aaron ran. Since Vanessa can run twice as far as Aaron, if we let \( d \) be the distance Aaron ran, then:
     \[
     4 = 2d \implies d = 2 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Time Taken by Aaron**:
   - We know Aaron completed his part of the race (2 miles) in 16 minutes.
   - Using the formula for time, \( \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \), we can find Aaron's speed:
     \[
     \text{Time} = 16 \text{ minutes} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{2v} \implies 16 = \frac{2}{2v} \implies 16 = \frac{1}{v} \implies v = \frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute}

gsm8k,gsm8k-1317,TrustRoute-NoCostAware,1,"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let:
- \( c \) = number of chickens
- \( w \) = number of cows

We have two pieces of information:

1. The total number of animals is 20:
   \[
   c + w = 20
   \]

2. The total number of legs is 70. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs:
   \[
   2c + 4w = 70
   \]

Now we can solve these equations step by step.

From the first equation, we can express \( w \) in terms of \( c \):
\[
w = 20 - c
\]

Now, we can substitute this expression for \( w \) into the second equation:
\[
2c + 4(20 - c) = 70
\]

Expanding this gives:
\[
2c + 80 - 4c = 70
\]

Combining like terms:
\[
-2c + 80 = 70
\]

Subtracting 80 from both sides:
\[
-2c = 70 - 80
\]
\[
-2c = -10
\]

Dividing both sides by -2:
\[
c = 5
\]

Now that we have the number of chickens, we can find the number of cows using the first equation:
\[
w = 20 - c = 20 - 5 = 15
\]

- **5 chickens**
