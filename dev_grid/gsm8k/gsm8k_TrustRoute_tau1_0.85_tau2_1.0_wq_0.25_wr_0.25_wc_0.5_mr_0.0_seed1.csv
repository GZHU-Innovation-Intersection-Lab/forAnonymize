gsm8k,gsm8k-12,TrustRoute,1,"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on his lemon tree, we need to calculate when his total profits exceed his total costs. Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the costs and revenues
- **Initial cost**: $90 (one-time cost to plant the tree).
- **Annual revenue**: The tree produces 7 lemons per year, and each lemon sells for $1.50.  
  So, annual revenue = 7 lemons × $1.50/ lemon = $10.50.
- **Annual cost**: $3 per year for watering and feeding.
- **Net profit per year**: Annual revenue minus annual cost = $10.50 - $3 = $7.50.

This means that after the initial investment, Carlos makes a net profit of $7.50 each year.

### Step 2: Calculate the cumulative profit
After \(n\) years, the total costs and revenues are:
- Total costs = Initial cost + Annual costs for \(n\) years = $90 + (3 × n)$.
- Total revenue = Annual revenue for \(n\) years = $10.50 × n$.
- Cumulative profit = Total revenue - Total costs = ($10.50 × n) - ($90 + 3 × n) = $7.50n - $90$.

We want to find when the cumulative profit becomes positive, i.e., when:
\[
7.50n - 90 > 0
\]
\[
7.50n > 90
\]
\[
n > \frac{90}{7.50}
\]
\[
n > 12
\]

Since \(n\) must be a whole number (you can't have a fraction of a year), we need to check the values around 12.

### Step 3: Verify with specific years
- After 12 years:  
  Cumulative profit = $7.50 × 12 - $90 = $90 - $90 = $0.  
  (This is break-even; he hasn't started earning money yet.)
- After 13 years:  
  Cumulative profit = $7.50 × 13 - $90 = $97.50 - $90 = $7.50.  
  (This is positive, so he starts earning money.)

### Conclusion
It will take **13 years** for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, as that's when his cumulative profit becomes positive for the first time.",0.0073973500000000005,26.383166313171387,0,0,cand-grok-3-mini,stage2_confidence,

### Step 1: Understand the problem
- Kyle bought the book for $19.50 after a 25% discount.
- This means he paid 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

### Step 2: Set up the equation
- Let the original price be \( P \).
- 75% of \( P \) equals $19.50.
- In mathematical terms: \( 0.75 \times P = 19.50 \).

### Step 3: Solve for \( P \)
- Divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
  \[
  P = \frac{19.50}{0.75}

- Performing the division: \( 19.50 \div 0.75 = 26 \).

### Step 4: Verify the solution
- If the original price is $26, a 25% discount would be \( 0.25 \times 26 = 6.50 \).
- Subtract the discount from the original price: \( 26 - 6.50 = 19.50 \).
- This matches the price Kyle paid, so our calculation is correct.

Marie paid a total of $50, so the amount spent on pizzas is:
$50 - $33 = $17

### Step 3: Calculate the number of pizza boxes
Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find the number of boxes (let's call it x):
x = Total cost of pizzas ÷ Cost per pizza  
x = $17 ÷ $8.50  
x = 2

### Step 4: Verify the calculation
If Marie bought 2 boxes: 2 × $8.50 = $17  
Adding this to the other costs: $33 + $17 = $50, which matches the total paid.

Therefore, Marie ordered **2 boxes of pizza**.",0.0071630999999999995,12.450208902359009,0,0,cand-grok-3-mini,stage2_vote,

### Step 1: Identify the costs of the high heels
- One pair of high heels costs $33.
- The other pair costs twice as much as the first pair.
  - So, the cost of the second pair is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the two pairs of high heels

### Step 1: Identify the guesses
- The first friend guesses: 80 jelly beans.
- The second friend guesses: 20 more than half of the first friend's guess.
  - Half of 80 is \( 80 \div 2 = 40 \).
  - Adding 20 gives: \( 40 + 20 = 60 \).
  - So, the second guess is 60.
- The third friend guesses: 25% more than the first friend's guess.
  - 25% of 80 is \( 0.25 \times 80 = 20 \).
  - Adding that to the original guess gives: \( 80 + 20 = 100 \).
  - So, the third guess is 100.

The three guesses are: 80, 60, and 100.

### Step 2: Calculate the average

### Step 1: Understand the speeds
- Dana skips at 3 miles per hour.
- Her running speed is four times her walking speed.
- Her skipping speed is half her running speed.

Let’s denote her walking speed as \( W \) miles per hour.

- Running speed = \( 4W \).
- Skipping speed = half of running speed = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 4W = 2W \).

We know her skipping speed is 3 mph, so:
\[
2W = 3
\]
\[
W = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ mph (walking speed)}.
\]

- Running speed = \( 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \) mph.

### Step 2: Calculate the time spent on each activity
- Total time = 6 hours.
- Time running = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
- Time walking = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

### Step 3: Calculate the distance traveled
- Distance running = Running speed × Time running = \( 6 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 12 \, \text{miles} \).
- Distance walking = Walking speed × Time walking = \( 1.5 \, \text{mph} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 6 \, \text{miles} \).

- Total distance = Distance running + Distance walking = \( 12 + 6 = 18 \, \text{miles} \).

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of games played was 22:

2. They won 8 more games than they lost:
   W = L + 8

Now we can use substitution. Substitute the second equation into the first one:

1. **Calculate Julia's rowing speed**:
   - Julia rows 20 feet in 16 seconds.
   - Her speed is:
     \[
     \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second}
     \]

2. **Determine the total time to reach shore**:
   - It is given that the shore is 64 seconds away.

3. **Calculate the total distance to shore**:
   - Using her speed, we can find the distance she will cover in 64 seconds:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 80 \text{ feet}
     \]

4. **Calculate the amount of water taken on**:
   - The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed.
   - First, we find out how many 10-foot segments are in 80 feet:
     \[
     \text{Segments} = \frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/segment}} = 8 \text{ segments}
     \]
   - Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water per segment, the total amount of water taken on is:
     \[
     \text{Total water} = 8 \text{ segments} \times 2 \text{ liters/segment} = 16 \text{ liters}

- Let \( J \) be the maximum number of photographs Jamal's phone can hold.
- Let \( B \) be the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold.
- Let \( D \) be the number of ducks (or birds) in Jamal's photograph.

From the problem, we know:

1. \( J = 1800 \) (the maximum number of photographs Jamal's phone can hold).
2. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, which gives us the equation:
   \[
   J = 6B
   \]
3. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph:
   \[
   B = 50D
   \]

Now, we can substitute the value of \( J \) into the first equation to find \( B \):
\[
1800 = 6B
\]
To solve for \( B \), divide both sides by 6:
\[
B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300
\]

Now that we have \( B \), we can use the second equation to find \( D \):
\[
B = 50D
\]
Substituting \( B = 300 \) into this equation gives:
\[
300 = 50D
\]
To solve for \( D \), divide both sides by 50:
\[
D = \frac{300}{50} = 6
\]

Thus, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is \( \boxed{6} \).",0.00655475,14.091268539428711,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,

First, we can determine the total number of parts in the ratio:

\[
7 \text{ (sugar)} + 13 \text{ (water)} = 20 \text{ parts}
\]

Next, we know that the total amount of sugar and water combined is 120 teaspoons. We can set up the equation to find the value of one part:

- Adrien's salary 4 years ago: $40,000
- Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's (4 years ago)
- Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%
- Both salaries increased simultaneously (by the same percentage)

**Step 1: Find Lylah's salary 4 years ago**

If Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's:
- Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary × 1.30
- $40,000 = Lylah's salary × 1.30
- Lylah's salary = $40,000 ÷ 1.30
- Lylah's salary = $30,769.23 (approximately)

**Step 2: Find Adrien's salary four years later**

Adrien's new salary = $40,000 × 1.40 = $56,000

**Step 3: Find the percentage increase**

Since both salaries increased simultaneously (by the same percentage):
- Percentage increase = 40%

**Step 4: Find Lylah's salary four years later**

Lylah's new salary = $30,769.23 × 1.40 = $43,076.92 (approximately)

**Step 5: Calculate total salary four years later**

Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
Total salary = $56,000 + $43,076.92
Total salary = $99,076.92

**Answer: $99,076.92** (or approximately $99,077)

If we want an exact answer using fractions:

### Step 1: Understand the sleep pattern
- **Monday:** Sadie slept 8 hours.
- **Tuesday and Wednesday:** She slept 2 hours less than Monday each day.
  - So, Tuesday: 8 - 2 = 6 hours
  - Wednesday: 8 - 2 = 6 hours
- **The rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday):** She slept 1 hour more than the amount she slept on Tuesday and Wednesday.
  - Tuesday and Wednesday were both 6 hours, so 1 hour more than that is 6 + 1 = 7 hours per day.
  - There are 4 days in the rest of the week, so she slept 7 hours each on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.

### Step 2: Calculate the total hours
- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours
- Wednesday: 6 hours
- Thursday: 7 hours
- Friday: 7 hours
- Saturday: 7 hours
- Sunday: 7 hours

gsm8k,gsm8k-137,TrustRoute,1,"Sure, I'll help you calculate the total cost of Rory's delivery order. Let's break it down step by step for clarity:

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the items
- **Subs:** 2 subs at $7.50 each = 2 × $7.50 = $15.00
- **Bags of chips:** 2 bags at $1.50 each = 2 × $1.50 = $3.00
- **Cookies:** 2 cookies at $1.00 each = 2 × $1.00 = $2.00

**Subtotal (cost of items only):** $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

### Step 2: Add the delivery fee
- The delivery fee is 20% of the subtotal.
- 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 × $20.00 = $4.00

**Total after delivery fee:** $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

### Step 3: Add the tip
- Rory wants to add a $5.00 tip.
- Total cost including tip: $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

- Distances are given in miles, but speeds are in feet per minute, so we'll convert miles to feet.
- 1 mile = 5280 feet.

- Steve's distance: 3 miles = 3 × 5280 = 15,840 feet.
- Tim's distance: 2 miles = 2 × 5280 = 10,560 feet.

**Blake's Distance:**
Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard football field. Each back-and-forth trip consists of running 100 yards to one end and then 100 yards back, which totals 200 yards per trip.

So, for 15 trips:
\[
\text{Distance Blake runs} = 15 \times 200 \text{ yards} = 3000 \text{ yards}
\]

**Kelly's Distance:**
Kelly runs back and forth once on the 100-yard field, which is:
\[
\text{Distance for 1 trip} = 100 \text{ yards} \text{ (to one end)} + 100 \text{ yards} \text{ (back)} = 200 \text{ yards}
\]

After that, she runs to the 40-yard line and back. The distance to the 40-yard line is 40 yards, and the return trip is also 40 yards, totaling:
\[
\text{Distance for one trip to 40-yard line and back} = 40 \text{ yards} + 40 \text{ yards} = 80 \text{ yards}
\]

She does this 34 times:
\[
\text{Distance Kelly runs for 34 trips} = 34 \times 80 \text{ yards} = 2720 \text{ yards}

To find out how much farther the winner (Blake) runs than the loser (Kelly):

3. **Cost of the Scanner**: €157
4. **Cost of the CD Burner**: €74

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the computer and accessories:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost of Computer} + \text{Cost of Scanner} + \text{Cost of CD Burner} + \text{Cost of Printer}

1. **Determine the payment from Publisher A:**
   - Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of sentences Mark edits for Publisher A.
   - Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, he also edits \( x \) sentences for Publisher B.
   - The total number of sentences edited is 1000, so:
     \[
     x + x = 1000 \implies 2x = 1000 \implies x = 500
     \]
   - Therefore, Mark edits 500 sentences for Publisher A.

2. **Calculate the earnings from Publisher A:**
   - The earnings from Publisher A can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Earnings from A} = 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents}

3. **Determine the payment from Publisher B:**
   - Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, which is:
     \[
     2 \times 5 \text{ cents} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence}
     \]
   - Mark also edits 500 sentences for Publisher B.

4. **Calculate the earnings from Publisher B:**
   - The earnings from Publisher B can be calculated as:
