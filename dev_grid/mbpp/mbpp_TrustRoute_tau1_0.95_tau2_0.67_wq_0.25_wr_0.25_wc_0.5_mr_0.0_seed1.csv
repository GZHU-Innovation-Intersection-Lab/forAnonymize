Here's the logic:
1.  **Handle `n=0`**: If `n` is `0`, the ""left-most unset bit"" is at position `0`. Setting it results in `1`.
2.  **Find MSB position**: Determine `k`, the position of the most significant set bit of `n`. This is `n.bit_length() - 1`.
3.  **Search for unset bit**: Iterate `p` from `k` down to `0`. If the `p`-th bit of `n` is `0`, set that bit (`n | (1 << p)`) and return the result.
4.  **All bits set**: If the loop completes, it means all bits from `0` to `k` are already `1` (e.g., `n=7` which is `0111` in 3 bits). In this case, the left-most unset bit is at position `k+1`. Set this bit and return (`n | (1 << (k + 1))`).

```python
def set_left_most_unset_bit(n: int) -> int:
    if n == 0:
