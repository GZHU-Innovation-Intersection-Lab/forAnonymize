gsm8k,gsm8k-12,TrustRoute,1,"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate when his total profit becomes positive. Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the costs and revenues
- **Initial cost**: $90 (one-time cost to plant the tree).
- **Annual revenue**: The tree produces 7 lemons per year, and each lemon sells for $1.50.  
  So, annual revenue = 7 lemons × $1.50/lemmon = $10.50.
- **Annual cost**: $3 for watering and feeding.
- **Annual net profit**: Annual revenue minus annual cost = $10.50 - $3 = $7.50.

This means that after the initial investment, Carlos makes a net profit of $7.50 each year.

### Step 2: Calculate the cumulative profit
- After year 0 (initial planting), the total cash flow is -$90.
- After n years, the cumulative profit is:  
  Cumulative profit = -Initial cost + (Annual net profit × n)  
  Cumulative profit = -$90 + ($7.50 × n)

We need to find the smallest n (number of years) where the cumulative profit is greater than 0 (i.e., he starts earning money).  
So, we solve:  
-$90 + ($7.50 × n) > 0  
$7.50 × n > $90  
n > $90 / $7.50  
n > 12

Since n must be a whole number (you can't have a fraction of a year in this context), we round up to the next whole number: n = 13.

### Step 3: Verify the result
- After 12 years: Cumulative profit = -$90 + (12 × $7.50) = -$90 + $90 = $0  
  (He breaks even, but hasn't started earning money yet.)
- After 13 years: Cumulative profit = -$90 + (13 × $7.50) = -$90 + $97.50 = +$7.50  
  (Now, he has a positive profit.)

### Conclusion
It will take **13 years** for Carlos to start earning money from the lemon tree, as that's when his cumulative profit becomes positive.",0.0082466,27.231106996536255,0,0,cand-grok-3-mini,stage2_confidence,
gsm8k,gsm8k-13,TrustRoute,1,"Let's denote the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. At the green house, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners:
   \[
   \text{Sold at green house} = \frac{x}{3}
   \]
   After this sale, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

2. Next, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house:
   \[
   \text{Sold at red house} = 2
   \]
   After this sale, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

3. Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. The amount left before this sale is \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \), so she sold:
   \[
   \text{Sold at orange house} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]

   To simplify this, we can factor out \( \frac{1}{2} \):
   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)

   So the number of vacuum cleaners left after the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)

4. We know that after all these sales, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

5. Now, we can solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10 \quad (\text{Multiplying both sides by 2})
   \]
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]
   \[
   2x = 36 \quad (\text{Multiplying both sides by 3})

   x = 18 \quad (\text{Dividing both sides by 2})

1. **Calculate the amount of water in the orange drink:**
   - The orange drink is 10 liters and is two-thirds water.
   - Amount of water in the orange drink = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 \) liters = \( \frac{20}{3} \) liters ≈ 6.67 liters.

2. **Calculate the amount of water in the pineapple drink:**
   - The pineapple drink is 15 liters and is three-fifths water.
   - Amount of water in the pineapple drink = \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 \) liters = 9 liters.

3. **Calculate the total amount of water before the spill:**
   - Total water = Water in orange drink + Water in pineapple drink
   - Total water = \( \frac{20}{3} + 9 \) liters.
   - Convert 9 liters to a fraction with a denominator of 3: \( 9 = \frac{27}{3} \).
   - Total water = \( \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \) liters ≈ 15.67 liters.

4. **Account for the spill:**
   - When 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, we need to determine how much water was in that spilled liter.
   - Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water in the spilled liter = \( \frac{2}{3} \) liters.

If their ages are in the ratio 7:11, I can express their ages as:
- Darrell's age = 7x
- Allen's age = 11x

where x is a common multiplier.

**Step 2: Use the total age to find x**

Their total age is 162, so:

1.  Gretchen has a total of 110 coins:
    G + S = 110

2.  There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins:
    G = S + 30

Now we can use substitution to solve for G.
Substitute the second equation into the first equation:
(S + 30) + S = 110
2S + 30 = 110
2S = 110 - 30
2S = 80
S = 80 / 2
S = 40

Now that we know Gretchen has 40 silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
G = S + 30
G = 40 + 30
G = 70

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

To verify:
Gold coins (G) = 70
Silver coins (S) = 40
Total coins = 70 + 40 = 110 (Matches the given total)

Let \(x\) be the number of boxes. The total weight is given by:

Subtract 3755 from both sides:

Let me track his TV watching for each day:

**Monday:** 1-hour episode = 1 hour

**Tuesday:** 1-hour episode = 1 hour

**Wednesday:** Some number of 30-minute episodes = ? (this is what I need to find)

**Thursday:** 1-hour episode + 1 thirty-minute show = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 hours

gsm8k,gsm8k-108,TrustRoute,1,"Let me reason through this step by step to determine how many cookies Henry baked last year.

Let \( x \) represent the number of cookies Henry baked last year.

- Henry intended to bake twice as many as last year, so he planned to bake \( 2x \) cookies.
- However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he intended, so he baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.
- After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, leaving him with \( (2x + 15) - 5 \) cookies.
- We know he ended up with 110 cookies, so we can set up the equation:
  \[
  (2x + 15) - 5 = 110
  \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

- Simplify the equation:
  \[
  2x + 15 - 5 = 110
  \]
  \[
  2x + 10 = 110
  \]
- Subtract 10 from both sides:
  \[
  2x = 100
  \]
- Divide both sides by 2:
  \[
  x = 50
  \]

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

To verify:
- He intended to bake \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) cookies.
- He actually baked \( 100 + 15 = 115 \) cookies.
- After dropping 5, he had \( 115 - 5 = 110 \) cookies, which matches the problem.",0.00242187,12.985798120498657,0,0,cand-grok-3-mini,stage2_confidence,

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the gas before cashback
- Price per gallon: $3.00
- Gallons purchased: 10
- Total cost = $3.00 × 10 = $30.00

### Step 2: Calculate the total cashback rewards
- Cashback per gallon: $0.20
- Gallons purchased: 10
- Total cashback = $0.20 × 10 = $2.00

### Step 3: Subtract the cashback from the total cost
- Net cost after cashback = Total cost - Total cashback
- Net cost = $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

So, after applying the cashback rewards, the effective cost for 10 gallons of gas will be **$28.00**. This means the person pays $30.00 upfront and gets $2.00 back as cashback.",0.00481608,12.870542526245117,0,0,cand-grok-3-mini,stage2_confidence,

1. **Calculate Julia's rowing speed**: 
   Julia rows 20 feet in 16 seconds. To find her speed in feet per second:
   \[
   \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total time to reach shore**:
   We know that the shore is 64 seconds away.

3. **Calculate the total distance to shore**:
   Using her speed, we can calculate the total distance she will row in 64 seconds:
   \[
   \text{Distance to shore} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 80 \text{ feet}

7 \text{ (sugar)} + 13 \text{ (water)} = 20 \text{ (total parts)}

Next, we know that the total amount of sugar and water combined is 120 teaspoons. We can set up the equation based on the ratio:

- The amount of sugar used is \( 7x \)
- The amount of water used is \( 13x \)

The total amount is given by:

   \[
   A = L + 0.3L = 1.3L
   \]

   Given that Adrien earned $40,000 four years ago:

   \[
   40000 = 1.3L

   Substituting Adrien's salary four years ago:

   \[
   A' = 1.4 \times 40000 = 56000

3. **Determine Lylah's salary four years later.**
   Since both Adrien's and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously, we need to find the percentage increase in Lylah's salary. We know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's four years ago, so we can assume Lylah's salary also increased by the same percentage (40%).

   Lylah's salary four years later (L') can be calculated as:

**Given relationships:**
1. Total bees: q + b + w = 700
2. Twice as many workers as babies: w = 2b
3. Twice as many babies as queens: b = 2q

gsm8k,gsm8k-157,TrustRoute,1,"To determine how much farther the winner runs than the loser, we need to calculate the distances each person runs.

**Blake's Distance:**
Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard football field. Each back-and-forth run covers a distance of:
- 100 yards (to one end) + 100 yards (back) = 200 yards for one complete back-and-forth.

Since he does this 15 times:
- Total distance Blake runs = 15 * 200 yards = 3000 yards.

**Kelly's Distance:**
Kelly runs back and forth once on the 100-yard field, which covers:
- 100 yards (to one end) + 100 yards (back) = 200 yards for her first complete back-and-forth.

After that, she runs to the 40-yard line and back. The distance to the 40-yard line is 40 yards, so the round trip is:
- 40 yards (to the 40-yard line) + 40 yards (back) = 80 yards for one complete trip to the 40-yard line.

She does this 34 times:
- Total distance Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back = 34 * 80 yards = 2720 yards.

Now, we can calculate the difference in distance between Blake and Kelly:
- Difference = Blake's distance - Kelly's distance = 3000 yards - 2720 yards = 280 yards.

Thus, the winner (Blake) runs **280 yards** farther than the loser (Kelly).",0.00455885,20.75369095802307,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_confidence,

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of computer} + \text{Cost of scanner} + \text{Cost of CD burner} + \text{Cost of printer}

**Team A (Well-rounded team):**
Each member runs their leg in 55 seconds. Since there are 4 members, the total time for Team A is:
\[
\text{Total time for Team A} = 4 \times 55 = 220 \text{ seconds}
\]

**Team B (Less well-rounded team):**
- The first runner runs their leg in 60 seconds.
- The second runner runs 3 seconds faster than the first, so:
  \[
  \text{Time for 2nd runner} = 60 - 3 = 57 \text{ seconds}
  \]
- The third runner runs 3 seconds faster than the second, so:
  \[
  \text{Time for 3rd runner} = 57 - 3 = 54 \text{ seconds}
  \]
- The fourth runner runs 3 seconds faster than the third, so:
  \[
  \text{Time for 4th runner} = 54 - 3 = 51 \text{ seconds}

Now, we can calculate the total time for Team B:
\[
\text{Total time for Team B} = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51

gsm8k,gsm8k-186,TrustRoute,1,"To find out how many rats are in each cage, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the total straw used for each type of rodent:**
   - Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage.
   - There are 3 cages of rats, so the total number of rats is \( 3r \).
   - Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, so the total straw used for rats is:
     \[
     \text{Straw for rats} = 3r \times 6 = 18r
     \]

2. **Calculate the straw used for hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
   - Let \( h \) be the number of hamsters in each cage.
   - The total number of hamsters is \( 10h \).
   - The total straw used for hamsters is:
     \[
     \text{Straw for hamsters} = 10h \times 5 = 50h
     \]

3. **Calculate the straw used for rabbits:**
   - The problem states that 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

4. **Set up the equation for total straw distributed:**
   - The total straw distributed among all rodents is given as 160 pieces. Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     18r + 50h + 20 = 160
     \]

5. **Simplify the equation:**
   - Subtract 20 from both sides:
     \[
     18r + 50h = 140
     \]

6. **Solve for \( r \) and \( h \):**
   - We can express \( h \) in terms of \( r \) or vice versa. Let's express \( h \):
     \[
     50h = 140 - 18r
     \]
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18r}{50}

7. **Find integer solutions:**
   - Since \( h \) must be a non-negative integer, \( 140 - 18r \) must be non-negative and divisible by 50.
   - Let's test integer values for \( r \):

   - For \( r = 0 \):
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18(0)}{50} = \frac{140}{50} = 2.8 \quad (\text{not an integer})

   - For \( r = 2 \):
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18(2)}{50} = \frac{104}{50} = 2.08 \quad (\text{not an integer})

   - For \( r = 4 \):
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18(4)}{50} = \frac{68}{50} = 1.36 \quad (\text{not an integer})
     \]

   - For \( r = 5 \):
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18(5)}{50} = \frac{50}{50} = 1 \quad (\text{integer})
     \]

   - For \( r = 6 \):
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18(6)}{50} = \frac{32}{50} = 0.64 \quad (\text{not an integer})

\[ A = P(1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n months, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (as a decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of months.

In this case:
- \( P = 100 \) (the amount owed)
- \( r = 0.02 \) (2% interest rate)
- \( n = 3 \) (the number of months)

Now, we can plug in the values:

   \text{Cards collected in the second month} = 60 - 20 = 40
   \]

4. **Total cards after two months**: We can now calculate the total number of cards after the first two months.
   \[
   \text{Total after two months} = 20 + 60 + 40 = 120
   \]

5. **Third month**: She collects twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months.
   \[
   \text{Total collected in the first and second months} = 60 + 40 = 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cards collected in the third month} = 2 \times 100 = 200
   \]

6. **Final total**: Now we add the cards collected in the third month to the total after two months.
   \[
   \text{Total cards now} = 120 + 200 = 320
   \]

Thus, Elaine has a total of **320 Pokémon cards** now.",0.00297985,14.136606454849243,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,
gsm8k,gsm8k-199,TrustRoute,1,"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the payment from Publisher A**:
   - Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers. Since he edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits \( \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \) sentences for each publisher.
   - Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, for the 500 sentences he edits for Publisher A, he earns:
     \[
     500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents}
     \]

2. **Determine the payment from Publisher B**:
   - Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays. Thus, Publisher B pays:
     \[
     2 \times 5 \text{ cents} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence}
     \]
   - For the 500 sentences he edits for Publisher B, he earns:
     \[
     500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total earnings for the week**:
   - Now, we add the earnings from both publishers:
     \[
     2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents}
     \]

Therefore, Mark makes a total of **7500 cents** in a week.",0.00234425,17.80525231361389,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,
