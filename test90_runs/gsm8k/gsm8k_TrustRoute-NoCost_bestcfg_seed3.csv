gsm8k,gsm8k-203,TrustRoute-NoCost,3,"To find out how many slices of cheese Carl used in total, we can break it down into three parts: the sandwiches, the omelets, and the macaroni and cheese.

1. **Sandwiches**: 
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch for 7 days.
   - Each sandwich used 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese for sandwiches = 7 days × 2 slices/day = 14 slices.

2. **Omelets**: 
   - Carl had omelets for breakfast for 3 days.
   - Each omelet used one more slice of cheese than the sandwiches. Since each sandwich uses 2 slices, each omelet uses 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

gsm8k,gsm8k-205,TrustRoute-NoCost,3,"To find out what score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after dropping the lowest score, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total score needed for an average of 93 after dropping the lowest score.**
   Since there are six tests and the lowest score will be dropped, we will be averaging the top five scores. To find the total score needed for an average of 93, we can use the formula:

   \[
   \text{Total needed for average} = \text{Average} \times \text{Number of tests considered}
   \]

   Here, the average is 93 and the number of tests considered is 5 (after dropping the lowest score):

   \[
   \text{Total needed} = 93 \times 5 = 465
   \]

2. **Calculate the sum of the first five test scores.**
   Brinley's scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. We will sum these scores:

   \[
   \text{Sum of scores} = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438
   \]

3. **Determine the score needed on the sixth test.**
   Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test. After dropping the lowest score, we need the sum of the highest five scores to equal 465. The lowest score among the first five is 71, so we can calculate:

   \[
   438 + x - 71 = 465
   \]

   Simplifying this gives:

   \[
   438 + x - 71 = 465
   \]
   \[
   367 + x = 465
   \]
   \[
   x = 465 - 367

1. **Cost of the jacket**: $30
2. **Cost of 2 pairs of shoes**: 2 pairs × $20/pair = $40

Now, we can find the total cost:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of jacket} + \text{Cost of shoes} = 30 + 40 = 70

Next, we calculate how much money Sara has after babysitting and how much more she needs to earn by mowing the lawn.

3. **Earnings from babysitting**: 
   - She babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time.
   - Total earnings from babysitting = 4 × $5 = $20

4. **Total money Sara has before mowing the lawn**:
   - She already has $10 saved.

Both pools leak at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. In 4 minutes, each pool will lose:

\[
\text{Water lost by each pool} = 4 \text{ gallons/minute} \times 4 \text{ minutes} = 16 \text{ gallons}

Now, let's calculate the current amount of water in each pool:

- The current amount of water in the small pool is:
\[
S - 16
\]

- The current amount of water in the big pool is:
\[
2S - 16
\]

According to the problem, now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
2S - 16 = 4(S - 16)
\]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:

1. Expand the right side:

   - Fire type: 30
   - Grass type: 20
   - Water type: 40

   Total initial cards = 30 (fire) + 20 (grass) + 40 (water) = 90 cards.

2. **Adjust for the changes:**
   - James loses 8 water type cards: 
     - New water type count = 40 - 8 = 32.
   - James buys 14 grass type cards: 
     - New grass type count = 20 + 14 = 34.

3. **Calculate the new total number of cards:**
   - Fire type: 30

3. **Extra cheese**: $1.00
4. **Avocado**: $1.00
5. **Sauces**: 2 sauces at $0.25 each = 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
6. **Meal upgrade**: $3.00

Now, let's add all these costs together:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Base burrito} + \text{Extra meat} + \text{Extra cheese} + \text{Avocado} + \text{Sauces} + \text{Meal upgrade}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost} = 6.50 + 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 + 3.00

   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms for one house is:
     \[
     3 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows}

gsm8k,gsm8k-314,TrustRoute-NoCost,3,"Let the number of players on the defense be \( d \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is \( 2d \) (twice as many as on the defense).
- The number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{d}{2} \) (half the number of players on the defense).

The total number of members in the team is given as 105. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
d + 2d + \frac{d}{2} = 105
\]

Now, let's simplify the left side of the equation:

\[
d + 2d = 3d
\]

So we can rewrite the equation as:

\[
3d + \frac{d}{2} = 105
\]

To combine the terms, we can express \( 3d \) in terms of a fraction with a common denominator:

\[
3d = \frac{6d}{2}
\]

Now, substituting this back into the equation gives:

\[
\frac{6d}{2} + \frac{d}{2} = 105
\]

Combining the fractions:

\[
\frac{6d + d}{2} = 105
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{7d}{2} = 105
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 2:

\[
7d = 210
\]

Now, divide both sides by 7:

\[
d = 30
\]

Thus, the number of players on the defense is \( \boxed{30} \). 

To verify:
- Offense: \( 2d = 2 \times 30 = 60 \)
- Special teams: \( \frac{d}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \)

Adding these together:

\[

    *   Initial total value = 8 shares * $8/share = $64

2.  **Calculate the value after the first year (50% increase):**
    *   The price increases by 50%, so the new price is 150% of the original price.
    *   Price after year 1 = $8 * (1 + 0.50) = $8 * 1.50 = $12 per share.

3.  **Calculate the value after the second year (25% decrease):**
    *   The price decreases by 25% from the *new* price ($12). So, the new price is 75% of $12.
    *   Price after year 2 = $12 * (1 - 0.25) = $12 * 0.75 = $9 per share.

4.  **Calculate the final total value of all shares:**

   - If Morgan invites \( n \) friends, the total number of people (including Morgan) is \( n + 1 \).
   - Therefore, the total cost for mini-golf is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of mini-golf} = 5 \times (n + 1)
     \]

2. **Cost of arcade tokens**: 
   - Each person gets $5 in arcade tokens.
   - The total cost for arcade tokens is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of arcade tokens} = 5 \times (n + 1)
     \]

3. **Cost of go-karts**: 
   - Each ride costs $10, and they want to ride twice.
   - The total cost for go-karts is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of go-karts} = 10 \times 2 \times (n + 1) = 20 \times (n + 1)
     \]

4. **Total cost**:
   - The total cost for mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-karts is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of mini-golf} + \text{Cost of arcade tokens} + \text{Cost of go-karts}
     \]
   - Substituting the costs we calculated:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 5(n + 1) + 5(n + 1) + 20(n + 1)
     \]
   - Simplifying this:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = (5 + 5 + 20)(n + 1) = 30(n + 1)
     \]

5. **Setting up the budget equation**:
   - Morgan has a budget of $90, so we set up the equation:
     \[
     30(n + 1) \leq 90
     \]

6. **Solving for \( n \)**:
   - Divide both sides by 30:
     \[
     n + 1 \leq 3
     \]
   - Subtract 1 from both sides:
     \[
     n \leq 2
     \]

- The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is given by \( 4x - 5 \).
- The number of customers kicked out for physical violence is \( 3 \) times the number of shoplifters.

Now, we can calculate the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting:

\[
\text{Shoplifters} = 4x - 5 = 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7
\]

Next, we calculate the number of customers kicked out for physical violence:

\[
\text{Physical violence} = 3 \times \text{Shoplifters} = 3 \times 7 = 21
\]

Now, we can find the total number of customers kicked out for the three reasons:

1. **Calculate the interest**: 
   The formula for simple interest is:
   \[
   \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   Here, the principal (amount borrowed) is $3,650, the rate is 10% (or 0.10), and the time is 5 months (which we convert to years for the calculation, so \( \frac{5}{12} \) years).

   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12}
   \]

   \[

   \]
   \[

   - The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour.
   - If Mel uses it for 8 hours a day, the daily energy consumption is:
     \[
     \text{Daily Energy Consumption} = 900 \, \text{watts} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watts-hours}
     \]

2. **Convert watts-hours to kilowatts-hours:**
   - Since 1 kilowatt = 1000 watts, we convert watts-hours to kilowatts-hours:
     \[
     \text{Daily Energy Consumption in kWh} = \frac{7200 \, \text{watts-hours}}{1000} = 7.2 \, \text{kWh}
     \]

3. **Calculate the new daily energy consumption after reducing usage:**
   - If Mel reduces the time by 5 hours, he will use the air conditioner for:
     \[
     8 \, \text{hours} - 5 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours}
     \]
   - The new daily energy consumption is:
     \[
     \text{New Daily Energy Consumption} = 900 \, \text{watts} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watts-hours}
     \]
   - Convert this to kilowatts-hours:
     \[
     \text{New Daily Energy Consumption in kWh} = \frac{2700 \, \text{watts-hours}}{1000} = 2.7 \, \text{kWh}
     \]

4. **Calculate the daily energy savings:**
   - The daily energy savings is the difference between the original and new daily consumption:
     \[
     \text{Daily Energy Savings} = 7.2 \, \text{kWh} - 2.7 \, \text{kWh} = 4.5 \, \text{kWh}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total savings over 30 days:**
   - Multiply the daily savings by 30 days:
     \[
     \text{Total Savings in 30 Days} = 4.5 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kWh}
     \]

Thus, Mel will save **135 kilowatt-hours** of electric energy in 30 days.",0.00188735,27.543996810913086,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,

- Therefore, the total number of apples Joanne gathers is:

Now, let's calculate how many apples her sister gathers:

- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- She gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.

1. **Initial Preparation**: The caterer prepared enough hotdogs for half of the guests to have two hotdogs each. Since there were originally 36 guests, half of that is:
   \[
   \text{Half of 36} = \frac{36}{2} = 18 \text{ guests}
   \]
   If these 18 guests each get 2 hotdogs, the total number of hotdogs prepared is:
   \[
   \text{Total hotdogs prepared} = 18 \times 2 = 36 \text{ hotdogs}

2. **Guests Who Showed Up**: However, 40 guests showed up, and all of them wanted a second hotdog. This means that each of the 40 guests would ideally want 2 hotdogs, leading to a total demand of:
   \[
   \text{Total hotdogs needed} = 40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ hotdogs}
   \]

3. **Comparison of Prepared vs. Needed Hotdogs**: The caterer prepared 36 hotdogs, but 80 hotdogs were needed. To find out how many guests did not get a second hotdog, we first calculate how many guests could be served with the 36 hotdogs:
   - Each guest can have 1 hotdog first, which accounts for 40 hotdogs needed for 40 guests.
   - After serving 1 hotdog to each of the 40 guests, there are still 36 hotdogs available.

4. **Distribution of Hotdogs**: Since there are only 36 hotdogs available, after giving each of the 40 guests 1 hotdog, there are:
   \[
   \text{Hotdogs remaining after first round} = 36 - 40 = -4 \text{ (not enough for everyone)}
   \]
   This means that all 36 hotdogs will be distributed, but not all guests will receive a second hotdog.

5. **Calculating Guests Who Did Not Get a Second Hotdog**: Since there are 40 guests and only 36 hotdogs available, we can serve 36 guests with a second hotdog. Thus, the number of guests who do not receive a second hotdog is:

   - The remoras' lengths are 6 inches each. Since there are 2 remoras, their total length is:
     \[
     2 \times 6 \text{ inches} = 12 \text{ inches}

     \]

3. **Calculate the percentage**:
   - The combined length of the remoras is 12 inches, and the length of the shark is 120 inches. The percentage can be calculated using the formula:

3. **Third Level (2 girls)**: Again, both girls are 64 inches tall.
   - Height contributed by the third level = 64 inches.

4. **Top Level (1 girl)**: The shortest girl, who is 60 inches tall, is at the top.
   - Height contributed by the top level = 60 inches.

Now, we add the heights of each level together:

\[
\text{Total height} = \text{Height of bottom level} + \text{Height of second level} + \text{Height of third level} + \text{Height of top level}
\]

\[
\text{Total height} = 64 + 64 + 64 + 60 = 252 \text{ inches}

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. The total number of insects collected is 43:
   \[
   L + D + B = 43
   \]

2. Lily found 7 more insects than David:
   \[
   L = D + 7
   \]

3. David found half of what Bodhi found:
   \[
   D = \frac{1}{2}B
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( L \) and \( D \) into the total equation.

First, substitute \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \) into the equation for \( L \):
\[
L = \frac{1}{2}B + 7
\]

Now substitute both \( L \) and \( D \) into the total equation:
\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}B + 7\right) + \left(\frac{1}{2}B\right) + B = 43
\]

Combine the terms:
\[
\frac{1}{2}B + 7 + \frac{1}{2}B + B = 43
\]
\[
(1 + 1)B + 7 = 43
\]
\[
2B + 7 = 43

2. **Determine Jame's cousin's age in 8 years**:
   Let \( x \) be Jame's cousin's current age. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be \( x + 8 \).

3. **Set up the equation based on the cousin's age**:
   According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. In 8 years, Jame will be:

According to the problem, we have the following relationships based on Richie's goals:

1. Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark:
   \[
   R = M + 20
   \]

2. Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna:
   \[
   R = A + 45
   \]

We know that Richie scored 80 goals, so we can substitute \( R \) with 80 in both equations:

1. From the first equation:
   \[
   80 = M + 20
   \]
   Solving for \( M \):
   \[
   M = 80 - 20 = 60
   \]

2. From the second equation:
   \[
   80 = A + 45
   \]
   Solving for \( A \):
   \[
   A = 80 - 45 = 35

Now we have the number of goals scored by each teenager:
- Richie: \( R = 80 \)
- Mark: \( M = 60 \)
- Anna: \( A = 35 \)

To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add their goals together:

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolate Marissa makes in one hour. According to the problem, Marissa makes \( \frac{3}{4} \) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in the two hours.

Now, we can calculate how much chocolate each of them makes in 12 hours.

1. **Calculate the cost of the more expensive coffee:**
   - The normal brand costs $5 per pound.
   - The more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand.
   - 20% of $5 is calculated as:
     \[
     0.20 \times 5 = 1
     \]
   - Therefore, the cost of the more expensive coffee is:
     \[
     5 + 1 = 6 \text{ dollars per pound}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of coffee for a week:**
   - Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day for 7 days, so he needs 7 pounds of coffee.
   - The total cost for 7 pounds of the more expensive coffee is:
     \[
     7 \times 6 = 42 \text{ dollars}

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. \( K = M - 5 \) (Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max)
2. \( M = C + 12 \) (Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster)
3. \( S = M + 23 \) (Summer has 23 more cookies than Max)
4. \( K = 68 \) (Katarina has 68 cookies)

Adding 5 to both sides:

\[
M = 68 + 5 = 73

Next, we can find \( C \) using the second equation:

Substituting \( M = 73 \):

\[
73 = C + 12
\]

Subtracting 12 from both sides:

\[

Now, we can find \( S \) using the third equation:

Topher's shoe length is 8 feet and 4 inches. We can convert this to inches as follows:

1. Convert feet to inches:
   \[
   8 \text{ feet} = 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ inches}

2. Add the additional inches:
   \[

   - Price per pound: $2.00
   - Pounds picked: 6
   - Total cost for peaches = 6 pounds × $2.00/pound = $12.00

2. **Cost of plums**:
   - Price per pound: $1.00
   - Pounds picked: 8
   - Total cost for plums = 8 pounds × $1.00/pound = $8.00

3. **Cost of apricots**:
   - Price per pound: $3.00
   - Pounds picked: 6
   - Total cost for apricots = 6 pounds × $3.00/pound = $18.00

Now, we add the total costs together:

- Total cost = Cost of peaches + Cost of plums + Cost of apricots
- Total cost = $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

Therefore, Winston spent a total of **$38.00** on fruit.",0.00201515,11.896454572677612,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,
gsm8k,gsm8k-779,TrustRoute-NoCost,3,"To find the distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot, we can break the problem down into two parts: the driving distance and the hiking distance.

1. **Driving Speed**: The family drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.

2. **Hiking Speed**: The hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half of their driving speed. 
   - Half of the driving speed: \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) miles per hour.
   - Therefore, the hiking speed is: \( 25 - 5 = 20 \) miles per hour.

3. **Time Spent Hiking**: It is given that they spent 1.5 hours hiking.

4. **Distance Hiked**: We can calculate the distance they hiked using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   So, the distance hiked is:
   \[
   \text{Distance hiked} = 20 \text{ miles/hour} \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Total Time for the Trip**: The total time for the trip is 6 hours, and they spent 1.5 hours hiking. Therefore, the time spent driving is:
   \[
   \text{Time driving} = 6 \text{ hours} - 1.5 \text{ hours} = 4.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

6. **Distance Driven**: We can calculate the distance driven using the same formula:
   \[
   \text{Distance driven} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   So, the distance driven is:
   \[
   \text{Distance driven} = 50 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4.5 \text{ hours} = 225 \text{ miles}
   \]

7. **Total Distance to Vacation Spot**: The total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance driven} + \text{Distance hiked} = 225 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 255 \text{ miles}

gsm8k,gsm8k-780,TrustRoute-NoCost,3,"Let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B \). 

Ava jumps on \( E + 8 \) enemies and collects \( B + 3 \) berries. 

The points for each player can be calculated as follows:

- **Emma's score**:
  \[
  \text{Score}_{\text{Emma}} = 10E + 5B + 30T
  \]
  where \( T \) is the time left on the timer when Emma finishes the level.

- **Ava's score**:
  \[
  \text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10(E + 8) + 5(B + 3) + 30(T - 4)
  \]

Now, let's simplify Ava's score:
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120
\]
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10E + 5B + 30T - 25
\]

Now we can express the difference between their scores:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} - \text{Score}_{\text{Emma}}
\]
Substituting the scores:
\[
\text{Difference} = (10E + 5B + 30T - 25) - (10E + 5B + 30T)
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = -25
\]

Thus, the difference between Ava's and Emma's scores is \(-25\). This means Ava's score is 25 points lower than Emma's score.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\text{The difference between their two scores is } 25 \text{ points, with Emma having the higher score.}

- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt.
- Since she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \).
- Since she uses twice as much oil as salt, the amount of oil is \( 2s \).
- Since she uses twice as much salt as zest, we have \( s = 2z \).

Now, we can express all ingredients in terms of \( z \):

1. Citrus zest: \( z \)
2. Fragrance: \( z \)
3. Salt: \( s = 2z \)
4. Sugar: \( s = 2z \)

   - 4 mirrors
   - 2 shelves
   - 1 chandelier
   - 10 pictures

2. **Items Angela Needs Installed**:
   - Mirrors: Angela has 6 mirrors. Since 4 are included in the base cost, she needs 2 additional mirrors installed.
   - Shelves: Angela has 0 shelves, so she does not need any additional shelves.
   - Chandeliers: Angela has 2 chandeliers. Since 1 is included in the base cost, she needs 1 additional chandelier installed.

- Let \( x \) be your age.
- Since you are three years younger than your brother, let your brother's age be \( x + 3 \).
- Since you are two years older than your sister, let your sister's age be \( x - 2 \).
- Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age, so her age can be expressed as \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \).

Now we can set up the equation for the sum of all ages:

\[
x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87
\]

Now, let's simplify this equation step by step:

1. Combine like terms:
   \[
   x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87
   \]
   \[
   x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87

   \[
   3x + 1 + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87
   \]
   \[
   3x + 1 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87
   \]
   \[
   6x + 9 = 87
   \]

2. Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   6x + 9 = 87

4. **Cost of apples**:
   - Each pack of apples is priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries. Since a pack of strawberries costs $4, the cost of one pack of apples is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of one pack of apples} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost for apples is:

3. **Rabbits**: He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs.

1. **Total cups of tea**: Lana has 27 cups.
2. **Cinnamon tea cups**: She brews a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea.

Now, we can find out how many cups are left for chamomile and mint tea:

\[
\text{Cups left for chamomile and mint tea} = \text{Total cups} - \text{Cinnamon tea cups} = 27 - 15 = 12 \text{ cups}
\]

3. **Dividing the remaining cups**: Lana divides these 12 cups into 3 rows, with equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea in each row. 

Let \( x \) be the number of cups of chamomile tea in each row, and since the amount of mint tea is equal to the amount of chamomile tea in each row, it will also be \( x \). Therefore, in each row, there are \( 2x \) cups of tea (chamomile + mint).

4. **Total cups in 3 rows**: Since there are 3 rows, the total number of cups for chamomile and mint tea is:

\[
3 \times 2x = 6x
\]

5. **Setting up the equation**: We know that the total cups for chamomile and mint tea is 12, so we can set up the equation:

\[
6x = 12
\]

6. **Solving for \( x \)**:

\[
x = \frac{12}{6} = 2
\]

This means there are 2 cups of chamomile tea in each row and 2 cups of mint tea in each row.

7. **Finding the number of mint tea cups in each row**: Since the amount of mint tea is equal to the amount of chamomile tea in each row, there are also 2 cups of mint tea in each row.

Thus, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:

   \[
   P + A + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   A = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = A + J

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( P \) into the first equation.

Substituting \( A = J + 10 \) into the equation for \( P \):
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now, substitute \( P \) and \( A \) into the combined age equation:

Combine like terms:

   - James swims 60% of the total distance of 20 miles.
   \[
   \text{Distance swum} = 0.6 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to swim the first part:**
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.

   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to swim:**
   - After swimming 12 miles, the remaining distance is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the speed for the remaining distance:**

1. Deanna's age is 26.
2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna.

First, we can find Marcus's age:

- Since Deanna is 26, Marcus is:
  \[
  \text{Marcus's age} = \text{Deanna's age} - 5 = 26 - 5 = 21
  \]

Now, we know that Marcus is 21 years old. Next, we can find Leo's age:

- Since Marcus is half of Leo's age, we can express this as:
  \[
  \text{Marcus's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Leo's age}
  \]
  Substituting Marcus's age:
  \[
  21 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Leo's age}

To find Leo's age, we can multiply both sides by 2:
\[

gsm8k,gsm8k-950,TrustRoute-NoCost,3,"Let \( B \) be the points scored by Bahati, \( A \) be the points scored by Azibo, and \( D \) be the points scored by Dinar. We know the following:

1. The total points scored by the team is 45:
   \[
   B + A + D = 45
   \]

2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo:
   \[
   B = A + 20
   \]

3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar:
   \[
   B = D + 10
   \]

Now we can express \( D \) in terms of \( A \) using the equations we have. From the second equation, we can substitute \( B \) in the third equation:

Substituting \( B \) from the second equation into the third:
\[
A + 20 = D + 10
\]
Rearranging gives:
\[
D = A + 10
\]

Now we can substitute \( B \) and \( D \) in terms of \( A \) into the total points equation:
\[
(A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45
\]

Combining like terms:
\[
3A + 40 = 45
\]

Now, subtract 40 from both sides:
\[
3A = 5
\]

Dividing both sides by 3 gives:
\[
A = \frac{5}{3}
\]

Thus, Azibo scored \( \frac{5}{3} \) points. However, since points are typically whole numbers, let's check if we made any mistakes in the interpretation or calculations.

Let's re-evaluate the equations:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \)
2. \( B = A + 20 \)
3. \( B = D + 10 \)

Substituting \( B \) from the second equation into the total points equation:
\[
(A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
3A + 30 = 45
\]
Subtracting 30 from both sides gives:
\[
3A = 15
\]
Dividing by 3 gives:
\[
A = 5
\]

So, Azibo scored \( \boxed{5} \) points. 

To verify:
- If \( A = 5 \), then \( B = 5 + 20 = 25 \) and \( D = 25 - 10 = 15 \).
- Checking the total: \( 25 + 5 + 15 = 45 \), which is correct.

   \[
   8 \text{ hours} = 8 \times 60 = 480 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Waking Up Early**: On that particular day, Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual. Since she usually wakes up at 6 a.m., waking up 5 minutes earlier means she woke up at:

gsm8k,gsm8k-963,TrustRoute-NoCost,3,"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe as \( A \), \( S \), and \( D \) respectively. We are given the following information:

1. The total number of Pokemon caught by all three is 339:
   \[
   A + S + D = 339
   \]

2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan:
   \[
   A = S + 5
   \]

3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught:
   \[
   S = 4D - 13
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( S \) into the first equation.

First, substitute \( A \) from the second equation into the total:
\[
(S + 5) + S + D = 339
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2S + D + 5 = 339
\]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[
2S + D = 334
\]

Next, substitute \( S \) from the third equation into this equation:
\[
2(4D - 13) + D = 334
\]
Expanding this gives:
\[
8D - 26 + D = 334
\]
Combining like terms results in:
\[
9D - 26 = 334
\]
Adding 26 to both sides:
\[
9D = 360
\]
Dividing both sides by 9:
\[
D = 40
\]

Now that we have \( D \), we can find \( S \):
\[
S = 4D - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
\]

Finally, we can find \( A \):
\[
A = S + 5 = 147 + 5 = 152
\]

To verify, we check the total:
\[
A + S + D = 152 + 147 + 40 = 339
\]
This is correct.

Thus, the number of Pokemon Stan has caught is:

- Let \( x \) be the age of Bill when he saw the Comet for the first time.
- Let \( y \) be the age of Bill's dad when he saw the Comet for the first time, which is given as 30 years old.
- The Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, so after 75 years, Bill's dad will see the Comet again.

Now, we know that Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. 

1. Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old.
2. After 75 years, Bill's dad will be \( 30 + 75 = 105 \) years old.
3. The age of Bill when he saw the Comet for the second time is \( 3 \times 30 = 90 \) years old.

Now, we need to find out how old Bill was when he saw the Comet for the first time.

Since Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30, and Bill saw it again when he was 90, we can calculate the time that has passed since the first sighting of the Comet:

- The time between the first and second sightings of the Comet is 75 years (the orbit period of the Comet).

Now, we can express Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time in terms of the time that has passed:

- Let \( t \) be the time that has passed since Bill's dad saw the Comet until Bill saw it for the first time. Then, we have:
  \[
  x + t = 90
  \]
  and
  \[
  y + t = 30 + 75 = 105
  \]

Since \( y = 30 \), we can substitute:
\[
30 + t = 105
\]
Solving for \( t \):
\[
t = 105 - 30 = 75
\]

Now substituting \( t \) back into the equation for Bill's age:
\[

According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. Therefore, the number of flights to Greece is:

\[
\frac{3}{4}x
\]

The remaining flights, which are one-quarter of the total flights, are:

\[
x - \frac{3}{4}x = \frac{1}{4}x
\]

These remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. Thus, the number of flights to France is:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{4}x \right) = \frac{1}{8}x
\]

Now, we also know that the second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
44 = \frac{1}{2}x

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides by 2:

2. **Chikote's howl**: 
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.

We know the total age of the children is 20 years:

\[

Substituting the known ages of Akbar and Alessandro:

\[

In this case:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) (initial price),

2. **Probability of having the normal teacher (N)**: 50% (or 0.5)
   - If the normal teacher is present, there are two sub-scenarios:
     - **Probability of getting an extension (E)**: 40% (or 0.4)
       - If the teacher gives an extension, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.
     - **Probability of not getting an extension (¬E)**: 60% (or 0.6)
       - If the teacher does not give an extension, there are further sub-scenarios:
         - **Probability of convincing the teacher for a personal extension (C)**: 20% (or 0.2)
           - If he convinces the teacher, he does not have to turn in his homework.
         - **Probability of not convincing the teacher (¬C)**: 80% (or 0.8)
           - If he cannot convince the teacher, he has to turn in his homework.

Now, let's calculate the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:

1. **If there is a substitute teacher (S)**: 
   - Probability of having to turn in homework = 0% (since he doesn't have to turn it in).

2. **If there is the normal teacher (N)**:
   - Probability of getting an extension (E) = 0.4 → does not have to turn in homework.
   - Probability of not getting an extension (¬E) = 0.6:
     - Probability of convincing the teacher (C) = 0.2 → does not have to turn in homework.
     - Probability of not convincing the teacher (¬C) = 0.8 → has to turn in homework.

Now, we can calculate the total probability of having to turn in homework when the normal teacher is present:

- Probability of having to turn in homework with the normal teacher:
  - P(¬E) * P(¬C) = 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.48

Now, we combine the probabilities for both scenarios (substitute teacher and normal teacher):

- Total probability of having to turn in homework:
  - P(S) * P(turn in homework | S) + P(N) * P(turn in homework | N)
  - = 0.5 * 0 + 0.5 * 0.48
  - = 0 + 0.24
  - = 0.24

Finally, to express this as a percentage:

- Probability of having to turn in homework = 0.24 * 100% = 24%

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is **24%**.",0.00591455,17.84856605529785,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,

The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is given as 19. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[

\]

Now, let's simplify the equation step by step:

1. Combine like terms:
   \[

2. To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 2:

   - Total bananas = Number of bunches × Average bananas per bunch
   \[
   \text{Total bananas} = 10 \times 4 = 40 \text{ bananas}

The total amount of fence they have is 100 feet, which gives us the equation:

\[
S + H = 100
\]

Substituting the expression for \( H \) into the equation, we get:

\[
S + (S + 60) = 100

   - John has 6 periods each day, and each period is 40 minutes long.
   - Total minutes per day in regular classes = 6 periods × 40 minutes/period = 240 minutes.
   - Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, total minutes in regular classes for the week = 240 minutes/day × 5 days = 1200 minutes.

2. **Calculate the total minutes spent in extra classes:**
   - John has 2 extra classes, each lasting 40 minutes.
   - Total minutes for extra classes per day = 2 classes × 40 minutes/class = 80 minutes.
   - Total minutes in extra classes for the week = 80 minutes/day × 5 days = 400 minutes.

3. **Calculate the total minutes spent in learning during the week:**
   - Total minutes spent learning = minutes in regular classes + minutes in extra classes = 1200 minutes + 400 minutes = 1600 minutes.

4. **Calculate the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - Total weekly minutes = 7 days × 24 hours/day × 60 minutes/hour = 10080 minutes.
   - Extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday = 1/16 of total weekly minutes.
   - Extra learning time = (1/16) × 10080 minutes = 630 minutes.

Next, we know that Camden and Sarah together painted a total of 30 eggs. Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Sarah as \( y \). Therefore, Camden painted \( y + 12 \) eggs (since Camden painted 12 more than Sarah).

The equation for Camden and Sarah's total is:

\[

gsm8k,gsm8k-1168,TrustRoute-NoCost,3,"Let's denote the lengths of the ropes as follows:

- Let \( r \) be the length of the red rope.
- Let \( b \) be the length of the blue rope.
- Let \( y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope:
   \[
   r = 4b
   \]

2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope:
   \[
   b = y - 7
   \]

3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters:
   \[
   r + b + y = 37
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( r \) and \( b \) into the combined length equation.

Substituting \( r = 4b \) into the combined length equation:
\[
4b + b + y = 37
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
5b + y = 37
\]

Next, we substitute \( b = y - 7 \) into the equation \( 5b + y = 37 \):
\[
5(y - 7) + y = 37
\]
Expanding this gives:
\[
5y - 35 + y = 37
\]
Combining like terms:
\[
6y - 35 = 37
\]
Adding 35 to both sides:
\[
6y = 72
\]
Dividing by 6:
\[
y = 12
\]

Now that we have the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
\[
b = y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5
\]

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope:
\[
r = 4b = 4 \times 5 = 20
\]

Thus, the length of the red rope is \( \boxed{20} \) centimeters.",0.00317495,11.44935655593872,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,

\[
\text{Total of red, white, and purple} = x + x + x = 3x
\]

According to the problem, half of the mural is yellow. Therefore, the amount of yellow paint used is:

\[

   \text{Chalk used on Monday} = 0.45 \times 5 \text{ inches} = 2.25 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday:**
   \[

gsm8k,gsm8k-1181,TrustRoute-NoCost,3,"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information that we can translate into equations:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now:
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7)
   \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now:
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} W
   \]

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} W \)

Let's solve these equations step by step.

### Step 1: Substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation.

From the first equation:
\[
W = 5(C + 7)
\]

Substituting this into the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5(C + 7))
\]

### Step 2: Simplify the equation.

Expanding the right side:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7)
\]

### Step 3: Clear the fraction by multiplying through by 3.
\[
3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7)
\]

Expanding both sides:
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

### Step 4: Rearranging the equation.
Now, let's move all terms involving \( C \) to one side and constant terms to the other side:
\[
75 - 35 = 5C - 3C
\]
\[
40 = 2C
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( C \).
\[
C = \frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

### Conclusion
Colin is currently \( \boxed{20} \) years old.

### Verification
To verify, we can calculate Wendy's age:
- From \( W = 5(C + 7) \):
  \[
  W = 5(20 + 7) = 5 \times 27 = 135
  \]

Now check the second condition:
- In 25 years, Colin will be \( 20 + 25 = 45 \).
- Wendy's current age is 135, and a third of that is:
  \[
  \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45
  \]

Both conditions are satisfied, confirming that Colin's current age is indeed \( \boxed{20} \).",0.00418045,20.26304316520691,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,

1. **Calculate the selling price**:
   Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them for. If she bought the magazines for $72, the selling price can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72

gsm8k,gsm8k-1209,TrustRoute-NoCost,3,"To find the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we first need to determine how much water is removed at each setting:

1. **Low setting**: Removes 1 liter per day.
2. **Medium setting**: Removes twice as much as the low setting, which is \(2 \times 1 = 2\) liters per day.
3. **High setting**: Removes twice as much as the medium setting, which is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) liters per day.

Next, we calculate the total amount of water removed for each setting over the specified number of days:

- **Low setting for 3 days**:
  \[

1. **First 30 seconds:**
   - Number of pops = 20

2. **Next 30 seconds:**
   - Number of pops = 3 times the first 30 seconds
   - Number of pops = 3 * 20 = 60

3. **Next 30 seconds:**
   - Popping rate increases to 4 times the initial rate (which is 20)
   - Number of pops = 4 * 20 = 80

4. **Final 30 seconds:**
   - Popping slows down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds (which was 80)
   - Number of pops = 80 / 2 = 40

Now, let's sum up the total number of pops during the cooking time:

1. **Calculate the total amount of lemonade Tim needs:**
   - Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade for the party.
   - Allen wants an extra gallon, making it a total of \(4 + 1 = 5\) gallons.

2. **Determine the amount of lemon juice needed:**
   - The recipe calls for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice per gallon.
   - Therefore, for 5 gallons, Tim will need \(5 \text{ cups of lemon juice}\).

3. **Calculate the number of lemons needed for the 5 gallons:**
   - Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, to find out how many lemons are needed for 5 cups, we can set up the following calculation:
   \[
   \text{Number of lemons for 5 cups} = 5 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 30 \text{ lemons}
   \]

4. **Adjust for the extra gallon that is twice as tart:**
   - The extra gallon that Allen wants is twice as tart. This means it will require twice the amount of lemon juice compared to the regular gallons.
   - Therefore, for the extra gallon, Tim will need \(2 \text{ cups of lemon juice}\).

5. **Calculate the total lemon juice needed:**
   - For the 4 gallons, he needs 4 cups of lemon juice.
   - For the extra gallon, he needs 2 cups of lemon juice.
   - Total lemon juice needed is \(4 + 2 = 6 \text{ cups}\).

6. **Calculate the total number of lemons needed:**

1. **Total Cookies Made**: 7995
2. **Rainbow Cookies**: 2595
3. **Oatmeal Cookies**: 3075

Now, we can calculate the number of chocolate chip cookies by subtracting the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies:

\[
\text{Chocolate Chip Cookies} = \text{Total Cookies} - (\text{Rainbow Cookies} + \text{Oatmeal Cookies})
\]

- Test tubes: \( T = 16 \)
- Beakers: \( B = 7 \)
- Petri dishes: \( P = 14 \)

Now, according to the problem, Igor gathered:

- Half as many test tubes as requested: \( \frac{T}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \)
- Two more than the number of Petri dishes requested: \( P + 2 = 14 + 2 = 16 \)
- The correct number of beakers: \( B = 7 \)

However, he lost some beakers on the way to the lab bench. Let's denote the number of beakers Igor lost as \( x \). Therefore, the number of beakers he actually placed on the bench is \( 7 - x \).

Now, we can set up the equation for the total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench:

\[
\text{Total items} = \text{Test tubes} + \text{Beakers} + \text{Petri dishes}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[

1. **Understanding the speeds**:
   - Let \( v \) be Vanessa's speed in miles per minute.
   - Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, his speed is \( 2v \).

2. **Distance run**:
   - We know that Vanessa ran 4 miles.
   - Since Vanessa can run twice as far as Aaron, we can denote the distance Aaron ran as \( d \). Therefore, \( d = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.

3. **Time taken by Aaron**:
   - Aaron completed his part of the race (2 miles) in 16 minutes.
   - We can find Aaron's speed using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{8} \text{ miles per minute}

We have two equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of animals:
   \[

2. The total number of legs:
   Chickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each, so:
   \[
   2C + 4W = 70

Now we have a system of equations:
