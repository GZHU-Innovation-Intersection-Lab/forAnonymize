1. **Calculate the total investment**: This includes the purchase price of the house and the cost of repairs.
   - Purchase price: $80,000
   - Repairs: $50,000
   - Total investment = Purchase price + Repairs = $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

2. **Calculate the increased value of the house**: The value of the house increased by 150%. 
   - Increased value = Original value + (150% of Original value)
   - Original value = Purchase price = $80,000

### Step 1: Analyze the original orange drink
- You have 10 liters of orange drink, which is two-thirds water.
- Water in the orange drink:  
  \((2/3) \times 10 = 20/3 \approx 6.67\) liters.
- Non-water (e.g., orange concentrate) in the orange drink:  
  \(10 - 20/3 = (30/3 - 20/3) = 10/3 \approx 3.33\) liters.

### Step 2: Account for the spill
- You spill 1 liter of the orange drink. Assuming the spilled portion has the same composition as the whole (two-thirds water), the spilled liquid contains:
  - Water: \((2/3) \times 1 = 2/3 \approx 0.67\) liters.
  - Non-water: \((1/3) \times 1 = 1/3 \approx 0.33\) liters.
- Water left in the orange drink:  
  \(20/3 - 2/3 = 18/3 = 6\) liters.
- Non-water left in the orange drink:  
  \(10/3 - 1/3 = 9/3 = 3\) liters.
- Total orange drink left: 6 liters water + 3 liters non-water = 9 liters.

### Step 3: Analyze the pineapple drink
- You have 15 liters of pineapple drink, which is three-fifths water.
- Water in the pineapple drink:  
  \((3/5) \times 15 = 45/5 = 9\) liters.
- Non-water in the pineapple drink:  
  \(15 - 9 = 6\) liters.

  Water from orange drink + Water from pineapple drink = 6 liters + 9 liters = 15 liters.
- Total non-water in the mixture:  
  Non-water from orange drink + Non-water from pineapple drink = 3 liters + 6 liters = 9 liters.

### Step 1: Understand the problem
- Kyle bought the book for $19.50 after a 25% discount.
- A 25% discount means he paid 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

### Step 2: Set up the equation
- Let the original price be \( P \).
- 75% of \( P \) equals $19.50.
- In mathematical terms: \( 0.75 \times P = 19.50 \).

### Step 3: Solve for \( P \)
- Divide both sides by 0.75:  
  \( P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \)
- Performing the calculation:  
  \( 19.50 \div 0.75 = 26 \)

### Step 4: Verify the solution

gsm8k,gsm8k-25,TrustRoute,1,"Let me help you solve this step by step. We're trying to determine how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered based on the total amount she paid.

### Step 1: List the costs of the items
- Chicken meal: 1 × $12 = $12
- Packs of milk: 5 × $3 = $15
- Apples: 4 × $1.50 = $6
- Boxes of pizza: Let’s say she ordered \( x \) boxes, and each costs $8.50, so the total cost for pizza is \( x \times 8.50 \).

### Step 2: Set up the equation
The total amount paid is $50. So, we can write:
\[
12 + 15 + 6 + (x \times 8.50) = 50
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the equation
First, add the known costs:
\[
12 + 15 + 6 = 33
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
33 + (x \times 8.50) = 50
\]

Subtract 33 from both sides:
\[
x \times 8.50 = 50 - 33
\]
\[
x \times 8.50 = 17
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)
Divide both sides by 8.50:
\[
x = \frac{17}{8.50} = 2
\]

### Step 5: Verify the solution
If \( x = 2 \):
- Cost of pizza: 2 × $8.50 = $17
- Total cost: $12 + $15 + $6 + $17 = $50

This matches the total amount paid, so the calculation is correct.

### Final Answer
Marie ordered **2 boxes of pizza**.",0.0061476,11.95898962020874,0,0,cand-grok-3-mini,stage2_vote,

1. **Cost of shorts**:
   - Number of pairs of shorts = 3
   - Cost of one pair of shorts = $16.50
   - Total cost for shorts = 3 pairs × $16.50/pair = $49.50

2. **Cost of pants**:
   - Number of pairs of pants = 3
   - Cost of one pair of pants = $22.50
   - Total cost for pants = 3 pairs × $22.50/pair = $67.50

3. **Cost of shoes**:
   - Number of pairs of shoes = 3
   - Cost of one pair of shoes = $42.00
   - Total cost for shoes = 3 pairs × $42.00/pair = $126.00

Now, we can add the total costs together:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost for shorts} + \text{Total cost for pants} + \text{Total cost for shoes}

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of coins is 110:
   G + S = 110

2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins:
   G = S + 30

Now we can solve this system of two equations.
Substitute the second equation (G = S + 30) into the first equation:
(S + 30) + S = 110
2S + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:
2S = 110 - 30
2S = 80

Divide by 2 to find the number of silver coins:
S = 80 / 2
S = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using G = S + 30:
G = 40 + 30
G = 70

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - We know that Dana can skip at a speed of 3 miles per hour.
   - According to the problem, her skipping speed is half of her running speed. Therefore, if we let \( r \) be her running speed, we have:
     \[
     \frac{r}{2} = 3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad r = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Dana's running speed is four times her walking speed. Let \( w \) be her walking speed. Then:
     \[
     r = 4w \quad \Rightarrow \quad 6 = 4w \quad \Rightarrow \quad w = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour}

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Dana spends one-third of her time running and two-thirds of her time walking over a total of 6 hours.
   - Time spent running:
     \[
     \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Time spent walking:
     \[
     \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running and walking:**
   - Distance traveled while running:
     \[
     \text{Distance running} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles}

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Calculate the weight of the comic books being removed:**  
   Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, and he's removing 30 of them.  
   Weight removed from comic books = 30 × (1/4) = 30 × 0.25 = 7.5 pounds.

2. **Determine the remaining weight to remove:**  
   He needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, so the weight left to remove is:  
   15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

3. **Calculate the number of toys needed:**  
   Each toy weighs 1/2 pound (or 0.5 pounds). To remove 7.5 pounds from toys:  
   Number of toys = 7.5 ÷ 0.5 = 15.

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove **15 toys** to reach a total of 15 pounds removed.",0.00408856,15.817753076553345,0,0,cand-grok-3-mini,stage2_confidence,

**Given information:**
- Bridge weight limit: 5000 pounds
- Weight of each box: 15 pounds
- Weight of driver + empty truck: 3755 pounds

**Step-by-step solution:**

1) First, I'll find how much weight capacity is available for boxes:

Let me set up the problem:
- Total games played = 22
- Let's say they lost L games
- They won W games
- They won 8 more than they lost, so: W = L + 8

Since all games were either won or lost (assuming no ties):
W + L = 22

Now I can substitute W = L + 8 into this equation:

Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we need to subtract twice the wall thickness from each dimension to find the inner dimensions:

Let \( x \) represent the number of cookies Henry baked last year.

- Henry intended to bake twice as many as last year, so he planned to bake \( 2x \) cookies.
- However, he actually baked 15 more than intended, so he baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.
- After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, leaving him with \( (2x + 15) - 5 \) cookies.
- We know he ended up with 110 cookies, so we can set up the equation:

  (2x + 15) - 5 = 110

1. We know Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
2. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times as many photographs as Brittany's phone.  
   So, if we let \( B \) represent the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold, then:  
   \( 1800 = 6 \times B \)  
   Solving for \( B \):  
   \( B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \)  
   Therefore, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.
3. The maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold (300) is 50 times the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. (Note: The problem mentions ""birds,"" but since the photograph is described as one of ducks, I'll assume this refers to ducks for consistency.)

- Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%
- Both salaries increased simultaneously (by the same percentage)

**Step 1: Find Lylah's salary 4 years ago**

If Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's:
- Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary × 1.30
- $40,000 = Lylah's salary × 1.30
- Lylah's salary = $40,000 ÷ 1.30
- Lylah's salary = $30,769.23 (approximately)

**Step 2: Find Adrien's salary four years later**

Adrien's new salary = $40,000 × 1.40 = $56,000

**Step 3: Find the percentage increase**

Since both salaries increased simultaneously (by the same percentage):
- Percentage increase = 40%

**Step 4: Find Lylah's salary four years later**

Lylah's new salary = $30,769.23 × 1.40 = $43,076.92 (approximately)

Let me define variables:
- Let q = number of queen bees
- Let b = number of baby bees
- Let w = number of worker bees

Now I'll set up equations based on the given information:

1. Total bees: q + b + w = 700
2. ""Twice as many worker bees as baby bees"": w = 2b
3. ""Twice as many babies as queens"": b = 2q

Now I'll solve by substitution:

From equation 3: b = 2q
From equation 2: w = 2b = 2(2q) = 4q

Substituting into equation 1:
q + 2q + 4q = 700
7q = 700
q = 100

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard football field. Each back-and-forth trip consists of running 100 yards to one end and 100 yards back, which totals 200 yards per trip.

So, for 15 trips:
\[
\text{Distance Blake runs} = 15 \times 200 \text{ yards} = 3000 \text{ yards}
\]

**Kelly's Distance:**
Kelly runs back and forth once on the 100-yard field, which is:
\[
\text{Distance for 1 trip} = 200 \text{ yards}
\]

After that, she runs to the 40-yard line and back. The distance to the 40-yard line is 40 yards, and the distance back is also 40 yards, making a round trip to the 40-yard line:
\[
\text{Distance for 1 round trip to 40-yard line} = 40 + 40 = 80 \text{ yards}
\]

Kelly does this 34 times:
\[
\text{Distance Kelly runs to 40-yard line} = 34 \times 80 \text{ yards} = 2720 \text{ yards}

Now, we add the distance Kelly ran initially (200 yards) to the distance she ran to the 40-yard line:

gsm8k,gsm8k-164,TrustRoute,1,"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant compared to doing her taxes herself, let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of doing taxes herself
- If Jackie does her taxes herself, she loses 3 hours of freelance work.
- Her freelance rate is $35 per hour.
- Total lost income: 3 hours × $35/hour = $105.

So, the net cost of doing it herself is $105 (in lost income).

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of hiring the accountant
- The accountant charges a flat fee of $90.
- By hiring the accountant, Jackie doesn't lose the 3 hours of freelance work, so she can still earn the $105 from that work.

So, the net cost of hiring the accountant is just the $90 fee, but she gains back the $105 in freelance income.

### Step 3: Compare the two options
- If she does it herself: She loses $105 in income.
- If she hires the accountant: She pays $90 but keeps the $105 in income.
- Net difference: The cost of doing it herself ($105) minus the cost of hiring ($90) = $105 - $90 = $15.

In other words, by hiring the accountant, Jackie saves $15 compared to doing it herself.

### Final Answer
Jackie will have **$15 more money** if she hires the accountant. This is because the accountant's fee is less than the income she would lose by doing the taxes herself.",0.0035626900000000003,22.770091772079468,0,0,cand-grok-3-mini,stage2_confidence,

From the first statement: ""Seth is twice as old as Brooke.""
S = 2B  (Equation 1)

From the second statement: ""In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28.""
In 2 years, Seth will be S + 2 years old.
In 2 years, Brooke will be B + 2 years old.
So, (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28
S + B + 4 = 28
S + B = 24 (Equation 2)

Now we have a system of two equations:
1) S = 2B
2) S + B = 24

Substitute Equation 1 into Equation 2:
(2B) + B = 24
3B = 24
B = 24 / 3
B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age (B=8), we can find Seth's age using Equation 1:

S = 2 * 8
S = 16

So, Seth is 16 years old.

Let's check the answer:
Seth's current age = 16
Brooke's current age = 8
Seth is twice as old as Brooke (16 = 2 * 8). This is correct.

In 2 years:

   \text{Jenna's apples} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Mom's apples} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
   \]

3. Now, we can find the total number of apples they both picked:
   \[
   \text{Total apples} = \text{Mom's apples} + \text{Jenna's apples} = 20 + 10 = 30
   \]

Thus, Jenna and her mother picked a total of 30 apples.",0.0008609500000000001,6.4419074058532715,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,
gsm8k,gsm8k-186,TrustRoute,1,"To solve the problem, we need to break down the distribution of straw among the different types of rodents.

1. **Rats**: 
   - Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage.
   - There are 3 cages of rats, so the total number of rats is \( 3r \).
   - Each rat receives 6 pieces of straw, so the total straw given to the rats is:
     \[
     \text{Straw for rats} = 3r \times 6 = 18r
     \]

2. **Hamsters**:
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster receives 5 pieces of straw.
   - Let \( h \) be the number of hamsters in each cage.
   - The total number of hamsters is \( 10h \).
   - The total straw given to the hamsters is:
     \[
     \text{Straw for hamsters} = 10h \times 5 = 50h
     \]

3. **Rabbits**:
   - The problem states that 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

4. **Total Straw Distributed**:
   - According to the problem, the total straw distributed among all rodents is 160 pieces. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     18r + 50h + 20 = 160
     \]

5. **Simplifying the Equation**:
   - Subtract 20 from both sides:
     \[
     18r + 50h = 140
     \]

6. **Finding Possible Values**:
   - We can now find integer values for \( r \) and \( h \) that satisfy this equation. We can express \( h \) in terms of \( r \):
     \[
     50h = 140 - 18r
     \]
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18r}{50}
     \]

   - For \( h \) to be an integer, \( 140 - 18r \) must be divisible by 50. We can test integer values for \( r \):

   - **Testing \( r = 0 \)**:
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 0}{50} = 2.8 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]

   - **Testing \( r = 1 \)**:
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18}{50} = \frac{122}{50} = 2.44 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]

   - **Testing \( r = 2 \)**:
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 36}{50} = \frac{104}{50} = 2.08 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]

   - **Testing \( r = 3 \)**:
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 54}{50} = \frac{86}{50} = 1.72 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]

   - **Testing \( r = 4 \)**:
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 72}{50} = \frac{68}{50} = 1.36 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]

   - **Testing \( r = 5 \)**:
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 90}{50} = \frac{50}{50} = 1 \quad \text{(integer)}
     \]

   - **Testing \( r = 6 \)**:
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 108}{50} = \frac{32}{50} = 0.64 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]

   - **Testing \( r = 7 \)**:
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 126}{50} = \frac{14}{50} = 0.28 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]

   - **Testing \( r = 8 \)**:
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 144}{50} = \frac{-4}{50} \quad \text{(not valid)}
     \]

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The only valid solution found is when \( r = 5 \) and \( h = 1 \). Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is:

gsm8k,gsm8k-187,TrustRoute,1,"To calculate how much Mandy should pay Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can use the formula for compound interest:

\[ A = P(1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n months, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (as a decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of months the money is borrowed.

In this case:
- \( P = 100 \) (the amount owed)
- \( r = 0.02 \) (2% interest)
- \( n = 3 \) (the number of months)

Now, we can plug in the values:

2. **Cost of transportation**: The cost to transport each bag is $2, so the total transportation cost is:
   \[
   \text{Transportation cost} = 2x
   \]

3. **Total cost**: The total cost incurred by the trader is the sum of the cost of the bags and the transportation cost:
   \[
