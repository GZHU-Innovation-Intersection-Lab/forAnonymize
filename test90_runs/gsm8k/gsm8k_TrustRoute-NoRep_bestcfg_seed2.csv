1. **Cost of the jacket**: $30
2. **Cost of each pair of shoes**: $20

Next, let's calculate how much money Sara has after babysitting and how much she needs to mow the lawn.

1. **Earnings from babysitting**: She babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time:

gsm8k,gsm8k-211,TrustRoute-NoRep,2,"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, so the total egg production from red chickens is \( 3r \).
2. The white chickens produce 5 eggs a day, so the total egg production from white chickens is \( 5w \).
3. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs every day, which gives us the equation:
   \[
   3r + 5w = 42
   \]
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which gives us the equation:
   \[
   w = r + 2
   \]

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation. Replacing \( w \) in the first equation gives us:
\[
3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
\]

Now, simplify the equation:
\[
3r + 5r + 10 = 42
\]
\[
8r + 10 = 42
\]

Next, subtract 10 from both sides:
\[
8r = 32
\]

Now, divide by 8:
\[
r = 4
\]

Now that we have the number of red chickens, we can find the number of white chickens using the equation \( w = r + 2 \):
\[
w = 4 + 2 = 6
\]

Thus, Jerry has:
- **4 red chickens**
- **6 white chickens**

To verify, we can check the total egg production:
- From red chickens: \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) eggs
- From white chickens: \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \) eggs
- Total: \( 12 + 30 = 42 \) eggs, which matches the given information.

According to the problem, now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:

1. **Initial Count**: Griffin starts with 24 french fries.

2. **Kyle's Action**: Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   \text{Fries left with Griffin} = 24 - 5 = 19
   \]

3. **Billy's Action**: Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle. Since Kyle took 5 fries, Billy took:
   \[
   \text{Fries taken by Billy} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]
   Now, Griffin has:
   \[
   \text{Fries left with Griffin} = 19 - 10 = 9
   \]

4. **Ginger's Action**: Let \( x \) be the number of fries that Ginger gave to Griffin. After receiving fries from Ginger, Griffin has:
   \[
   \text{Fries with Griffin} = 9 + x
   \]

5. **Colby's Action**: Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken. Since Kyle took 5 fries, Colby took:
   \[
   \text{Fries taken by Colby} = 5 - 3 = 2
   \]
   After Colby took 2 fries, Griffin has:
   \[
   \text{Fries with Griffin} = (9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x

6. **Final Count**: We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

   where \( A_A \) is the number of apples Andrea has.

2. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal:
   \[
   B_A = \frac{1}{2} B_J

   where \( B_A \) is the number of bananas Andrea has.

3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples:
   \[
   B_J = A_J + 4
   \]

We know from the problem that Andrea has 52 apples:
\[
A_A = 52
\]

Using the first equation, we can find the number of apples Jamal has:
\[
52 = A_J + 8
\]
Subtracting 8 from both sides gives:
\[
A_J = 52 - 8 = 44
\]

Now we can use the third equation to find the number of bananas Jamal has:
\[
B_J = A_J + 4 = 44 + 4 = 48
\]

Next, we can find the number of bananas Andrea has using the second equation:
\[
B_A = \frac{1}{2} B_J = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24

   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms for one house is:
     \[
     3 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows}

   \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
   \[

Now we can substitute the first equation into the second equation. 

Substituting \( R \) in the second equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Now, let's simplify the right side:

The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed:

\[
\text{Speed of the slow lane car} = \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour}

1. **Determine the number of medals Izzy has**:
   - Ali has 22 medals.
   - Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali.
   - Therefore, Izzy's medals = 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

2. **Calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together**:
   - Total medals = Ali's medals + Izzy's medals = 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

3. **Relate their total medals to the total medals given out for counting**:
   - According to the problem, together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting.
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of medals given out for counting.

gsm8k,gsm8k-314,TrustRoute-NoRep,2,"Let the number of players on the defense be \( d \).

According to the problem:

1. The number of players on the offense is \( 2d \) (twice as many as on the defense).
2. The number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{d}{2} \) (half the number of players on the defense).

The total number of members in the team is given as 105. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
d + 2d + \frac{d}{2} = 105
\]

Now, combine the terms on the left side:

\[
3d + \frac{d}{2} = 105
\]

To combine \( 3d \) and \( \frac{d}{2} \), we can express \( 3d \) as \( \frac{6d}{2} \):

\[
\frac{6d}{2} + \frac{d}{2} = 105
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{7d}{2} = 105
\]

Next, multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

\[
7d = 210
\]

Now, divide both sides by 7:

\[
d = 30
\]

Thus, the number of players on the defense is \( \boxed{30} \). 

To verify:

- Players on offense: \( 2d = 2 \times 30 = 60 \)
- Players on special teams: \( \frac{d}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \)

Adding these together:

gsm8k,gsm8k-359,TrustRoute-NoRep,2,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the gumballs:**
   - Each gumball costs $0.05.
   - If Billy bought 40 gumballs, the total cost for the gumballs is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of gumballs} = 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the change Billy has after buying gumballs:**
   - Billy started with $10.
   - After spending $2 on gumballs, his remaining money is:
     \[
     \text{Remaining money} = 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Determine how much change he had before buying gumballs:**
   - Since he took half of his change to buy gumballs, before buying gumballs, he had:
     \[
     \text{Change before gumballs} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate how much he spent on candy:**
   - Since he had $10 initially and he had $16 before buying gumballs, he must have spent:
     \[
     \text{Cost of candy} = 10 - 16 = -6 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - This indicates a mistake in our calculations. Let's re-evaluate the change after buying candy.

5. **Let \( x \) be the pounds of candy he bought:**
   - The cost of the candy is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of candy} = 1.5x
     \]
   - After buying candy, his remaining money is:
     \[
     \text{Remaining money after candy} = 10 - 1.5x
     \]

6. **Since he spent half of his remaining money on gumballs:**
   - The amount spent on gumballs is:
     \[
     \text{Amount spent on gumballs} = \frac{10 - 1.5x}{2}
     \]
   - We know from step 1 that this amount equals $2:
     \[
     \frac{10 - 1.5x}{2} = 2
     \]

7. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Multiply both sides by 2:
     \[
     10 - 1.5x = 4
     \]
   - Rearranging gives:
     \[
     1.5x = 10 - 4
     \]
     \[
     1.5x = 6
     \]

   - Distance = 75 miles

2. **Calculate the distance from the second city to the third city:**
   - Distance = 100 miles

3. **Calculate the distance from the third city back to the first city:**
   - The combined distance from the first city to the second city and from the second city to the third city is:

- The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is \( 4x - 5 \).
- The number of customers kicked out for physical violence is \( 3 \) times the number of shoplifters.

Now, we can calculate the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting:

\[
\text{Shoplifters} = 4x - 5 = 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7
\]

Next, we calculate the number of customers kicked out for physical violence:

From the problem, we know:
- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- She gathers half of that from the shortest trees, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
- Therefore, the total number of apples Joanne gathers is:
  \[
  30 + 15 + x = 45 + x
  \]

Now, let's look at her sister's gathering:
- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- She gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- Her sister does not gather any apples from the average trees.

Thus, the total number of apples her sister gathers is:

Now, we can set up the equation for the combined total of apples gathered by both sisters:

Let:
- \( c \) = number of camels
- \( d \) = number of dromedaries

From the problem, we know:
1. Each animal has one head, so the total number of heads gives us the equation:
   \[
   c + d = 180
   \]

2. Camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump. The total number of humps gives us the equation:
   \[
   2c + d = 304
   \]

Now we have the following system of equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)  (Equation 1)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \) (Equation 2)

We can solve this system step by step.

First, we can solve Equation 1 for \( d \):
\[
d = 180 - c
\]

Next, we substitute \( d \) in Equation 2:
\[
2c + (180 - c) = 304
\]

Now simplify this equation:
\[
2c + 180 - c = 304
\]
\[
c + 180 = 304
\]
\[
c = 304 - 180
\]
\[
c = 124

Now that we have \( c \), we can find \( d \) using Equation 1:
\[
d = 180 - c = 180 - 124 = 56

   - Distance for the first 4 days = \( 200 \, \text{km/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 800 \, \text{km} \).

2. **Distance traveled in the next 2 days:**
   - He traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days over the next 2 days.
   - 30% of 800 km = \( 0.30 \times 800 \, \text{km} = 240 \, \text{km} \).
   - This distance is spread over 2 days, so he traveled \( 240 \, \text{km} \) in total during these 2 days.

3. **Distance traveled on the next day:**
   - On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day = 0 km.

4. **Distance traveled in the second week:**
   - During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days.
   - Distance for the second week = \( 300 \, \text{km/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2100 \, \text{km} \).

5. **Total distance traveled:**
   - Now, we sum up all the distances:

- Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker, which gives us:

We know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, so we can set up the equation:

1. **Cost of the bagel**: 
   - The bagel costs $4.

2. **Cost of the soup**:

   - 25% of the bagel's price: \( 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \).
   - Therefore, the cost of the soup: \( 4 + 1 = 5 \).

1. **Number of guests expected**: 36 guests.
2. **Hotdogs prepared**: The caterer prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs. 
   - Half of 36 guests is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) guests.
   - If these 18 guests each have 2 hotdogs, the total number of hotdogs prepared is \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs.

3. **Number of guests that actually showed up**: 40 guests.
4. **Hotdogs desired**: Since everyone wanted a second hotdog, each of the 40 guests wanted 2 hotdogs.
   - Total hotdogs needed for 40 guests is \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \) hotdogs.

5. **Hotdogs available**: The caterer only prepared 36 hotdogs.

Now, we can find out how many guests did not get a second hotdog:

- Total hotdogs needed: 80
- Total hotdogs available: 36

The number of hotdogs that are short is:
\[ 80 - 36 = 44 \]

Since each guest can only be short of one hotdog at a time, the number of guests who could not get a second hotdog is equal to the number of hotdogs short, which is 44.

However, since there are only 40 guests, it means that all guests would have received their first hotdog, but not all could get their second hotdog. 

Thus, since there are only 36 hotdogs available, and all 40 guests want a second hotdog, we can conclude that:

- All 36 hotdogs will be distributed to the first 36 guests, and the remaining 4 guests will not receive a second hotdog.

3. **Determine the time difference**:
   - Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. 
   - Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, he will arrive at the theater 4 minutes after he leaves.

1. **Super Ticket Option:**
   - Cost of super ticket: $20
   - Cost of popcorn and soda: $1 extra
   - Total cost for super ticket option: \( 20 + 1 = 21 \)

2. **Regular Ticket Option:**
   - Cost of regular movie ticket: $12
   - Cost of soda: $3
   - Let the regular price of popcorn be \( P \).
   - Total cost for regular ticket option: \( 12 + 3 + P = 15 + P \)

According to the problem, if you didn't buy the super ticket, you saved $2. This means:

\[
\text{Cost of super ticket option} - \text{Cost of regular ticket option} = 2

Substituting the total costs we calculated:

\[
21 - (15 + P) = 2
\]

Now, simplify the equation:

gsm8k,gsm8k-473,TrustRoute-NoRep,2,"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that is made up by the combined length of the remoras, we can follow these steps:

1. **Convert the lengths to the same unit**: 
   - The shark's length is 10 feet. 
   - Each remora is 6 inches long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert the remoras' length to feet:
     \[
     6 \text{ inches} = \frac{6}{12} \text{ feet} = 0.5 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Calculate the combined length of the remoras**:
   - There are 2 remoras, so their combined length is:
     \[
     2 \times 0.5 \text{ feet} = 1 \text{ foot}
     \]

3. **Calculate the percentage of the shark's length that the remoras represent**:
   - The formula for percentage is:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{part}}{\text{whole}} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - Here, the part is the combined length of the remoras (1 foot) and the whole is the length of the shark (10 feet):
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100 = 10\%

Let:
- \( A \) be the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( B \) be the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

From the problem, we have:
- \( |A| = 9 \) (kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |B| = 6 \) (kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |A \cap B| = 3 \) (kids allergic to both)

We want to find the total number of kids who are allergic to at least one of these allergens. We can calculate this using the formula for the union of two sets:

\[
|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
|A \cup B| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12
\]

This means there are 12 kids who are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both.

Now, to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids who are allergic from the total number of kids in the class:

\[
\text{Number of kids not allergic} = \text{Total kids} - |A \cup B|

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. \( L + D + B = 43 \) (the total number of insects)
2. \( L = D + 7 \) (Lily found 7 more than David)
3. \( D = \frac{1}{2} B \) (David found half of what Bodhi found)

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( L \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \) into the first equation.

First, from equation 3, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( D \):
\[
B = 2D
\]

Now substitute \( L \) and \( B \) into the total equation:
\[
L + D + B = 43
\]
Substituting \( L = D + 7 \) and \( B = 2D \):
\[
(D + 7) + D + (2D) = 43
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
4D + 7 = 43
\]
Now, subtract 7 from both sides:
\[
4D = 36
\]
Now, divide by 4:
\[
D = 9

Now that we have \( D \), we can find \( L \) and \( B \):
\[
L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

\[
B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18

According to the problem:

1. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs:

   \]
   where \( S_O \) is the number of sofas Ophelia has.

2. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia:
   \[
   C_J = 3C_O
   \]

3. We know that Ophelia has 20 sofas:
   \[
   S_O = 20
   \]

Using the first equation, we can find the number of chairs Ophelia has:
\[
20 = C_O - 2
\]
Adding 2 to both sides:
\[
C_O = 22
\]

Now we can find the number of chairs Jenna has using the second equation:
\[
C_J = 3C_O = 3 \times 22 = 66
\]

Next, we can find the number of sofas Jenna has. Since Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs:
\[
S_J = C_J - 2 = 66 - 2 = 64

- Total chairs:
\[
C_O + C_J = 22 + 66 = 88

   - So, Jame's cousin's age in 8 years will be \( 2 \times 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55 \).

3. **Setting Up the Equation**:
   - In 8 years, Jame's cousin's age will also be \( x + 8 \).

1. **Total Savings Target**: Elvis wants to save $1125 in April.

2. **Days in April**: April has 30 days. Therefore, the first half consists of 15 days, and the second half also consists of 15 days.

3. **Let \( x \)** be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of the month. 

4. **Savings in the First Half**: The total savings for the first half of the month is:
   \[
   \text{Savings in first half} = 15x
   \]

5. **Savings in the Second Half**: According to the problem, he wants to save twice as much each day in the second half. Therefore, he saves \( 2x \) each day in the second half. The total savings for the second half is:
   \[
   \text{Savings in second half} = 15(2x) = 30x
   \]

6. **Total Savings Equation**: The total savings for the month can be expressed as:
   \[
   15x + 30x = 1125
   \]
   Simplifying this gives:
   \[
   45x = 1125
   \]

7. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   \[
   x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25
   \]

8. **Calculating Savings in the Second Half**: Since \( x = 25 \), the amount he saves each day in the second half is:

gsm8k,gsm8k-563,TrustRoute-NoRep,2,"To find out how much James spends on birthday candles, we first need to determine how many candles he needs to buy for his two sons.

1. The older son is 12 years old, so he needs 12 candles.
2. The younger son is 4 years younger than the older son, which makes him 12 - 4 = 8 years old. Therefore, he needs 8 candles.

Now, we add the number of candles needed for both sons:

- Total candles needed = 12 (for the older son) + 8 (for the younger son) = 20 candles.

Next, we need to determine how many packs of candles James needs to buy. Since each pack contains 5 candles, we can calculate the number of packs required:

- Number of packs needed = Total candles needed / Candles per pack = 20 / 5 = 4 packs.

Now, we can calculate the total cost. Each pack costs $3:

- Total cost = Number of packs × Cost per pack = 4 × $3 = $12.

2. **Days of Spending**: Peter plans to spend money from Sunday through Saturday, which is a total of 7 days.

3. **Daily Spending**: To find out how much he can spend each day, we divide his total money by the number of days:
   \[
   \text{Daily Spending} = \frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day}

   \]

6. **Spending from Thursday to Saturday**: For the remaining three days (Thursday to Saturday), Peter spends the remaining amount of money. The total amount he has left after spending on wooden figures is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining Money} = 70 \text{ dollars} - 40 \text{ dollars} = 30 \text{ dollars}

We can express the height of the beanstalk after \( n \) days with the formula:

- \( n = 2: 2^2 = 4 \)

Next, we calculate how many pounds Marissa makes in one hour. According to the problem, Marissa makes \( \frac{3}{4} \) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in the two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, Marissa's hourly production is:

Let:
- \( s \) = number of sheep
- \( g \) = number of geese

From the problem, we know:
1. Each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs. The total number of legs is 70:
   \[
   4s + 2g = 70
   \]

2. Each animal has 1 head. The total number of heads is 20:
   \[
   s + g = 20
   \]

Now we have the following system of equations:
1. \( 4s + 2g = 70 \)
2. \( s + g = 20 \)

We can solve this system step by step.

First, we can simplify the first equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[
2s + g = 35
\]

Now we have:
1. \( 2s + g = 35 \)
2. \( s + g = 20 \)

Next, we can solve the second equation for \( g \):
\[
g = 20 - s
\]

Now we can substitute \( g \) in the first equation:
\[
2s + (20 - s) = 35
\]

Simplifying this gives:
\[
2s + 20 - s = 35
\]
\[
s + 20 = 35
\]
\[
s = 35 - 20
\]
\[
s = 15
\]

Now that we have \( s \), we can find \( g \):
\[
g = 20 - s = 20 - 15 = 5

- Let \( M \) be the number of cookies Max has.
- Let \( C \) be the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of cookies Summer has.

From the problem, we know the following:

1. \( K = M - 5 \) (Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max)
2. \( M = C + 12 \) (Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster)
3. \( S = M + 23 \) (Summer has 23 more cookies than Max)
4. \( K = 68 \) (Katarina has 68 cookies)

Now, we can substitute \( K \) into the first equation:

\[
68 = M - 5
\]

Adding 5 to both sides gives:

\[
M = 68 + 5 = 73
\]

Now that we have \( M \), we can find \( C \):

\[
M = C + 12 \implies 73 = C + 12
\]

Subtracting 12 from both sides gives:

\[
C = 73 - 12 = 61
\]

Next, we can find \( S \):

\[
S = M + 23 \implies S = 73 + 23 = 96
\]

Now we have the number of cookies for each person:

- Katarina (K) = 68
- Max (M) = 73
- Cookie Monster (C) = 61
- Summer (S) = 96

Now, we can calculate the total number of cookies:

\[

   \[
   T = R + 7

   where \( R \) is the age of the triplet that is 7 years younger than the twin.

2. The combined ages of the twins and triplets is 44. Since there are two twins and three triplets, we can express this as:

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation. Substituting \( T \) in terms of \( R \):

Topher's shoe length is 8 feet and 4 inches. We can convert this to inches as follows:

1. Convert feet to inches:
   \[
   8 \text{ feet} = 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. Add the remaining inches:
   \[
   96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches}

So, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches.

Next, we know from the problem statement that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. We can express this relationship mathematically. Let \( b \) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. The equation based on the problem statement is:

\[

Let \( A \) be the number of books Ahmed read in that hour. According to the problem, we have:
\[
E = 2A
\]
where \( E \) is the number of books Ezra read. Since Ezra read 300 books:
\[

1. **Driving Speed and Time:**
   - The average driving speed is 50 miles per hour.
   - The total time for the trip is 6 hours, and they spent 1.5 hours hiking.
   - Therefore, the time spent driving is:
     \[
     \text{Time driving} = \text{Total time} - \text{Time hiking} = 6 \text{ hours} - 1.5 \text{ hours} = 4.5 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Distance Driven:**
   - The distance driven can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
     \]
   - Thus, the distance driven is:
     \[
     \text{Distance driven} = 50 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4.5 \text{ hours} = 225 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Hiking Speed:**
   - The hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half the driving speed.
   - Half of the driving speed is:
     \[
     \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ miles/hour}

   - Therefore, the hiking speed is:
     \[
     \text{Hiking speed} = 25 \text{ miles/hour} - 5 \text{ miles/hour} = 20 \text{ miles/hour}

4. **Distance Hiked:**
   - The distance hiked can also be calculated using the distance formula:

According to the problem:

- Ava jumps on \( e + 8 \) enemies.
- Ava collects \( b + 3 \) berries.
- Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so if Emma has \( t \) seconds left, Ava has \( t - 4 \) seconds left.

Now we can calculate the scores for both Ava and Emma.

**Emma's score:**
- Points from enemies: \( 10e \)
- Points from berries: \( 5b \)
- Points from time: \( 30t \)

So, Emma's total score \( S_E \) is:
\[
S_E = 10e + 5b + 30t
\]

**Ava's score:**
- Points from enemies: \( 10(e + 8) = 10e + 80 \)
- Points from berries: \( 5(b + 3) = 5b + 15 \)
- Points from time: \( 30(t - 4) = 30t - 120 \)

So, Ava's total score \( S_A \) is:
\[
S_A = (10e + 80) + (5b + 15) + (30t - 120)
\]
\[
S_A = 10e + 5b + 30t + 80 + 15 - 120
\]
\[
S_A = 10e + 5b + 30t - 25

Now, we can find the difference between their scores:
\[
S_A - S_E = (10e + 5b + 30t - 25) - (10e + 5b + 30t)
\]
\[
S_A - S_E = -25

Initially, Bob had:
- 3 orange fish
- 4 white fish

After buying more fish, the total number of orange fish becomes \( 3 + x \) and the total number of white fish becomes \( 4 + y \).

According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob found that he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[
3 + x = 2(4 + y)
\]

We also know that Bob bought a total of 17 fish, which gives us another equation:

\[
x + y = 17
\]

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. \( 3 + x = 2(4 + y) \)
2. \( x + y = 17 \)

Let's solve the first equation:

\[
3 + x = 8 + 2y
\]
\[
x - 2y = 5 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]

Now, we can use the second equation:

\[
x + y = 17 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\]

From Equation 2, we can express \( x \) in terms of \( y \):

\[
x = 17 - y
\]

Now, substitute \( x \) in Equation 1:

\[
(17 - y) - 2y = 5
\]
\[
17 - 3y = 5
\]
\[
-3y = 5 - 17

\[
-3y = -12

\[
y = 4

Now that we have \( y \), we can find \( x \):

\[
x = 17 - y = 17 - 4 = 13

   \[
   \text{Total chips} = 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips}
   \]

2. **Determine how many square inches of the mosaic can be made with the total chips:**
   - It takes 12 chips to cover 1 square inch.
   \[
   \text{Square inches} = \frac{\text{Total chips}}{\text{Chips per square inch}} = \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the area of the mosaic:**
   - The mosaic is 3 inches tall, so we can use the area formula (Area = Length × Height) to find the length.
   \[
   \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Height}
   \]
   - We know the area is 12 square inches and the height is 3 inches.
   \[
   12 \text{ square inches} = \text{Length} \times 3 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Solve for the length:**
   \[
   \text{Length} = \frac{12 \text{ square inches}}{3 \text{ inches}} = 4 \text{ inches}
   \]

Thus, Milo can make his mosaic **4 inches long**.",0.00146725,11.312429904937744,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,

Here's the breakdown:

1. Initial order: 100 candies
2. Candies sold: 150 candies
3. Additional order: 100 candies

To find out how many more candies Dale needs to sell to fulfill all orders, we can calculate:

- Total candies needed to fulfill orders = 150 (candies sold)
- Total candies available = 100 (initial order) + 100 (additional order) = 200 candies

Now, we can determine how many more candies Dale needs to sell:

- Total candies needed to sell = 150
- Total candies available = 200

Since Dale has enough candies to cover the 150 sold, he does not need to sell any more candies. In fact, he has 200 - 150 = 50 candies left after fulfilling the orders.

Thus, Dale does not need to sell any more candies to fulfill his current orders. He has already sold enough and has extra candies remaining.",0.0032203500000000003,12.958291292190552,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_confidence,

Felix charges $0.25 per branch. If he made $105 in total, we can calculate the total number of branches he climbed by dividing his total earnings by the cost per branch:

\[
\text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25}

- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest (in ounces).
- Since she uses the same amount of fragrance as citrus zest, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \).
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt (in ounces).
- Since she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \).
- Let \( o \) be the amount of oil (in ounces).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. \( o = 2s \) (twice as much oil as salt)
2. \( s = 2z \) (twice as much salt as zest)

Now, we can express everything in terms of \( z \):

From \( s = 2z \), we can substitute \( s \) into the equation for oil:
\[
o = 2s = 2(2z) = 4z
\]

Now we can express the total amount of the scrub in terms of \( z \):
\[

We know that the total amount of the scrub is 10 ounces:

- Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so we can express Becca's cards as \( b = s + 12 = 3p + 12 \).

The total number of cards is given as 341, so we can set up the equation:

\[
p + s + b = 341
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( s \) and \( b \) into the equation:

\[
p + 3p + (3p + 12) = 341
\]

Now, combine like terms:

\[
p + 3p + 3p + 12 = 341

2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the first equation.

First, from the third equation, we can express \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
\[
A = F - 12
\]

Now, substitute \( A \) into the second equation to find \( S \):
\[
S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13

Now we have expressions for \( S \) and \( A \):
- \( S = F + 13 \)
- \( A = F - 12 \)

Substituting these into the first equation:

1. **Cost of bacon**:
   - Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total.

2. **Cost of chicken**:
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. Since the total cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10, the cost of one pack of bacon is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of one pack of bacon} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Therefore, the cost of one packet of chicken is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of one packet of chicken} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost for chicken is:

3. **Cost of strawberries**:
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, each priced at $4. Thus, the total cost for strawberries is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of strawberries} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Cost of apples**:
   - Each pack of apples is priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries. Since a pack of strawberries costs $4, the cost of one pack of apples is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of one pack of apples} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost for apples is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of apples} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Total cost of all items**:

According to the problem:

1. Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.
2. The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.

Now, we need to calculate how much Tasha made from mowing lawns.

Joe paid Tasha $6 for mowing his lawn, so from Joe, she made:
\[
\text{Income from Joe} = 6
\]

From Kamala, since she mowed her lawn \( 3x \) times, we need to know how much she charged per mow. However, we don't have that information directly. Let's assume she charged \( y \) dollars per mow. Then, her income from Kamala would be:
\[
\text{Income from Kamala} = 3x \cdot y
\]

From Alba, since she mowed her lawn \( 5x \) times, her income from Alba would be:
\[
\text{Income from Alba} = 5x \cdot y
\]

Now, we can express her total income from mowing lawns as:
\[
\text{Total income from mowing} = 6 + 3x \cdot y + 5x \cdot y
\]
\[
= 6 + (3x + 5x) \cdot y
\]
\[
= 6 + 8x \cdot y
\]

We know that Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[
6 + 8x \cdot y + \text{Income from lemonade} = 80
\]

Let \( L \) be the income from lemonade sales. Thus, we have:
\[
L + 6 + 8x \cdot y = 80
\]
\[
L + 8x \cdot y = 74
\]

To find \( L \), we need to determine \( 8x \cdot y \). However, we don't have enough information to find the exact values of \( x \) and \( y \). 

Since we need to find how much she made from lemonade sales, we can express it as:
\[
L = 74 - 8x \cdot y
\]

Without specific values for \( x \) and \( y \), we cannot determine the exact amount Tasha made from lemonade sales. However, we know that her income from lemonade sales is dependent on the values of \( x \) and \( y \).

If we assume that Tasha only mowed Joe's lawn once (i.e., \( x = 1 \)), then:
\[
\text{Income from Joe} = 6
\]
\[
\text{Income from Kamala} = 3 \cdot 1 \cdot y = 3y
\]
\[
\text{Income from Alba} = 5 \cdot 1 \cdot y = 5y
\]
\[
L + 6 + 3y + 5y = 80
\]
\[
L + 6 + 8y = 80
\]
\[
L + 8y = 74
\]
\[
L = 74 - 8y
\]

If we assume \( y = 1 \) (Tasha charged $1 per mow), then:
\[
L = 74 - 8 \cdot 1 = 66
\]

Thus, if Tasha charged $1 per mow and mowed Joe's lawn once, she made $66 from lemonade sales.

However, without specific values for \( x \) and \( y \), we cannot definitively conclude the exact amount Tasha made from lemonade sales. The answer can vary based on the assumptions made about \( x \) and \( y \).",0.00802695,27.4803946018219,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_confidence,

\[
\text{Amount of water in the tank} = \frac{10000 \text{ gallons}}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons}
\]

Next, we know that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. Over 6 days, the total amount of water used from the tank can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total water used in 6 days} = 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons}
\]

Now, we can find out how much water remains in the tank after 6 days by subtracting the total water used from the initial amount in the tank:

\[
\text{Remaining water in the tank} = 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons}

1) If the intended trio is Peter, Paul and John (i.e. the total 100 refers to Peter+Paul+John):

Let John's age = x.
Paul = x + 10.
Peter = Paul + John = (x+10) + x = 2x + 10.

1. **Deanna's Age**: We know that Deanna is 26 years old.

2. **Marcus's Age**: The problem states that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna. Therefore, we can calculate Marcus's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Marcus's Age} = \text{Deanna's Age} - 5 = 26 - 5 = 21

1. The total points scored by all three is 45:
   \[
   B + A + D = 45
   \]

2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo:
   \[
   B = A + 20
   \]

3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar:
   \[
   B = D + 10
   \]

Now we can substitute the expressions for \( B \) from the second and third equations into the first equation.

From \( B = A + 20 \), we can express \( A \) in terms of \( B \):
\[
A = B - 20
\]

From \( B = D + 10 \), we can express \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
\[
D = B - 10
\]

Now we substitute \( A \) and \( D \) into the total points equation:
\[
B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45
\]

Simplifying this equation:
\[
B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45
\]
\[
3B - 30 = 45
\]

Now, add 30 to both sides:
\[
3B = 75
\]

Now, divide by 3:
\[
B = 25
\]

Now that we have \( B \), we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
\[
A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5
\]
\[
D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15

Thus, the points scored by each are:
- Bahati: 25 points

From the problem, we have the following equations:

1. The total number of Pokemon caught:
   \[
   A + S + D = 339
   \]

2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan:
   \[
   A = S + 5
   \]

3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times what Adelwolfe has caught:
   \[
   S = 4D - 13
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( S \) into the first equation.

Substituting \( A \) from equation 2 into equation 1:
\[
(S + 5) + S + D = 339
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2S + D + 5 = 339
\]
Subtracting 5 from both sides gives:
\[
2S + D = 334 \quad \text{(Equation 4)}
\]

Next, we substitute \( S \) from equation 3 into equation 4. From equation 3, we have:
\[
D = \frac{S + 13}{4}
\]
Now substituting this into equation 4:
\[
2S + \frac{S + 13}{4} = 334
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 4:
\[
4(2S) + (S + 13) = 4 \times 334
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
8S + S + 13 = 1336
\]
Combining like terms gives:
\[
9S + 13 = 1336
\]
Subtracting 13 from both sides:
\[
9S = 1323
\]
Dividing by 9:
\[
S = 147
\]

Now we have found that Stan has caught \( S = 147 \) Pokemon.

To verify, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
1. From \( A = S + 5 \):
   \[
   A = 147 + 5 = 152
   \]

2. From \( S = 4D - 13 \):
   \[
   147 = 4D - 13
   \]
   Adding 13 to both sides:
   \[
   160 = 4D
   \]
   Dividing by 4:
   \[
   D = 40
   \]

Now we check the total:
\[
A + S + D = 152 + 147 + 40 = 339

This confirms our calculations are correct.

x - \frac{3}{4}x = \frac{1}{4}x
\]

These remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. Thus, the number of flights to France is:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{4}x \right) = \frac{1}{8}x
\]

Now, we know that the second plane makes 44 trips, and this number is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
44 = \frac{1}{2}x
\]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides by 2:

\[
x = 88
\]

Now that we have the total number of flights for the first plane, we can calculate the number of flights to France:

\[
\text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{8}x = \frac{1}{8} \times 88 = 11
\]

Thus, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is:

\[
\boxed{11}

gsm8k,gsm8k-994,TrustRoute-NoRep,2,"Let's break down the howling times for each wolf step by step.

1. **Tobias's Howl**: 
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's Howl**: 
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias. 
   - Therefore, Chikote howls for \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) seconds.

3. **Igneous's Howl**: 
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - The combined time of Tobias and Chikote's howls is \( 20 + 40 = 60 \) seconds.
   - Thus, Igneous howls for 60 seconds.

Now, we can find the total time of all three wolves' howls:

\[
\text{Total howl time} = \text{Tobias's howl} + \text{Chikote's howl} + \text{Igneous's howl}

- Akbar's age: \( A = 3 \)
- Alessandro's age: \( Al = 4 \)
- Helene's age: \( H \)
- Wilfred's age: \( W \)

We know the total age of the children is 20:
\[
A + Al + H + W = 20
\]
Substituting the known ages:
\[
3 + 4 + H + W = 20
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
H + W = 20 - 7 = 13
\]
So, we have:
\[
H + W = 13 \quad \text{(1)}
\]

Next, we know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is given by:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{A + Al + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
\]
Thus, Helene's age can be expressed as:
\[
H = 2 \times \text{Average age} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Now we can substitute \( H = 10 \) back into equation (1):
\[

\[
W = 13 - 10 = 3

Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since there are 4 kids, the total size of the slices for the kids is:

\[
4x
\]

Each adult gets a slice that is twice the size of a kid's slice, which means each adult gets:

\[
2x
\]

Since there are 2 adults, the total size of the slices for the adults is:

\[
2 \times 2x = 4x
\]

Now, we can find the total size of the watermelon by adding the total sizes of the slices for both adults and kids:

\[
\text{Total size} = \text{Total size for kids} + \text{Total size for adults} = 4x + 4x = 8x
\]

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets. Each adult receives a slice of size \( 2x \). The percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is calculated as follows:

\[

1. **Calculate the total number of packs Anne has**: 
   Anne purchased a box that contains 15 packs.

2. **Calculate the total number of pieces in the box**: 
   Each pack has 60 pieces, so the total number of pieces is:
   \[
   15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 900 \text{ pieces}

gsm8k,gsm8k-1016,TrustRoute-NoRep,2,"To calculate the price of carrots after three years with a 5% annual increase, we can use the formula for compound interest:

\[
P = P_0 (1 + r)^n
\]

Where:
- \( P \) is the future price,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price,
- \( r \) is the rate of increase (as a decimal),
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) (initial price),
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% increase),
- \( n = 3 \) (number of years).

Now we can substitute the values into the formula:

\[
P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3
\]

Calculating \( (1 + 0.05)^3 \):

\[
(1.05)^3 = 1.157625

Now, calculate the future price:

\[
P = 120 \times 1.157625 \approx 138.915

1. **Total Pictures**: Olivia uploaded a total of 72 pictures.
2. **Number of Albums**: She created 8 albums.

To find out how many pictures are in each album, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums:

\[
\text{Pictures per album} = \frac{72 \text{ pictures}}{8 \text{ albums}} = 9 \text{ pictures per album}
\]

Now we know that each album contains 9 pictures.

3. **Selfies and Portraits**: 
   - 3 albums are selfies only.
   - 2 albums are portraits.

Now, we can calculate the total number of selfies and portraits:

- **Total selfies**: 
  \[
  \text{Total selfies} = 3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 27 \text{ selfies}
  \]

- **Total portraits**: 
  \[

According to the problem, Teresa sells small stuffed animals for $4 each, and large stuffed animals are sold for three times that price, which means each large stuffed animal costs \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

Now, we can set up the equation for the total earnings from the sales:

\[
\text{Total Earnings} = (\text{Number of Small Animals} \times \text{Price of Small Animal}) + (\text{Number of Large Animals} \times \text{Price of Large Animal})

1. **Probability of having a substitute teacher (who won't collect homework)**: 50%
   - This means there is a 50% chance that he does not have to turn in his homework.

2. **Probability of having the normal teacher (who might give an extension)**: 50%
   - If the normal teacher is present, there is a 40% chance she will give an extension, meaning there is a 60% chance that she will not give an extension.

3. **If the normal teacher does not give an extension**: 
   - There is a 20% chance that Marcus can convince her that his dog ate his homework, which means there is an 80% chance that he will still have to turn in his homework.

Now, let's calculate the overall probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:

- **Case 1**: Substitute teacher (50% chance) → No homework (0% chance of having to turn it in)
  
- **Case 2**: Normal teacher (50% chance)
  - **Sub-case 2a**: Extension given (40% chance) → No homework (0% chance of having to turn it in)
  - **Sub-case 2b**: No extension given (60% chance)
    - **Sub-sub-case 2b1**: Marcus convinces the teacher (20% chance) → No homework (0% chance of having to turn it in)
    - **Sub-sub-case 2b2**: Marcus does not convince the teacher (80% chance) → He has to turn in homework (100% chance of having to turn it in)

Now we can calculate the probabilities for the cases where he has to turn in his homework:

- Probability of having to turn in homework if the normal teacher is present:
  - Probability of no extension and not convincing the teacher:
    \[
    P(\text{No extension}) \times P(\text{Not convincing}) = 0.60 \times 0.80 = 0.48

gsm8k,gsm8k-1038,TrustRoute-NoRep,2,"To determine how long it would take Jim to earn back the money equivalent to the loans and the income lost while he was in college, we can break the problem down into several steps.

1. **Calculate Total Loans**:
   Jim takes out $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years.
   \[
   \text{Total Loans} = 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000
   \]

2. **Calculate Income Lost While in College**:
   Before college, Jim earns $25,000 per year. For 4 years, the income lost is:
   \[
   \text{Income Lost} = 25,000 \times 4 = 100,000
   \]

3. **Total Financial Burden**:
   The total financial burden Jim has after college is the sum of the loans and the income lost:
   \[
   \text{Total Financial Burden} = \text{Total Loans} + \text{Income Lost} = 200,000 + 100,000 = 300,000

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took \( 2 \times (x + 80) \).

Now, we can express the total amount taken by all three people:

\[
x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920
\]

Now, let's simplify the left side of the equation:

\[
x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 4x + 240
\]

So we have:

\[
4x + 240 = 1920
\]

Next, we will isolate \( x \):

1. Subtract 240 from both sides:

\[
4x = 1920 - 240
\]
\[
4x = 1680
\]

2. Divide both sides by 4:

\[
x = \frac{1680}{4} = 420
\]

Thus, the share of the first person is \( \boxed{420} \).

To verify:
- The first person took \( 420 \).
- The second person took \( 420 + 80 = 500 \).
- The third person took \( 2 \times 500 = 1000 \).

- \( P_0 \) is the initial price of the car,
- \( r \) is the depreciation rate (as a decimal),
- \( t \) is the number of years since the purchase.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 20000 \) (the initial price of the car),
- \( r = 0.21 \) (the depreciation rate of 21%),
- \( t = 2010 - 2007 = 3 \) (the number of years from 2007 to 2010).

The total time for the meal is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
x + (x + 18) = 98
\]

Now, let's simplify and solve for \( x \):

1. **Calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought:**
   - She bought 10 bunches, and each bunch has an average of 4 bananas.
   - Total bananas = 10 bunches × 4 bananas/bunch = 40 bananas.

2. **Calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually:**
   - The cost of each banana is $0.80.
   - Total cost if bought individually = 40 bananas × $0.80/banana = $32.00.

3. **Calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches:**
   - The cost of each bunch is $3.00.
   - Total cost for 10 bunches = 10 bunches × $3.00/bunch = $30.00.

4. **Calculate the savings:**

gsm8k,gsm8k-1084,TrustRoute-NoRep,2,"Let's denote the amount of fence that Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so we can express the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H = S + 60 \) feet.

Since the total amount of fence is 100 feet, we can set up the following equation:

\[
S + H = 100
\]

Substituting the expression for \( H \) into the equation gives us:

\[
S + (S + 60) = 100
\]

Simplifying this, we have:

\[
2S + 60 = 100
\]

Next, we subtract 60 from both sides:

\[
2S = 100 - 60
\]
\[
2S = 40
\]

Now, we divide both sides by 2 to find \( S \):

\[
S = 20
\]

Now that we know Sam gets 20 feet of fence, we can find out how much Harry gets:

\[
H = S + 60 = 20 + 60 = 80
\]

Thus, Sam has 20 feet of fence, and Harry has 80 feet. There is no leftover fence since they are using the entire 100 feet.

gsm8k,gsm8k-1086,TrustRoute-NoRep,2,"To calculate how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles, we need to determine the number of each type of bike sold and then calculate the total earnings based on their prices.

1. **Determine the number of each type of bike sold:**
   - Total bikes sold: 300
   - Half of them were Trekking bikes: 
     \[
     \text{Trekking bikes} = \frac{300}{2} = 150
     \]
   - 15% were BMX bikes:
     \[
     \text{BMX bikes} = 0.15 \times 300 = 45
     \]
   - The rest were MTB bikes. To find the number of MTB bikes sold, we subtract the number of Trekking and BMX bikes from the total:
     \[
     \text{MTB bikes} = 300 - 150 - 45 = 105
     \]

2. **Calculate the earnings from each type of bike:**
   - Price of one MTB: $500
   - Price of one BMX: 
     \[
     \text{BMX price} = \frac{500}{2} = 250
     \]
   - Price of one Trekking bike: $450

   Now we can calculate the total earnings from each type:
   - Earnings from MTB bikes:
     \[
     \text{Earnings from MTB} = 105 \times 500 = 52500
     \]
   - Earnings from BMX bikes:

     \]
   - Earnings from Trekking bikes:
     \[
     \text{Earnings from Trekking} = 150 \times 450 = 67500

gsm8k,gsm8k-1088,TrustRoute-NoRep,2,"To calculate the total hours John spends learning in a week, we can break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the total minutes spent in regular classes per week:**
   - John has 6 periods each day for 5 days.
   - Each period is assumed to be 40 minutes long.
   - Total minutes in regular classes = 6 periods/day * 40 minutes/period * 5 days/week.

   \[
   \text{Total minutes in regular classes} = 6 \times 40 \times 5 = 1200 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total minutes spent in extra classes per week:**
   - John takes 2 extra classes each day for 5 days.
   - Each extra class is also 40 minutes long.
   - Total minutes in extra classes = 2 extra classes/day * 40 minutes/class * 5 days/week.

   \[
   \text{Total minutes in extra classes} = 2 \times 40 \times 5 = 400 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total minutes spent in learning during the week:**
   - Total learning time = Total minutes in regular classes + Total minutes in extra classes.

   \[
   \text{Total learning time} = 1200 + 400 = 1600 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Calculate the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - Total weekly minutes = 7 days * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 10080 minutes.
   - Extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday = \( \frac{1}{16} \) of total weekly minutes.

   \[
   \text{Extra learning time} = \frac{1}{16} \times 10080 = 630 \text{ minutes}
   \]

   Since this extra time is spent equally on Saturday and Sunday, each day he spends:

   \[
   \text{Extra learning time per day} = \frac{630}{2} = 315 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total learning time including the extra learning time:**
   - Total learning time for the week = Total learning time + Extra learning time.

   \[
   \text{Total learning time for the week} = 1600 + 630 = 2230 \text{ minutes}
   \]

6. **Convert total learning time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.

According to the problem:
- A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{x}{5} \).
- A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{x}{5} = \frac{x}{15} \).

We know that when the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

We know the following:

- Distance walked on the beach: 2 miles
- Distance walked on the sidewalk: 1 mile
- Time spent on the beach: 40 minutes

First, we need to convert the time spent on the beach from minutes to hours, since speed is in miles per hour. 

\[
40 \text{ minutes} = \frac{40}{60} \text{ hours} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ hours}
\]

Now, we can calculate Grandma's speed on the beach using the formula:

\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}
\]

For the beach:

\[
v = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{\frac{2}{3} \text{ hours}} = 2 \times \frac{3}{2} = 3 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Now that we have Grandma's speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk:

\[
\text{Speed on sidewalk} = 2v = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes her to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk. Using the same formula for speed:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

For the sidewalk:

\[
\text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{6 \text{ miles per hour}} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ hours}
\]

Now we convert this time into minutes:

\[
\frac{1}{6} \text{ hours} = \frac{1}{6} \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 10 \text{ minutes}
\]

Finally, we can find the total time for the entire 3-mile walk by adding the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time on beach} + \text{Time on sidewalk} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}

Thus, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete her entire 3-mile walk is:

Let \( T \) be the temperature of the second mug of water. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the total volume of water in the bottle is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) ounces.

The total heat content of the water in the bottle can be calculated as follows:

- The heat content from the 33-degree mug:
\[ 4 \text{ ounces} \times 33 \text{ degrees} = 132 \text{ degree-ounces} \]

- The heat content from the second mug:
\[ 1 \text{ ounce} \times T \text{ degrees} = T \text{ degree-ounces} \]

The total heat content of the mixture is:
\[ 132 + T \text{ degree-ounces} \]

The average temperature of the mixture can be calculated by dividing the total heat content by the total volume:
\[
\text{Average temperature} = \frac{132 + T}{5}
\]

For Donny to be able to drink the water, this average temperature must be at least 40 degrees:
\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( r \) and \( b \) into the combined length equation.

Substituting \( r = 4b \) into the combined length equation:

This simplifies to:

Next, we can substitute \( b = y - 7 \) into the equation \( 5b + y = 37 \):

2. **Chalk Used on Monday**: 45% of 5 inches

   \[
   \text{Chalk Used} = 0.45 \times 5 = 2.25 \text{ inches}

   \[
   \text{Chalk to Use Until Recycling} = 2.75 - 2 = 0.75 \text{ inches}

gsm8k,gsm8k-1181,TrustRoute-NoRep,2,"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now:
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7)
   \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now:
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
   \]

Now we have a system of two equations. Let's solve these equations step by step.

### Step 1: Expand the first equation
From the first equation:
\[
W = 5(C + 7) \implies W = 5C + 35
\]

### Step 2: Substitute \( W \) in the second equation
Now substitute \( W \) in the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35)
\]

### Step 3: Clear the fraction
Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5C + 35
\]
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

### Step 4: Rearrange the equation
Now, rearranging gives:
\[
75 - 35 = 5C - 3C
\]
\[
40 = 2C
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( C \)
Dividing both sides by 2:
\[
C = 20
\]

### Conclusion
Colin is currently \( \boxed{20} \) years old.

### Verification
To verify, we can find Wendy's age:
1. Calculate \( W \):
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7) = 5(20 + 7) = 5 \times 27 = 135
   \]

2. Check the second condition:
   \[
   C + 25 = 20 + 25 = 45
   \]

   - Number of people = 50

2. **Day 2**: 
   - Number of people = Day 1 + 20 = 50 + 20 = 70

3. **Day 3**: 
   - Number of people = 2 × Day 2 = 2 × 70 = 140

Now, we can calculate the total number of people Conor saw during the first three days:

\[
\text{Total for first three days} = 50 + 70 + 140 = 260
\]

Next, we need to calculate the number of people Conor saw for the remaining days of the week. There are 7 days in a week, and he has already accounted for 3 days, so there are:

\[
7 - 3 = 4 \text{ days remaining}
\]

Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for these 4 days:

\[
\text{Total for remaining 4 days} = 60 \times 4 = 240
\]

Finally, we add the totals from the first three days and the remaining four days:

\[
\text{Total number of people for the week} = 260 + 240 = 500
\]

Thus, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is:

gsm8k,gsm8k-1264,TrustRoute-NoRep,2,"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat.

1. **First 30 seconds**: 
   - Number of kernels that popped = 20

2. **Next 30 seconds**: 
   - Number of kernels that popped = 3 times the first amount = \(3 \times 20 = 60\)

3. **Next 30 seconds**: 
   - Popping rate increases to four times the initial rate (which was 20).
   - Number of kernels that popped = \(4 \times 20 = 80\)

4. **Final 30 seconds**: 
   - Popping slows down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds (which was 80).
   - Number of kernels that popped = \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\)

Now, let's sum up the total number of kernels that popped during the cooking time:

\[
\text{Total popped during cooking} = 20 + 60 + 80 + 40
\]

Calculating this:

\[
20 + 60 = 80
\]
\[
80 + 80 = 160
\]
\[
160 + 40 = 200
\]

So, the total number of kernels that popped during cooking is **200**.

5. **Residual popping**: 
   - After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop.
   - Number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds = 40
   - Therefore, the number of kernels that pop from residual heat = \(\frac{40}{4} = 10\)

6. **Total popcorn**: 
   - Now, we add the kernels that popped during cooking and those that popped from residual heat:

\[
\text{Total popcorn} = 200 + 10 = 210
\]

Thus, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is **210**.",0.00331355,15.15632438659668,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,

1. **Calculate the total amount of lemonade Tim needs**: 
   - Tim wants to make 4 gallons of lemonade for the party.
   - Allen wants an extra gallon, which is twice as tart.
   - Therefore, the total amount of lemonade Tim needs is \(4 + 1 = 5\) gallons.

2. **Calculate the amount of lemon juice needed**:
   - The recipe calls for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice per gallon.
   - For 5 gallons, Tim will need \(5 \text{ cups of lemon juice}\).

3. **Determine how many lemons are needed for the extra tart gallon**:
   - The extra gallon for Allen is twice as tart, which means it will require twice the amount of lemon juice.
   - Therefore, for the extra gallon, Tim will need \(2 \text{ cups of lemon juice}\).

4. **Calculate the total amount of lemon juice needed**:
   - For the 4 gallons, Tim needs 4 cups of lemon juice.
   - For the extra gallon, he needs 2 cups of lemon juice.
   - Thus, the total amount of lemon juice required is \(4 + 2 = 6 \text{ cups of lemon juice}\).

5. **Calculate the number of lemons needed**:

   - Therefore, for 6 cups of lemon juice, the number of lemons needed is:
     \[
     6 \text{ lemons/cup} \times 6 \text{ cups} = 36 \text{ lemons}

   - Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, his speed is \( 2v \).

2. **Distance run**:
   - We know that Vanessa ran 4 miles.
   - We need to find out how far Aaron ran. Since Vanessa can run twice as far as Aaron, if we let \( d \) be the distance Aaron ran, then:
     \[
     d = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Time taken by Aaron**:
   - We know Aaron completed his part of the race (2 miles) in 16 minutes. We can use this to find his speed:
     \[
     \text{Speed of Aaron} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{8} \text{ miles per minute}
     \]
   - Since Aaron's speed is \( 2v \), we can set up the equation:
     \[
     2v = \frac{1}{8}
     \]
   - Solving for \( v \):
     \[
     v = \frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute}
     \]

4. **Time taken by Vanessa**:
   - Now we can find the time it took Vanessa to run 4 miles using her speed:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{v} = \frac{4}{\frac{1}{16}} = 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, Vanessa took **64 minutes** to complete her part of the race.",0.0053231500000000005,16.81438946723938,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,
gsm8k,gsm8k-1311,TrustRoute-NoRep,2,"To determine how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of line needed**: The caretaker needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. Since there are 200 feet of dock, the total amount of line needed is:
   \[
   \text{Total line needed} = 3 \, \text{feet of line/foot of dock} \times 200 \, \text{feet of dock} = 600 \, \text{feet of line}
   \]

2. **Determine how much line he already has**: The caretaker currently has 6 feet of new line.

3. **Calculate how much more line he needs to buy**: To find out how much additional line he needs to buy, subtract the amount of line he already has from the total line needed:
   \[
   \text{Line to buy} = \text{Total line needed} - \text{Line he has} = 600 \, \text{feet} - 6 \, \text{feet} = 594 \, \text{feet}

gsm8k,gsm8k-1313,TrustRoute-NoRep,2,"To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the watermelons**: The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80.

2. **Calculate the profit**: The vendor sold the watermelons at a profit of 25%. To find the selling price, we first need to calculate the total selling price based on the cost and the profit percentage.

   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Cost} \times \text{Profit Percentage}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 80 \times 0.25 = 20

gsm8k,gsm8k-1317,TrustRoute-NoRep,2,"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( W \).

We have two equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of animals:
   \[
   C + W = 20
   \]

2. The total number of legs:
   Chickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each, so:
   \[
   2C + 4W = 70
   \]

Now we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[
C + 2W = 35
\]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( C + W = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2W = 35 \)

Next, we can solve for \( C \) and \( W \). We can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(C + 2W) - (C + W) = 35 - 20
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
W = 15
\]

Now that we have \( W \), we can substitute it back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[
C + 15 = 20
\]
\[
C = 20 - 15 = 5
\]

Thus, the number of chickens is \( \boxed{5} \).",0.0029905500000000002,10.206331729888916,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,
