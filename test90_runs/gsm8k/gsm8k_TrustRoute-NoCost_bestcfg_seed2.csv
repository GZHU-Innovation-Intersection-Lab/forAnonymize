gsm8k,gsm8k-211,TrustRoute-NoCost,2,"Let \( r \) be the number of red chickens and \( w \) be the number of white chickens. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The number of white chickens is two more than the number of red chickens:
   \[
   w = r + 2
   \]

2. The total number of eggs produced by the chickens is 42 eggs per day. The red chickens produce 3 eggs each, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs each:
   \[
   3r + 5w = 42
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( w \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[
3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
\]

Expanding this equation gives:

\[
3r + 5r + 10 = 42
\]

Combining like terms:

\[
8r + 10 = 42
\]

Next, we subtract 10 from both sides:

\[
8r = 32
\]

Now, we divide both sides by 8:

\[
r = 4
\]

Now that we have the number of red chickens, we can find the number of white chickens using the first equation:

\[
w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6
\]

Thus, Jerry has:

- \( r = 4 \) red chickens
- \( w = 6 \) white chickens

To verify, we can check the total number of eggs produced:

- Red chickens produce: \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) eggs
- White chickens produce: \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \) eggs

Total eggs produced:

\[
12 + 30 = 42

   - Remaining fries for Griffin: \( 24 - 5 = 19 \) fries.
3. **Fries taken by Billy**: Billy took twice as many as Kyle.
   - Since Kyle took 5 fries, Billy took \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) fries.
   - Remaining fries for Griffin: \( 19 - 10 = 9 \) fries.
4. **Fries taken by Colby**: Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken.
   - Since Kyle took 5 fries, Colby took \( 5 - 3 = 2 \) fries.
   - Remaining fries for Griffin: \( 9 - 2 = 7 \) fries.
5. **Final number of fries Griffin had**: 27 fries.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin.
   - After receiving fries from Ginger, Griffin had \( 7 + x = 27 \).

We are given that Andrea has 52 apples:
\[

Using the first equation, we can find the number of apples Jamal has:
\[
52 = A_J + 8
\]
Subtracting 8 from both sides:
\[

Now, we can find the number of bananas Jamal has using the third equation:
\[
B_J = A_J + 4 = 44 + 4 = 48

Next, we can find the number of bananas Andrea has using the second equation:
\[
B_A = \frac{1}{2} B_J = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24

   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms for one house is:
     \[
     3 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows}
     \]
   - Since there are 2 houses, the total number of bedroom windows in both houses is:

   \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
   \[
   R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Now, let's substitute the first equation into the second equation:

Substituting \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
\]

Now, simplify the right side:

The total number of members in the team is given as 105. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
d + 2d + \frac{d}{2} = 105
\]

Now, let's combine the terms on the left side:

\[
3d + \frac{d}{2} = 105
\]

To combine \( 3d \) and \( \frac{d}{2} \), we can convert \( 3d \) into a fraction with a denominator of 2:

\[
3d = \frac{6d}{2}
\]

Now we can rewrite the equation:

\[
\frac{6d}{2} + \frac{d}{2} = 105
\]

Combining the fractions gives:

\[
\frac{6d + d}{2} = 105
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{7d}{2} = 105
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 2:

\[
7d = 210
\]

Now, divide both sides by 7:

\[
d = 30
\]

Thus, the number of players on the defense is \( \boxed{30} \). 

To verify, we can calculate the number of players on offense and special teams:

- Offense: \( 2d = 2 \times 30 = 60 \)
- Special teams: \( \frac{d}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \)

Now, adding these together:

\[
30 + 60 + 15 = 105
\]

The total is correct, confirming that the number of players on the defense is indeed \( \boxed{30} \).",0.0027368500000000003,15.069112300872803,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,

Let \( x \) be the number of pencils in each box. Then, we can express the total number of pencils Jam has as:

\[
3x + 2 = 26
\]

To find \( x \), we can solve the equation:

1. Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[
3x = 26 - 2
\]
\[
3x = 24
\]

2. Divide both sides by 3:

\[
x = \frac{24}{3} = 8
\]

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Therefore, Jam has:

- 3 boxes of 8 pencils = \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \) pencils
- 2 loose pencils = 2 pencils

Total for Jam = \( 24 + 2 = 26 \) pencils (which confirms our calculation).

The total number of students in all three groups can be expressed as:

\[

\]

Simplifying this equation:

\[
2x + (x - 10) = 200
\]
\[

Next, we add 10 to both sides:

Now, we divide by 3:

\[
x = 70

Now that we have \( x \), we can find the number of students in the smallest group:

According to the problem, we have the following two equations:

1. The total number of animals:
   \[
   c + h = 60
   \]

2. The relationship between chickens and cows:
   \[
   h = 2c
   \]

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:

\[
c + 2c = 60
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
3c = 60
\]

Now, we can solve for \( c \):

\[
c = \frac{60}{3} = 20
\]

Now that we have the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:

\[
h = 2c = 2 \times 20 = 40
\]

So, Farmer Brown has 20 cows and 40 chickens.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs can be calculated as follows:

- Legs from cows:
  \[
  \text{Legs from cows} = 4 \times c = 4 \times 20 = 80
  \]

- Legs from chickens:
  \[
  \text{Legs from chickens} = 2 \times h = 2 \times 40 = 80
  \]

Now, we can add the legs from both types of animals:

\[
\text{Total legs} = \text{Legs from cows} + \text{Legs from chickens} = 80 + 80 = 160
\]

Thus, the total number of legs of all the animals together is \( \boxed{160} \).",0.00220795,10.713824033737183,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,

- **Distance to friend's house**: 200 miles + 10 miles (detour) = 210 miles
- **Speed**: 70 mph

To find the time taken to drive to his friend's house, we use the formula:

\[

From the problem, we know the following:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- She gathers half of that from the shortest trees, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
- Therefore, the total number of apples Joanne gathers is:
  \[

Now, let's analyze the apples gathered by her sister:

- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is:

- She gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is:

2. **Trade**: She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies.
3. **Sapphires after trade**: 
   \[
   8 - 3 = 5 \text{ sapphires}

Let:
- \( A \) be the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( B \) be the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

From the problem, we have:
- \( |A| = 9 \) (kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |B| = 6 \) (kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |A \cap B| = 3 \) (kids allergic to both)

We want to find the total number of kids who are allergic to at least one of the allergens. This can be calculated using the formula:

\[
|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
|A \cup B| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12
\]

This means 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both.

Now, to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids who are allergic from the total number of kids in the class:

\[
\text{Number of kids not allergic} = \text{Total kids} - |A \cup B|

Now substitute both \( L \) and \( D \) into the total equation:

1. **Cost and Yield Analysis**:
   - **2 x 4 piece of wood**:
     - Cost: $4
     - Number of sticks: 200
     - Cost per stick: \( \frac{4}{200} = 0.02 \) dollars per stick

   - **2 x 8 piece of wood**:

2.  **Calculate the total ""person-days"" of work for one whole house:**
    *   It takes 1 person 10 days, so that's 10 ""person-days"" of work.

3.  **Determine how long it takes 5 people to paint one whole house (in days):**

According to the problem:

1. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs:
   \[
   S_O = C_O - 2
   \]
   where \( S_O \) is the number of sofas Ophelia has.

2. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia:
   \[
   C_J = 3C_O
   \]

3. Ophelia has 20 sofas:
   \[
   S_O = 20
   \]

From the first equation, we can find the number of chairs Ophelia has:
\[
20 = C_O - 2
\]
Adding 2 to both sides gives:
\[
C_O = 22
\]

Now, we can find the number of chairs Jenna has using the second equation:
\[
C_J = 3C_O = 3 \times 22 = 66
\]

Next, we can find the number of sofas Jenna has. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs:
\[
S_J = C_J - 2 = 66 - 2 = 64
\]

Now we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have:
- Total sofas:
  \[
  S_O + S_J = 20 + 64 = 84
  \]
- Total chairs:
  \[
  C_O + C_J = 22 + 66 = 88
  \]

Finally, the total number of sofas and chairs combined is:
\[
\text{Total} = (S_O + S_J) + (C_O + C_J) = 84 + 88 = 172
\]

Thus, the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have is \( \boxed{172} \).",0.0036514499999999997,14.949952125549316,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,

2. **Cousin's Age in 8 Years**:
   - Let Jame's cousin's current age be \( x \).
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 22 + 8 = 30 \) years old.
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time:
     \[
     \text{Cousin's age in 8 years} = 2 \times 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55

3. **Setting Up the Equation**:
   - In 8 years, Jame's cousin's age will also be \( x + 8 \).

1. **Total amount Peter has**: $70
2. **Number of days in a week**: 7
3. **Amount spent each day**: \( \frac{70}{7} = 10 \) dollars per day.

Now, let's break down his spending:

### From Sunday through Wednesday (4 days):
- **Cost of wooden action figures**: $5 each
- **Daily spending**: $10

**Number of wooden action figures bought each day**:
\[
\text{Number of figures per day} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ figures}
\]

**Total wooden action figures bought from Sunday to Wednesday**:
\[

Here’s the breakdown of the birds seen each day:

- Days 1 and 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Days 4 and 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

Now, let's calculate the total number of birds:

1. For days 1 and 2, he saw 50 birds.
2. For day 3, he saw 0 birds.
3. For days 4 and 5, he saw 120 birds.
4. For day 6, he saw 20 birds.
5. For day 7, he saw 90 birds.

Now, we sum these amounts:

\[
\text{Total birds} = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

- \(50 + 0 = 50\)
- \(50 + 120 = 170\)
- \(170 + 20 = 190\)
- \(190 + 90 = 280\)

So, the total number of birds Mack saw over the week is 280.

Next, we calculate the average number of birds seen per day:

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. Five years ago, Jerry's age would have been \( x - 5 \). Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
x = 2(x - 5)
\]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

Next, we need to find out how much chocolate Marissa makes in one hour. According to the problem, Marissa makes \( \frac{3}{4} \) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in the two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we calculate Marissa's hourly production as follows:

\[

\]

Now, we can calculate how much chocolate each of them makes in 12 hours.

**For Ruiz:**
\[

1. **Total cost of classes**: Manny's total cost for the Karate classes is $60.
2. **Maximum cost per class**: His parents are willing to pay a maximum of $10 per class.

Next, we calculate the maximum total cost allowed for the classes:

\[
\text{Maximum total cost} = \text{Maximum cost per class} \times \text{Total number of classes}
\]
\[
\text{Maximum total cost} = 10 \text{ dollars/class} \times 10 \text{ classes} = 100 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Manny's classes cost $60, we can find out how many classes he can miss while still keeping the total cost under $100.

3. **Cost per attended class**: If Manny misses \( x \) classes, he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per attended class can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Cost per attended class} = \frac{60 \text{ dollars}}{10 - x}
\]

4. **Setting up the inequality**: We need to ensure that the cost per attended class does not exceed $10:

\[
\frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10
\]

5. **Solving the inequality**:

Multiply both sides by \( 10 - x \) (note that \( 10 - x > 0 \) since he can't miss all classes):

\[
60 \leq 10(10 - x)
\]
\[
60 \leq 100 - 10x

1. **Calculate the raise:**
   - Tim's current salary is $20,000 per month.
   - The raise is 5% of his monthly salary:
     \[
     \text{Raise} = 0.05 \times 20000 = 1000

   - Therefore, his new monthly salary after the raise will be:
     \[
     \text{New Salary} = 20000 + 1000 = 21000

2. **Calculate the bonus:**
   - The bonus is worth half a month's salary based on his original salary:
     \[
     \text{Bonus} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20000 = 10000
     \]

3. **Calculate the total earnings for the year:**
   - First, calculate his total salary for the year with the new salary:
     \[
     \text{Total Salary for the Year} = 21000 \times 12 = 252000

Let:
- \( s \) = number of sheep
- \( g \) = number of geese

We know the following:
1. Each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs.
2. Each animal has 1 head.

From the problem, we can create the following equations:

1. The total number of heads (animals) is 20:
   \[
   s + g = 20
   \]

2. The total number of legs is 70:
   \[
   4s + 2g = 70
   \]

Now we can solve this system of equations.

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[

\]

Now we have the simplified system:
1. \( s + g = 20 \)
2. \( 2s + g = 35 \)

Next, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation:
\[
(2s + g) - (s + g) = 35 - 20

This simplifies to:
\[
s = 15

Now that we have \( s \), we can find \( g \) using the first equation:

2. **Good Days**: She had a total of 12 good days.
3. **Bad Days**: She had a total of 8 bad days.
4. **Neutral Days**: The remaining days are neutral. Since there are 30 days total, we can calculate the neutral days:
   \[

5. **Distribution of Moods**:
   - First 8 days: 8 good days
   - Second 8 days: 8 bad days
   - Third 8 days: 10 neutral days (since she had 10 neutral days, it means the last 6 days must be neutral)
   
6. **Next 3 Days**: The next three days were recorded as good, neutral, and good. This adds:
   - 1 good day
   - 1 neutral day

   - From the first 30 days, she had 12 good days.
   - The next three days added 2 more good days (1 from the first day and 1 from the third day).

- Let \( S \) be the number of cookies Summer has.

From the problem, we know:

1. \( K = M - 5 \) (Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max)
2. \( M = C + 12 \) (Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster)
3. \( S = M + 23 \) (Summer has 23 more cookies than Max)
4. \( K = 68 \) (Katarina has 68 cookies)

Now, we can substitute \( K \) into the first equation:

\[

Adding 5 to both sides gives:

\[
M = 68 + 5 = 73

Now that we have \( M \), we can find \( C \):

Subtracting 12 from both sides gives:

\[

   \[
   T = R + 7
   \]
   where \( R \) is the age of the triplet that is 7 years younger than the twin.

2. The combined ages of the twins and triplets is 44. Since there are two twins and three triplets, we can write this as:
   \[
   2T + 3R = 44
   \]

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation. From \( T = R + 7 \), we can express \( T \) in terms of \( R \):
\[
2(R + 7) + 3R = 44
\]

Expanding this gives:
\[
2R + 14 + 3R = 44
\]

Combining like terms:
\[
5R + 14 = 44
\]

Now, subtract 14 from both sides:
\[
5R = 30
\]

Dividing both sides by 5 gives:
\[
R = 6
\]

Now that we have the age of the triplet, we can find the age of the twin using the first equation:
\[
T = R + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13
\]

Thus, one of the twins is **13 years old**.",0.00315335,14.710018634796143,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,

   - Dora's age = 15 years.

2. **Calculate Dora's father's age**:
   - According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age.
   - Father's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8
   - Father's age = 2 * 15 + 8
   - Father's age = 30 + 8
   - Father's age = 38 years.

3. **Calculate Dora's mother's age**:
   - Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father.
   - Mother's age = Father's age - 4
   - Mother's age = 38 - 4
   - Mother's age = 34 years.

4. **Calculate the total combined age**:
   - Total age = Dora's age + Father's age + Mother's age

       - \( \frac{27}{3} = 9 \) large buttons.

3. **Trading Large Stickers**:
   - Lorraine has 40 large stickers and trades 50% of them for large buttons.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = \( 0.5 \times 40 = 20 \) large stickers.
   - The value of 20 large stickers in large buttons:
     - 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons (since each large sticker is worth 1 large button).

4. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers**:
   - After trading 20 large stickers, Lorraine has:
     - Remaining large stickers = \( 40 - 20 = 20 \) large stickers.
   - She trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons:
     - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons.
     - Therefore, 20 large stickers = \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons.

5. **Total Buttons**:
   - Now, let's sum up all the buttons Lorraine has:
     - From small sticker trade: 9 large buttons.
     - From large sticker trade (50%): 20 large buttons.
     - From remaining large sticker trade: 60 small buttons.

   - Total buttons:
     - Large buttons: \( 9 + 20 = 29 \) large buttons.
     - Small buttons: 60 small buttons.

6. **Final Count**:
   - Lorraine has a total of:
     - 29 large buttons + 60 small buttons = **89 buttons**.

Thus, by the end, Lorraine has **89 buttons**.",0.0074677499999999996,23.82631826400757,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_confidence,

gsm8k,gsm8k-763,TrustRoute-NoCost,2,"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \), the second house as \( y \), and the third house as \( z \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is:
   \[
   x + y + z = 250
   \]

2. The first house needs half of what the second house needs:
   \[
   x = \frac{1}{2}y
   \]

3. The third house needs double what the first house needs:
   \[
   z = 2x
   \]

Now, we can substitute \( x \) and \( z \) in terms of \( y \) into the total equation.

From \( x = \frac{1}{2}y \), we can express \( z \):
\[
z = 2x = 2\left(\frac{1}{2}y\right) = y
\]

Now we can substitute \( x \) and \( z \) into the total equation:
\[
\frac{1}{2}y + y + y = 250
\]

Combining the terms:
\[
\frac{1}{2}y + 2y = 250
\]
\[
\frac{1}{2}y + \frac{4}{2}y = 250
\]
\[
\frac{5}{2}y = 250
\]

To solve for \( y \), multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{5} \):
\[
y = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} = 100
\]

Now that we have \( y \), we can find \( x \) and \( z \):
\[
x = \frac{1}{2}y = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50

\[
z = y = 100

1. **Cost of peaches**:
   - Price per pound: $2.00
   - Pounds picked: 6
   - Total cost for peaches = 6 pounds × $2.00/pound = $12.00

2. **Cost of plums**:

gsm8k,gsm8k-779,TrustRoute-NoCost,2,"To find out how far the Llesis family's vacation spot is, we can break down the problem into two parts: the driving distance and the hiking distance.

1. **Driving Speed and Time**:
   - The average driving speed is 50 miles per hour.
   - The total time for the trip is 6 hours.
   - The time spent hiking is 1.5 hours.
   - Therefore, the time spent driving is:
     \[
     \text{Time driving} = \text{Total time} - \text{Time hiking} = 6 \text{ hours} - 1.5 \text{ hours} = 4.5 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Distance Driven**:
   - The distance driven can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
     \]
   - Thus, the distance driven is:
     \[
     \text{Distance driven} = 50 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4.5 \text{ hours} = 225 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Hiking Speed**:
   - The hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half the driving speed.
   - Half of the driving speed is:
     \[
     \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ miles/hour}
     \]
   - Therefore, the hiking speed is:
     \[
     \text{Hiking speed} = 25 \text{ miles/hour} - 5 \text{ miles/hour} = 20 \text{ miles/hour}
     \]

4. **Distance Hiked**:
   - The distance hiked can also be calculated using the distance formula:
     \[
     \text{Distance hiked} = \text{Hiking speed} \times \text{Time hiking}
     \]
   - Thus, the distance hiked is:
     \[
     \text{Distance hiked} = 20 \text{ miles/hour} \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles}
     \]

5. **Total Distance to Vacation Spot**:
   - The total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:
     \[
     \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance driven} + \text{Distance hiked} = 225 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 255 \text{ miles}

gsm8k,gsm8k-780,TrustRoute-NoCost,2,"To find the difference between Ava's and Emma's scores, we can set up the scoring based on the information provided.

Let:
- \( E \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- \( B \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
- \( T \) be the time in seconds Emma has left when she finishes the level.

From the problem, we know:
- Ava jumps on \( E + 8 \) enemies.
- Ava collects \( B + 3 \) berries.
- Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so she has \( T - 4 \) seconds left.

Now we can calculate their scores:

**Emma's score:**
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Emma}} = 10E + 5B + 30T
\]

**Ava's score:**
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10(E + 8) + 5(B + 3) + 30(T - 4)
\]

Now, let's simplify Ava's score:
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120
\]
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10E + 5B + 30T - 25
\]

Now we can find the difference between Ava's and Emma's scores:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} - \text{Score}_{\text{Emma}}

\[
\text{Difference} = (10E + 5B + 30T - 25) - (10E + 5B + 30T)

Initially, Bob had:
- 3 orange fish
- 4 white fish

After buying \( x \) orange fish and \( y \) white fish, the total number of fish in the pond becomes:
- Orange fish: \( 3 + x \)
- White fish: \( 4 + y \)

According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[
3 + x = 2(4 + y)
\]

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17:

\[
x + y = 17
\]

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. \( 3 + x = 2(4 + y) \)
2. \( x + y = 17 \)

Let's solve the first equation:

\[
3 + x = 8 + 2y
\]
\[
x - 2y = 5 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]

Now we can use the second equation:

\[
x + y = 17 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\]

We can express \( x \) in terms of \( y \) from Equation 2:

\[
x = 17 - y
\]

Now, substitute \( x \) in Equation 1:

\[
(17 - y) - 2y = 5
\]
\[
17 - 3y = 5
\]
\[
-3y = 5 - 17
\]
\[
-3y = -12
\]
\[
y = 4
\]

Now, substitute \( y = 4 \) back into Equation 2 to find \( x \):

\[
x + 4 = 17
\]
\[
x = 17 - 4 = 13
\]

Thus, Bob bought:
- \( x = 13 \) orange fish
- \( y = 4 \) white fish

Therefore, the number of white fish Bob bought at the store is \( \boxed{4} \).",0.0043910500000000005,14.395182132720947,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,

- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt (in ounces).
- Since she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \).
- Let \( o \) be the amount of oil (in ounces).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. \( o = 2s \) (twice as much oil as salt)
2. \( s = 2z \) (twice as much salt as zest)

Now, we can express everything in terms of \( z \):

From \( s = 2z \), we can substitute \( s \) into the equation for oil:

\[
o = 2s = 2(2z) = 4z
\]

Now we can express the total amount of the scrub in terms of \( z \):

\[

1. **Calculate the total number of tins of cat food:**
   - Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food.
   - Each package contains 11 tins.
   - Total tins of cat food = 8 packages × 11 tins/package = 88 tins.

2. **Calculate the total number of tins of dog food:**
   - Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food.
   - Each package contains 6 tins.

gsm8k,gsm8k-825,TrustRoute-NoCost,2,"Let's define the number of cards each person has:

- Let \( P \) be the number of cards PJ has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of cards Smendrick has.
- Let \( B \) be the number of cards Becca has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The total number of cards is 341:
   \[
   B + S + P = 341
   \]

2. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick:
   \[
   B = S + 12
   \]

3. Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has:
   \[
   S = 3P
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( B \) and \( S \) in terms of \( P \) into the total equation.

First, substitute \( S = 3P \) into the equation for \( B \):
\[
B = 3P + 12
\]

Now substitute both \( B \) and \( S \) into the total equation:
\[
(3P + 12) + (3P) + P = 341
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
3P + 12 + 3P + P = 341
\]
\[
7P + 12 = 341
\]

Now, subtract 12 from both sides:
\[
7P = 341 - 12
\]
\[
7P = 329
\]

Now, divide by 7:
\[
P = \frac{329}{7} = 47
\]

Now that we have \( P \), we can find \( S \) and \( B \):
\[
S = 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141
\]
\[
B = S + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153
\]

Thus, the number of cards Becca has is:

2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the first equation.

From equation 3, we can express \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
\[
A = F - 12
\]

Now, substitute \( A \) into equation 2 to find \( S \):
\[

Now we have expressions for \( S \) and \( A \):
- \( S = F + 13 \)
- \( A = F - 12 \)

Substituting these into the total books equation:

(F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85

Let \( x \) be the number of glasses sold by Micah. Since Micah and Mitchell sold the same amount, Mitchell also sold \( x \) glasses.

gsm8k,gsm8k-894,TrustRoute-NoCost,2,"Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.
- Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.

Now, we can calculate how much Tasha made from mowing lawns:

1. **Income from Joe**: Joe paid Tasha $6 for mowing his lawn \( x \) times. Therefore, her income from Joe is:
   \[
   \text{Income from Joe} = 6
   \]

2. **Income from Kamala**: We need to determine how much Tasha earned from mowing Kamala's lawn. Since the problem does not specify how much she charged Kamala, we will assume she charged the same rate of $6 per mow. Thus, her income from Kamala is:
   \[
   \text{Income from Kamala} = 6 \times 3x = 18x
   \]

3. **Income from Alba**: Similarly, we assume she charged $6 per mow for Alba as well. Therefore, her income from Alba is:
   \[
   \text{Income from Alba} = 6 \times 5x = 30x
   \]

Now, we can sum up all her earnings from mowing lawns:
\[
\text{Total income from mowing} = \text{Income from Joe} + \text{Income from Kamala} + \text{Income from Alba} = 6 + 18x + 30x = 6 + 48x
\]

According to the problem, Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[
6 + 48x + \text{Income from lemonade} = 80
\]

Let \( L \) be the income from lemonade sales. Thus, we can rewrite the equation as:
\[
6 + 48x + L = 80
\]

Now, we can solve for \( L \):
\[
L = 80 - 6 - 48x
\]
\[
L = 74 - 48x
\]

Next, we need to find \( x \). Since \( L \) must be non-negative, we set up the inequality:
\[
74 - 48x \geq 0
\]
\[
74 \geq 48x
\]
\[
x \leq \frac{74}{48} \approx 1.54

1. **Total cups of tea**: Lana has 27 cups.
2. **Cinnamon tea cups**: She brews a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea.

Next, we calculate how many cups are left for chamomile and mint tea:

\[
\text{Cups for chamomile and mint tea} = \text{Total cups} - \text{Cinnamon tea cups} = 27 - 15 = 12 \text{ cups}
\]

Now, Lana divides these 12 cups into 3 rows, with equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea in each row. This means that the total amount of chamomile and mint tea (12 cups) is divided equally among the 3 rows.

3. **Cups per row for chamomile and mint tea**:

\[
\text{Cups per row} = \frac{\text{Cups for chamomile and mint tea}}{3} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ cups per row}

1. **Yams**: 
   - Number of yams = 6
   - Price per yam = $1.5
   - Total earnings from yams = 6 yams * $1.5/yam = $9.00

2. **Sweet Potatoes**: 
   - Number of sweet potatoes = 10

gsm8k,gsm8k-945,TrustRoute-NoCost,2,"To find out how long it took James to swim across the lake, we can break the problem down into several steps.

1. **Calculate the distance he swims initially:**
   James swims 60% of the total distance of the lake, which is 20 miles.
   \[
   \text{Distance swum} = 0.6 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to swim the first part:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time for first part} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the resting time:**
   He rests for half the time it took him to swim the first part.
   \[
   \text{Resting time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   The remaining distance after swimming 12 miles is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the speed for the second part:**
   He swims the remaining distance at half his original speed:
   \[
   \text{New speed} = \frac{2 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile/hour}
   \]

6. **Calculate the time taken to swim the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Time for second part} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total time taken:**
   The total time taken is the sum of the time for the first part, the resting time, and the time for the second part:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Time for first part} + \text{Resting time} + \text{Time for second part}

   \[
   \text{Marcus's Age} = \text{Deanna's Age} - 5 = 26 - 5 = 21

gsm8k,gsm8k-950,TrustRoute-NoCost,2,"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. The total points scored by all three players is 45:
   \[
   B + A + D = 45
   \]

2. Bahati scored 20 points more than Azibo:
   \[
   B = A + 20
   \]

3. Bahati scored 10 points more than Dinar:
   \[
   B = D + 10
   \]

Now we can substitute the expressions for \( B \) from the second and third equations into the first equation.

Substituting \( B = A + 20 \) into the total points equation:
\[
(A + 20) + A + D = 45
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2A + D + 20 = 45
\]
Subtracting 20 from both sides gives:
\[
2A + D = 25 \quad \text{(1)}
\]

Next, substituting \( B = D + 10 \) into the total points equation:
\[
(D + 10) + A + D = 45
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
A + 2D + 10 = 45
\]
Subtracting 10 from both sides gives:
\[
A + 2D = 35 \quad \text{(2)}
\]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( 2A + D = 25 \) (1)
2. \( A + 2D = 35 \) (2)

We can solve this system. From equation (1), we can express \( D \) in terms of \( A \):
\[
D = 25 - 2A
\]

Now substitute \( D \) into equation (2):
\[
A + 2(25 - 2A) = 35
\]
Expanding this gives:
\[
A + 50 - 4A = 35
\]
Combining like terms results in:
\[
-3A + 50 = 35
\]
Subtracting 50 from both sides gives:
\[
-3A = -15
\]
Dividing by -3 gives:
\[
A = 5
\]

Now that we have \( A \), we can find \( D \) using \( D = 25 - 2A \):
\[
D = 25 - 2(5) = 25 - 10 = 15
\]

Finally, we can find \( B \) using \( B = A + 20 \):
\[
B = 5 + 20 = 25
\]

To summarize:
- Bahati scored \( B = 25 \)
- Azibo scored \( A = 5 \)
- Dinar scored \( D = 15 \)

From the problem, we have the following equations:

1. The total number of Pokemon caught by all three is 339:
   \[
   A + S + D = 339

Multiplying both sides by 2:

   - The air conditioner runs on low for 3 hours, cooling the room by 2 degrees per hour.
   - Cooling achieved = \( 2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ degrees} \).

2. **Temperature after Low Cooling**:
   - After 3 hours on low, the room temperature is reduced by 6 degrees.

3. **Cooling on High**:
   - The air conditioner then runs on high for 4 hours, cooling the room by 3 degrees per hour.

Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, we can determine that Bill's dad will see the comet again when he is \( D + 75 \) years old.

Now, we know that Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he first saw the comet. Therefore, when Bill's dad first saw the comet at age 30, Bill's age at that time can be denoted as \( B \).

Now, let's express Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time. We can denote this age as \( 3 \times 30 = 90 \) years (since Bill's dad was 30 years old when he first saw the comet).

Now we can set up the equation based on the ages:

1. Bill's dad's age when he saw the comet for the first time: \( 30 \)
2. Bill's dad's age when he saw the comet for the second time: \( 30 + 75 = 105 \)

\[
B + 75 = 90

2. **Gas bill**: 1 check per month

According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. Therefore, the number of flights to Greece is:

\[
\frac{3}{4}x
\]

The remaining flights, which are one-quarter of the total flights, are:

\[
\frac{1}{4}x
\]

These remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. Thus, the number of flights to France is:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{1}{4}x\right) = \frac{1}{8}x

Now, we also know that the second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides by 2:

   - Therefore, Chikote's howl = 2 × 20 seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous' Howl**: 
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - Combined time of Tobias and Chikote = 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.

According to the problem, the total age of the children is 20:

\[

Substituting the known ages:

\[
3 + 4 + H + W = 20

This simplifies to:

Thus, Helene's age can be expressed as:

- \( r \) is the rate of increase (as a decimal),
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) (initial price),

Now, let's calculate the overall probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:

1. **Probability of having to turn in homework with the normal teacher**:
   - Probability of normal teacher: \(0.5\)
   - Probability of no extension: \(0.6\)
   - Probability of not convincing the teacher: \(0.8\)

   The probability of having to turn in homework with the normal teacher is:
   \[
   P(\text{turn in homework | normal teacher}) = P(\text{normal teacher}) \times P(\text{no extension}) \times P(\text{cannot convince}) = 0.5 \times 0.6 \times 0.8
   \]
   \[
   = 0.5 \times 0.48 = 0.24
   \]

2. **Total Probability of having to turn in homework**:
   Since he will not have to turn in homework with the substitute teacher (50% chance), the only scenario where he has to turn in homework is when the normal teacher is present and he cannot convince her for an extension.

   Thus, the total probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is:
   \[
   P(\text{turn in homework}) = P(\text{turn in homework | normal teacher}) = 0.24
   \]

To convert this probability into a percentage:
\[
0.24 \times 100 = 24\%
\]

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is **24%**.",0.0041214500000000005,13.72458267211914,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,

We can set up the equation based on this information:

Now, let's simplify the equation:

1. Combine like terms:
   \[

2. To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 2:

     10 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ bananas}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of bananas eaten by the second monkey in a week:**
   - The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day. Therefore, the second monkey eats:
     \[
     10 \text{ bananas} + 4 \text{ bananas} = 14 \text{ bananas/day}

Together, they have a total of 100 feet of fence, which gives us the equation:

\[
S + H = 100
\]

Substituting \( H \) with \( S + 60 \) in the equation, we have:

\[
S + (S + 60) = 100
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2S + 60 = 100
\]

Now, we can solve for \( S \):

1. Subtract 60 from both sides:

\[
2S = 100 - 60
\]
\[
2S = 40
\]

2. Divide both sides by 2:

\[
S = 20
\]

Now that we have \( S \), we can find out how much Harry gets:

\[
H = S + 60 = 20 + 60 = 80

1. **Calculate the total minutes spent in regular classes during the week:**
   - John has 6 periods each day for 5 days.
   - Each period is 40 minutes long.
   - Total minutes in regular classes = 6 periods/day * 40 minutes/period * 5 days/week.

   \[
   \text{Total minutes in regular classes} = 6 \times 40 \times 5 = 1200 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total minutes spent in extra classes:**
   - John has 2 extra classes each day for 5 days.
   - Each extra class is also 40 minutes long.
   - Total minutes in extra classes = 2 extra classes/day * 40 minutes/class * 5 days/week.

   \[
   \text{Total minutes in extra classes} = 2 \times 40 \times 5 = 400 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total minutes spent in learning during the week:**
   - Total minutes spent learning = Total minutes in regular classes + Total minutes in extra classes.

   \[
   \text{Total minutes spent learning} = 1200 + 400 = 1600 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Calculate the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - Total weekly minutes = 7 days * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 10080 minutes.
   - Extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday = \( \frac{1}{16} \) of total weekly minutes.

   \[
   \text{Extra learning time} = \frac{1}{16} \times 10080 = 630 \text{ minutes}

1. **Determine the speed of each train**:
   - Train A is traveling at 60 miles per hour.
   - Train B is traveling at half that speed, which is \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) miles per hour.

2. **Calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours**:
   - Distance traveled by Train A in 3 hours:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_A = \text{Speed}_A \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles}

Next, let’s denote the number of eggs painted by Sarah as \( y \). Since Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, we can express Camden's number of painted eggs as \( y + 12 \).

According to the problem, Camden and Sarah together painted a total of 30 eggs. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
y + (y + 12) = 30

We know that Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We also know that she spends 40 minutes walking on the beach.

First, we can calculate the time it takes her to walk the 2 miles on the beach:

\[
\text{Time on beach} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{v \text{ miles/hour}}
\]

We know that this time is equal to 40 minutes. To convert 40 minutes into hours, we divide by 60:

\[
40 \text{ minutes} = \frac{40}{60} \text{ hours} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ hours}
\]

Setting the two expressions for time equal gives us:

\[
\frac{2}{v} = \frac{2}{3}
\]

Now, we can solve for \( v \):

\[
2 = \frac{2}{3}v
\]

Multiplying both sides by 3:

\[
6 = 2v
\]

Dividing both sides by 2:

\[
v = 3 \text{ miles/hour}
\]

Now that we have Grandma's speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk:

\[
\text{Speed on sidewalk} = 2v = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles/hour}
\]

Next, we calculate the time it takes her to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk:

\[
\text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{6 \text{ miles/hour}} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ hours}
\]

To convert this time into minutes, we multiply by 60:

\[
\frac{1}{6} \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 10 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we can find the total time for her entire 3-mile walk by adding the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time on beach} + \text{Time on sidewalk} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}

   \]

The total heat content of the mixture is:

1. **Determine the number of scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate:**
   - Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops.
   - Calculation: \( 23 - 5 = 18 \) scoops.

2. **Determine how many potatoes are needed for one scoop of mashed potatoes:**
   - It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - Calculation for potatoes: \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) potatoes.

2. **Outings Per Day**: He goes out 3 times a day.

3. **Face Masks Used Per Day**: 
   - Number of face masks used in one day = Number of outings per day × Face masks used per outing
   - Number of face masks used in one day = 3 outings × 2 masks = 6 masks.

4. **Face Masks Used in 2 Days**:
   - Number of face masks used in 2 days = Face masks used per day × 2 days

- Let \( r \) be the length of the red rope.
- Let \( b \) be the length of the blue rope.
- Let \( y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope:
   \[
   r = 4b
   \]

2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope:
   \[
   b = y - 7
   \]

3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters:
   \[
   r + b + y = 37
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( r \) and \( b \) into the combined length equation.

Substituting \( r \) from the first equation:
\[
4b + b + y = 37
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
5b + y = 37
\]

Next, we can substitute \( b \) from the second equation into this equation:
\[
5(y - 7) + y = 37
\]
Expanding this gives:
\[

2. **Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday:**

   \]

4. **Calculate how many days he can use the remaining chalk before it becomes less than 2 inches:**
   The teacher will continue using chalk until the remaining amount is less than 2 inches. We can set up an equation to find out how many days \(d\) he can use the chalk:
   \[
   \text{Remaining chalk after } d \text{ days} = 2.75 \text{ inches} - 0.55d

   \[
   0.75 \geq 0.55d
   \]
   \[

We have two pieces of information from the problem:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now:
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7)
   \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now:
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} W
   \]

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} W \)

Let's solve these equations step by step.

### Step 1: Substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation.

From the first equation:
\[
W = 5(C + 7)
\]

Substituting this into the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5(C + 7))
\]

### Step 2: Simplify the second equation.

Expanding the right side:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7)
\]

### Step 3: Eliminate the fraction by multiplying through by 3.
\[
3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7)
\]

Expanding both sides:
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

### Step 4: Rearranging the equation.
Now, let's move all terms involving \( C \) to one side and constant terms to the other side:
\[
75 - 35 = 5C - 3C
\]
\[
40 = 2C
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( C \).
\[
C = \frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

### Conclusion
Colin is currently \( \boxed{20} \) years old. 

### Verification
Let's verify the solution:
- If Colin is 20, then in 7 years, he will be \( 20 + 7 = 27 \).
- Wendy's age would then be \( W = 5 \times 27 = 135 \).
- In 25 years, Colin will be \( 20 + 25 = 45 \).
- We check if \( 45 \) is a third of Wendy's current age:

1. **Calculate the selling price**:
   Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them. If she bought the magazines for $72, the selling price can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72

From the problem, we know the following:

1. Dr. Grumpus requested:
   - Test tubes: 16
   - Beakers: 7
   - Petri dishes: 14

2. Igor gathered:
   - Half as many test tubes: \( T = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \)

2. **Distance run by Vanessa**:
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles.

3. **Time taken by Aaron**:
   - Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.

5. **Equating distances**:
   - According to the problem, Vanessa can run twice as far as Aaron. Therefore, if Aaron ran \( d_A = 32v \) miles, then Vanessa ran:
     \[
     d_V = 2 \times d_A = 2 \times 32v = 64v \text{ miles}

Let:
- \( c \) = number of chickens
- \( w \) = number of cows

We have two pieces of information:

1. The total number of animals is 20:
   \[
   c + w = 20
   \]

2. The total number of legs is 70. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs:
   \[

Now we can solve these equations step by step.

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
