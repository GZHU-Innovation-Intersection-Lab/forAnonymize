gsm8k,gsm8k-205,TrustRoute-NoParallel,1,"To find out what score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after dropping the lowest score, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total score needed for an average of 93**:
   Since Brinley will drop the lowest score, we will consider the total of the highest five scores. To find the total score needed for an average of 93 over five tests, we can use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Total score needed} = \text{Average} \times \text{Number of tests}
   \]
   Here, the average is 93 and the number of tests is 5 (after dropping the lowest score):
   \[
   \text{Total score needed} = 93 \times 5 = 465
   \]

2. **Calculate the sum of the first five test scores**:
   Brinley's scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. We need to calculate the sum of these scores:
   \[
   \text{Sum of scores} = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438
   \]

3. **Determine the score needed on the sixth test**:
   Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test. After dropping the lowest score, we want the sum of the highest five scores to equal 465. The lowest score among the five is 71, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   438 + x - 71 = 465
   \]
   Simplifying this gives:
   \[
   438 + x - 71 = 465 \\

1. **Weight of the chocolate bars:**
   - Joe has 25 chocolate bars.
   - Each chocolate bar weighs 40g.
   - Total weight of chocolate bars = Number of chocolate bars × Weight of each chocolate bar
   \[
   \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{g}
   \]

2. **Weight of the candied apples:**
   - Joe has 80 candied apples.
   - Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, we can find the weight of each candied apple.
   - Let the weight of each candied apple be \( x \). Then, we have:
   \[
   40 = 2x \implies x = \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{g}

1. **Cost of the jacket**: $30
2. **Cost of 2 pairs of shoes**: 2 pairs × $20/pair = $40
3. **Total cost**: $30 (jacket) + $40 (shoes) = $70

Next, we calculate how much money Sara has after babysitting and how much more she needs to earn by mowing the lawn.

1. **Earnings from babysitting**: 
   - She babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time.
   - Total earnings from babysitting = 4 × $5 = $20

2. **Total money Sara has before mowing the lawn**:
   - She already had $10 saved.
   - Total money = $10 (saved) + $20 (babysitting) = $30

3. **Amount still needed**:
   - Total cost of jacket and shoes = $70
   - Amount Sara currently has = $30
   - Amount still needed = $70 - $30 = $40

Now, we calculate how much she earns from mowing the lawn.

gsm8k,gsm8k-211,TrustRoute-NoParallel,1,"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, so the total egg production from red chickens is \( 3r \).
2. The white chickens produce 5 eggs a day, so the total egg production from white chickens is \( 5w \).
3. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs every day, which gives us the equation:
   \[
   3r + 5w = 42
   \]
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which gives us the equation:
   \[
   w = r + 2
   \]

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation. Replacing \( w \) in the first equation, we get:
\[
3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
\]

Expanding this equation:
\[
3r + 5r + 10 = 42
\]

Combining like terms:
\[
8r + 10 = 42
\]

Now, we can isolate \( r \) by subtracting 10 from both sides:
\[
8r = 32
\]

Dividing both sides by 8 gives:
\[
r = 4
\]

Now that we have the number of red chickens, we can find the number of white chickens using the equation \( w = r + 2 \):
\[
w = 4 + 2 = 6
\]

Thus, Jerry has:
- Red chickens: \( 4 \)
- White chickens: \( 6 \)

To verify, we can check the total egg production:
- From red chickens: \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) eggs
- From white chickens: \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \) eggs
- Total: \( 12 + 30 = 42 \) eggs, which matches the given condition.

Therefore, the number of red chickens Jerry has is \( \boxed{4} \).",0.00028455,7.35529637336731,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage1_only,

Since both pools leak at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, in 4 minutes, each pool will lose:

\[

Now, substituting \( N = 68 \) into the equations for \( Y \) and \( B \):

1. Calculate Yuri's score:
   \[
   Y = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]

2. Calculate Brianna's score:
   \[
   B = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]

Now we can substitute \( N \), \( Y \), and \( B \) into the total score equation:
\[
68 + 44 + 85 + J = 251
\]

Calculating the sum of \( N \), \( Y \), and \( B \):
\[
68 + 44 = 112
\]
\[
112 + 85 = 197

Now substitute this back into the total score equation:
\[
197 + J = 251

\[
J = 251 - 197 = 54

1. **Determine the number of pen pals Mike has now:**
   - Initially, Mike had 5 pen pals.
   - He stopped being pen pals with 2 of them.
   - Therefore, the number of pen pals he has now is:
     \[
     5 - 2 = 3
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of letters he receives each week:**
   - Each pen pal sends 2 letters a week.
   - With 3 pen pals, the total number of letters he receives is:
     \[
     3 \text{ pen pals} \times 2 \text{ letters/pen pal} = 6 \text{ letters}
     \]

3. **Determine the total number of pages he receives each week:**
   - Each letter is 5 pages long.
   - Therefore, the total number of pages he receives is:
     \[
     6 \text{ letters} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 30 \text{ pages}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of pages he writes in response:**
   - Mike responds in kind, meaning he writes the same number of pages he receives.
   - Thus, he writes 30 pages in response.

5. **Calculate the time it takes him to write those pages:**
   - Mike can write 1 page in 6 minutes.
   - Therefore, the total time he spends writing 30 pages is:
     \[
     30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes}
     \]

6. **Convert the time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
   \[
   R = 6S
   \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
   \[
   R + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation. 

Substituting \( R = 6S \) into the second equation gives us:
\[
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
\]

Now, let's simplify the right side:
\[
6S + 9 = 3S + 27
\]

Next, we can isolate \( S \) by moving all terms involving \( S \) to one side and constant terms to the other side:
\[
6S - 3S = 27 - 9
\]
\[
3S = 18

Now, divide both sides by 3:

S = 6

So, Sam is currently \( 6 \) years old.

R = 6S = 6 \times 6 = 36

Thus, Ruby is currently \( 36 \) years old.

To verify, in 9 years:
- Sam will be \( 6 + 9 = 15 \)
- Ruby will be \( 36 + 9 = 45 \)

And indeed, \( 45 \) is \( 3 \times 15 \).

gsm8k,gsm8k-303,TrustRoute-NoParallel,1,"To find out how much money Elise earned in the second year, we need to first determine how many books she sold in each year.

1. **Determine the number of books sold this year:**
   - This year, Elise sold 45 books.

2. **Determine the number of books sold in the first year:**
   - According to the problem, she sold twice as many books in the first year as she sold this year.
   - Therefore, books sold in the first year = \( 2 \times 45 = 90 \) books.

3. **Determine the total number of books sold over the three years:**
   - There are a total of 250 books, and currently, there are 50 unsold books.
   - Therefore, the total number of books sold = \( 250 - 50 = 200 \) books.

4. **Determine the number of books sold in the second year:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of books sold in the second year.
   - The total number of books sold over the three years can be expressed as:
     \[
     90 \text{ (first year)} + x \text{ (second year)} + 45 \text{ (third year)} = 200
     \]
   - Simplifying this gives:
     \[
     90 + x + 45 = 200

     \[
     x + 135 = 200
     \]
     \[
     x = 200 - 135 = 65
     \]
   - So, Elise sold 65 books in the second year.

5. **Calculate the total earnings from the second year:**
   - Each book sells for $20.
   - Therefore, the total earnings from the second year = \( 65 \text{ books} \times 20 \text{ dollars/book} = 1300 \text{ dollars} \).

Thus, the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is **$1300**.",0.00027269999999999996,6.19341254234314,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage1_only,

   - Watson works 10 hours a day for 5 days a week.
   - Total hours worked per week = 10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week.
   - His hourly wage is $10.
   - Weekly earnings without the bonus = 50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week.

2. **Add the weekly bonus:**
   - Watson receives a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well.
   - Total weekly earnings with the bonus = $500 + $300 = $800/week.

   - At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old six years ago.
   - Therefore, Noah's current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

2. **Population of Chile six years ago**:
   - We are told that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah at that time.

According to the problem:

1. The number of players on the offense is \( 2d \) (twice as many as on defense).
2. The number of players on special teams is \( \frac{d}{2} \) (half the number of players on defense).

The total number of members in the team is given as 105. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
d + 2d + \frac{d}{2} = 105
\]

Now, combine the terms on the left side:

\[
3d + \frac{d}{2} = 105
\]

To combine \( 3d \) and \( \frac{d}{2} \), we can express \( 3d \) with a common denominator of 2:

\[
3d = \frac{6d}{2}
\]

Now, substitute this back into the equation:

\[
\frac{6d}{2} + \frac{d}{2} = 105
\]

Combine the fractions:

\[
\frac{6d + d}{2} = 105
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{7d}{2} = 105
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 2:

\[
7d = 210
\]

Now, divide both sides by 7:

\[
d = 30
\]

Thus, the number of players on the defense is \( \boxed{30} \). 

To verify, we can calculate the number of players on offense and special teams:

- Offense: \( 2d = 2 \times 30 = 60 \)
- Special teams: \( \frac{d}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \)

Now, check the total:

gsm8k,gsm8k-322,TrustRoute-NoParallel,1,"First, let's determine how many pencils Jam has. We know that Jam has 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, totaling 26 pencils. 

Let \( x \) be the number of pencils in each box. Then, we can express the total number of pencils Jam has as:

\[
3x + 2 = 26
\]

Now, we can solve for \( x \):

\[
3x = 26 - 2
\]
\[
3x = 24
\]
\[
x = \frac{24}{3} = 8
\]

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Therefore, Jam has:

\[
3 \times 8 + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26 \text{ pencils}
\]

Next, we know Meg has 46 pencils. Now, we can find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together:

\[
26 + 46 = 72 \text{ pencils}
\]

Now, we need to determine how many boxes are required to store these 72 pencils. Assuming each box can hold 8 pencils (as we calculated earlier), we can find the number of boxes needed by dividing the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box:

\[
\text{Number of boxes} = \frac{72}{8} = 9
\]

Thus, Jam and Meg need a total of **9 boxes** to store all their pencils.",0.00019739999999999997,5.506566286087036,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage1_only,
gsm8k,gsm8k-323,TrustRoute-NoParallel,1,"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is after cooling it by 65 degrees and adding 15 milliliters of cream, we can break down the problem into two parts: the effect of the ice cubes and the effect of the cream.

1. **Cooling with Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - To find out how many ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we divide the total cooling required by the cooling effect of one ice cube:
     \[
     \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, the total weakening from the ice cubes is:
     \[
     \text{Weakening from ice cubes} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

2. **Adding Cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream to her iced coffee. This also weakens the coffee. Since the problem states that any added liquid weakens the coffee, we will assume that the cream also contributes to the weakening by the same amount as its volume (15 milliliters).
   - Therefore, the weakening from the cream is:
     \[
     \text{Weakening from cream} = 15 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

3. **Total Weakening:**
   - Now, we add the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream together:
     \[
     \text{Total weakening} = \text{Weakening from ice cubes} + \text{Weakening from cream} = 60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}

1. **Pink Frog**: We know the pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. **Blue Beetle**: The blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
3. **Green Toad**: The green toad also weighs the same as the pink frog, so it weighs 50 pounds.
4. **Yellow Snake**: The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake. Therefore, the yellow snake weighs:
   \[
   50 \text{ pounds} + 10 \text{ pounds} = 60 \text{ pounds}
   \]
5. **Red Bird**: The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird. Therefore, the red bird weighs:
   \[
   50 \text{ pounds} - 20 \text{ pounds} = 30 \text{ pounds}

Now, we can summarize the weights:
- Pink Frog: 50 pounds
- Blue Beetle: 50 pounds
- Green Toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow Snake: 60 pounds
- Red Bird: 30 pounds

Next, we calculate the total weight of all the animals:

   - Daily energy consumption after reduction = 900 watts/hour × 3 hours = 2700 watts/day.

4. **Convert the new daily energy consumption from watts to kilowatts:**
   - Daily energy consumption in kilowatts after reduction = 2700 watts/day ÷ 1000 = 2.7 kW/day.

5. **Calculate the daily energy savings:**
   - Daily energy savings = Original daily consumption - New daily consumption
   - Daily energy savings = 7.2 kW/day - 2.7 kW/day = 4.5 kW/day.

6. **Calculate the total savings over 30 days:**
   - Total savings = Daily energy savings × Number of days

1. **Calculate the number of sandwiches needed**: 
   Each sandwich serves 4 people. Since there are 20 people in total, we need:
   \[
   \text{Number of sandwiches} = \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people/sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount of meat and cheese needed**: 
   Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. Therefore, for 5 sandwiches, Tyson will need:
   - Meat: 
   \[
   5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound/sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat}
   \]
   - Cheese: 
   \[
   5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound/sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of cheese}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the meat**: 
   The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound. Therefore, the total cost for 5 pounds of meat is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of meat} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 7.00 \text{ dollars/pound} = 35.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost of the cheese**: 
   The cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound. Therefore, the total cost for 5 pounds of cheese is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of cheese} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 3.00 \text{ dollars/pound} = 15.00 \text{ dollars}

   \]

3. **Total Initial Amount**: Before any purchases, Allan has:
   - Cannolis: 40
   - Corn: 80
   - Combined total = 40 + 80 = 120

4. **Purchases**:

1. Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day.
2. He completed half of his steps on his walks to and from school. This means he walked:
   \[
   \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \text{ steps}
   \]
3. He also did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
4. After these activities, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal.

Now, we can calculate the total number of steps he had taken before his jog:

- Steps from walking to and from school: 5,000 steps
- Steps from walking with his friend: 1,000 steps

Adding these together gives:
\[
5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 \text{ steps}
\]

Since he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps, we can confirm this by adding the steps he has taken and the steps left:
\[
6,000 + 2,000 = 8,000 \text{ steps}
\]

However, we need to find out how many steps he took during his jog. Since he has a total of 10,000 steps to reach and he has already taken 6,000 steps, the total steps he needs to take (including the jog) is:
\[
10,000 - 6,000 = 4,000 \text{ steps}
\]

But since he only has 2,000 steps left after his jog, we can conclude that:
\[
\text{Steps taken during jog} = 10,000 - (6,000 + 2,000) = 10,000 - 8,000 = 2,000 \text{ steps}

### May:
- Number of employees hired: 40
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per week: 40

First, we calculate the weekly payment for one employee:
\[
\text{Weekly payment per employee} = \text{Hourly wage} \times \text{Hours worked} = 15 \times 40 = 600 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the total payment for all 40 employees in May:
\[
\text{Total payment for May} = \text{Weekly payment per employee} \times \text{Number of employees} = 600 \times 40 = 24000 \text{ dollars}
\]

### June:
In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. Therefore, the number of employees remaining is:
\[
\text{Employees remaining} = 40 - \left(\frac{1}{4} \times 40\right) = 40 - 10 = 30
\]

Now, we calculate the total payment for the remaining employees in June:
\[

From the problem, we know the following:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- She gathers half of that from the shortest trees, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
- Therefore, the total number of apples Joanne gathers is:
  \[
  30 + 15 + x = 45 + x

Now, let's calculate how many apples her sister gathers:

- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- She gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.

Let:
- \( c \) = number of camels
- \( d \) = number of dromedaries

From the problem, we know:
1. Each animal has one head, so the total number of heads gives us the equation:
   \[
   c + d = 180
   \]

2. Camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump, so the total number of humps gives us the equation:
   \[

   \]

Now we have the following system of equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)  (Equation 1)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \) (Equation 2)

We can solve this system step by step.

First, we can solve Equation 1 for \( d \):
\[
d = 180 - c

     \]

3. **Determine the total savings**:
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

4. **Determine how much he saved from each pair of jeans**:
   - He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans:
     \[
     \text{Savings from jogger jeans} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ dollars}

1. **Initial Preparation**: The caterer prepared enough hot dogs for half of the guests to have two hot dogs each. Since there were originally 36 guests, half of that is:
   \[
   \frac{36}{2} = 18 \text{ guests}
   \]
   Each of these 18 guests would get 2 hot dogs, so the total number of hot dogs prepared is:
   \[
   18 \times 2 = 36 \text{ hot dogs}
   \]

2. **Guests Who Showed Up**: However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hot dog. This means that all 40 guests would want 2 hot dogs each, which totals:
   \[
   40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ hot dogs}
   \]

3. **Calculating Shortage**: The caterer only prepared 36 hot dogs, but 80 hot dogs are needed. To find out how many hot dogs are lacking, we calculate:
   \[
   80 - 36 = 44 \text{ hot dogs short}
   \]

4. **Determining Guests Without Second Hot Dog**: Since there are 40 guests and only 36 hot dogs available, we can distribute the hot dogs. Each of the first 36 guests can receive 1 hot dog. This leaves:
   \[
   40 - 36 = 4 \text{ guests without any hot dog}
   \]
   Now, we need to see how many of these guests can get a second hot dog. Since there are only 36 hot dogs, and each of the first 36 guests can get 1 hot dog, we can give out the remaining hot dogs as second servings.

   However, since there are only 36 hot dogs, and each of the 40 guests wants 2, we can only satisfy 36 guests with their first hot dog. The remaining 4 guests will not receive a second hot dog.

gsm8k,gsm8k-443,TrustRoute-NoParallel,1,"To solve the problem, we first need to calculate Jon's total time for the triathlon and then determine James's total time based on the given information.

1. **Calculate Jon's total time:**
   - Swim: 40 minutes
   - Bike: 1 hour 20 minutes = 80 minutes
   - Run: 50 minutes

   Total time for Jon:
   \[
   \text{Total time (Jon)} = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Calculate James's swim time:**
   James swims 10% faster than Jon. To find his swim time, we first calculate 10% of Jon's swim time:
   \[
   10\% \text{ of } 40 \text{ minutes} = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Therefore, James's swim time is:
   \[
   \text{Swim time (James)} = 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Calculate James's bike time:**
   James takes 5 minutes longer than Jon on the bike:
   \[
   \text{Bike time (James)} = 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Let \( R \) be the time it takes James to run.** 
   Now we can express James's total time:
   \[
   \text{Total time (James)} = 36 + 85 + R = 121 + R \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Since Jon won by 10 minutes, we can set up the equation:**
   \[
   \text{Total time (Jon)} = \text{Total time (James)} + 10
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   170 = (121 + R) + 10
   \]
   Simplifying this gives:
   \[
   170 = 131 + R
   \]
   \[
   R = 170 - 131 = 39 \text{ minutes}

1. **Cost of one pack of razors**: 
   - Each pack costs $4.00.

2. **Number of packs Heather buys**: 
   - She buys 2 packs.

3. **Total cost without discounts**: 
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 2 \text{ packs} \times 4.00 \text{ dollars/pack} = 8.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Buy one get one free offer**: 
   - Since she buys 2 packs, she effectively pays for 1 pack and gets 1 pack free.
   - Therefore, she only pays for 1 pack:
   \[
   \text{Cost after BOGO} = 4.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Applying the $2.00 coupon**: 
   - Subtract the coupon from the cost after the BOGO offer:
   \[
   \text{Final cost} = 4.00 \text{ dollars} - 2.00 \text{ dollars} = 2.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Total number of razors**: 
   - Each pack contains 4 razors, so 2 packs contain:

gsm8k,gsm8k-494,TrustRoute-NoParallel,1,"To find the height of the human pyramid, we need to consider the heights of the cheerleaders and how they are arranged in the pyramid.

1. **Height of the cheerleaders**:
   - 9 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall.
   - 1 cheerleader is 60 inches tall.

2. **Arrangement of the pyramid**:
   - The bottom layer has 4 cheerleaders.
   - The second layer has 3 cheerleaders.
   - The third layer has 2 cheerleaders.
   - The top layer has 1 cheerleader (the shortest one).

3. **Height of each layer**:
   - The height of the pyramid is determined by the tallest cheerleaders in each layer.
   - The bottom layer (4 cheerleaders) will be 64 inches tall.
   - The second layer (3 cheerleaders) will also be 64 inches tall.
   - The third layer (2 cheerleaders) will still be 64 inches tall.
   - The top layer (1 cheerleader) will be 60 inches tall.

4. **Calculating the total height**:
   - The height of the pyramid is the sum of the heights of each layer:
     - Bottom layer: 64 inches
     - Second layer: 64 inches
     - Third layer: 64 inches
     - Top layer: 60 inches

   However, the height of the pyramid is not simply the sum of the heights of each layer. Instead, we need to consider that each layer is stacked on top of the previous one. Therefore, the height of the pyramid is determined by the height of the bottom layer plus the height of the cheerleaders above it.

   The total height of the pyramid can be calculated as follows:
   - Height of the bottom layer: 64 inches
   - Height of the second layer: 64 inches (but this is stacked on top, so we don't add it)
   - Height of the third layer: 64 inches (again, stacked)
   - Height of the top layer: 60 inches (this is the height of the top cheerleader)

   Since the top cheerleader is at the top of the pyramid, we only need to add the heights of the layers that are stacked:

   Total height = Height of bottom layer + Height of the second layer + Height of the third layer + Height of the top layer
   = 64 + 64 + 64 + 60 = 252 inches

5. **Convert inches to feet**:
   - There are 12 inches in a foot, so we convert the total height from inches to feet:

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( L \) and \( D \) into the total equation.

First, substitute \( D \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[
L = \frac{1}{2} B + 7
\]

Now substitute \( D \) into the total equation:
\[
\left(\frac{1}{2} B + 7\right) + \left(\frac{1}{2} B\right) + B = 43

Combine the terms:

- 1 pack of grape gum, which cost $2.
- 1 pack of green apple gum, which cost half as much as the grape gum. Therefore, the cost of the green apple gum is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) dollar.

Now, we can set up the equation for the total cost of all the packs of gum:

gsm8k,gsm8k-505,TrustRoute-NoParallel,1,"To determine the maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make with his budget of $24, we first need to analyze the cost and yield of each type of wood.

1. **Cost and Yield Analysis**:
   - **2 x 4 piece of wood**:
     - Cost: $4
     - Number of sticks: 200
   - **2 x 8 piece of wood**:
     - Cost: $6
     - Number of sticks: 400

2. **Cost per stick**:
   - For a **2 x 4**:
     \[
     \text{Cost per stick} = \frac{4}{200} = 0.02 \text{ dollars per stick}
     \]
   - For a **2 x 8**:
     \[
     \text{Cost per stick} = \frac{6}{400} = 0.015 \text{ dollars per stick}
     \]

From this analysis, we see that the **2 x 8** is cheaper per stick.

3. **Maximizing the number of sticks**:
   - We will first calculate how many **2 x 8** pieces Frederick can buy with his $24 budget:
     \[
     \text{Number of 2 x 8 pieces} = \frac{24}{6} = 4
     \]
   - If he buys 4 pieces of **2 x 8**, he will get:
     \[
     \text{Total sticks from 4 pieces} = 4 \times 400 = 1600 \text{ sticks}
     \]

4. **Verification**:
   - The total cost for 4 pieces of **2 x 8**:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - This fits within his budget.

5. **Conclusion**:
Frederick can make a maximum of **1600 popsicle sticks** by purchasing 4 pieces of **2 x 8** wood.",0.00028169999999999996,10.410550355911255,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage1_only,

2. **Calculate the rate of work for 5 people**:
   - If one person takes 10 days to paint a whole house, the work rate of one person is:
     \[
     \text{Rate of one person} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} = 0.1 \text{ houses per day}

According to the problem:

1. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs:
   \[
   S_O = C_O - 2
   \]
   where \( S_O \) is the number of sofas Ophelia has.

2. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia:
   \[
   C_J = 3 \times C_O
   \]

3. We know that Ophelia has 20 sofas:
   \[
   S_O = 20
   \]

Using the first equation, we can find \( C_O \):
\[
20 = C_O - 2
\]
Adding 2 to both sides gives:
\[
C_O = 22
\]

Now we can find the number of chairs Jenna has using the second equation:
\[
C_J = 3 \times C_O = 3 \times 22 = 66
\]

Next, we can find the number of sofas Jenna has. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs:
\[
S_J = C_J - 2 = 66 - 2 = 64
\]

Now we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs for both Ophelia and Jenna:

- Total sofas:
  \[
  S_O + S_J = 20 + 64 = 84

- Total chairs:
  \[
  C_O + C_J = 22 + 66 = 88

Finally, the total number of sofas and chairs combined is:
\[
\text{Total} = (S_O + S_J) + (C_O + C_J) = 84 + 88 = 172

2. **Adjustments for Extra Hours**:
   - For two consecutive weeks, he spent 5 hours each week instead of 4 hours. The extra hours for these two weeks are:
     \[
     (5 \text{ hours} - 4 \text{ hours}) \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 1 \text{ hour} \times 2 = 2 \text{ extra hours}
     \]
   - In another week, he spent 6 hours instead of 4 hours. The extra hours for this week are:
     \[

     \]

3. **Total Extra Hours**: Adding the extra hours from both adjustments:

2. **Cousin's Age in 8 Years**:
   Let's denote Jame's cousin's current age as \( C \). In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be \( C + 8 \).

3. **Cousin's Age Relationship**:
   According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. In 8 years, Jame will be:
   \[
   \text{Jame's Age in 8 Years} = 22 + 8 = 30 \text{ years old}

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark:
   \[
   R = M + 20
   \]
   Substituting \( R = 80 \):
   \[
   80 = M + 20

3. **Calculate the total number of utensils Judy brought:**
   The total number of utensils (cups + dishes) that Judy brought is:
   \[
   \text{Total utensils by Judy} = \text{Cups} + \text{Dishes} = 12 + 24 = 36
   \]

4. **Determine the number of cups and dishes brought by Judy's friend:**
   Judy's friend brought 40 cups. The number of dishes brought by her friend is 20 more than the number of dishes Judy brought. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought:
   \[
   \text{Dishes by friend} = \text{Dishes by Judy} + 20 = 24 + 20 = 44

1. The number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans:
   \[
   r = b - 0.01b = 0.99b
   \]

2. The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans:
   \[
   g = b + 0.01b = 1.01b
   \]

The total number of jelly beans in the jar is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
r + b + g = 4500
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( r \) and \( g \) in terms of \( b \):
\[
0.99b + b + 1.01b = 4500
\]

Combining the terms:
\[
(0.99 + 1 + 1.01)b = 4500
\]
\[

Now, we can solve for \( b \):
\[
b = \frac{4500}{3.01} \approx 1498.34

gsm8k,gsm8k-603,TrustRoute-NoParallel,1,"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz makes in one hour.

Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so in 1 hour, he makes:

\[
\text{Ruiz's rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour}
\]

Next, we find out how many pounds Marissa makes in one hour. According to the problem, Marissa makes \( \frac{3}{4} \) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in the two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, Marissa's hourly production is:

\[
\text{Marissa's rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 \text{ pounds} = 90 \text{ pounds per hour}
\]

Now, we calculate how much chocolate each of them makes in 12 hours.

For Ruiz:

\[
\text{Total for Ruiz} = \text{Ruiz's rate} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds}
\]

For Marissa:

\[
\text{Total for Marissa} = \text{Marissa's rate} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the total amounts made by Ruiz and Marissa together:

\[
\text{Total chocolate pounds} = \text{Total for Ruiz} + \text{Total for Marissa} = 720 \text{ pounds} + 1080 \text{ pounds} = 1800 \text{ pounds}

1. **Determine the total number of washes Jackie can get from the jumbo bottle**:
   - The directions say that 2 pumps provide 120 washes.
   - Therefore, if Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, she will get:
     \[
     \text{Number of washes} = \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{2 \text{ pumps}} \times 1 \text{ pump} = 120 \text{ washes}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost per wash**:
   - The total cost of the jumbo bottle is $24.00.
   - To find the cost per wash, we divide the total cost by the number of washes:
     \[
     \text{Cost per wash} = \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washes}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per wash}

1. **Initial Funding for the First 5 Months:**
   - Initial funding = $100,000 for 5 months.
   - Monthly funding for the first 5 months = \( \frac{100,000}{5} = 20,000 \) per month.

   Total cost for the first 5 months:
   \[
   5 \text{ months} \times 20,000 = 100,000
   \]

2. **Duration of Research:**
   - Total duration = 10 times the initial duration of 5 months = \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \) months.
   - Additional months = \( 50 - 5 = 45 \) months.

3. **Funding for the Additional 45 Months:**
   - The funding for the months after the first 5 increases by 50% each month.
   - Monthly funding for the 6th month = \( 20,000 \times 1.5 = 30,000 \).
   - Monthly funding for the 7th month = \( 30,000 \times 1.5 = 45,000 \).
   - Monthly funding for the 8th month = \( 45,000 \times 1.5 = 67,500 \).
   - This pattern continues for 45 months.

   The funding for each month can be represented as:
   - Month 6: \( 20,000 \times (1.5)^1 \)
   - Month 7: \( 20,000 \times (1.5)^2 \)
   - Month 8: \( 20,000 \times (1.5)^3 \)
   - ...
   - Month 50: \( 20,000 \times (1.5)^{44} \)

   The total cost for the additional 45 months can be calculated using the formula for the sum of a geometric series:
   \[
   S_n = a \frac{(r^n - 1)}{(r - 1)}
   \]
   where:
   - \( a = 20,000 \) (the first term),
   - \( r = 1.5 \) (the common ratio),
   - \( n = 45 \) (the number of terms).

   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   S_{45} = 20,000 \frac{(1.5^{45} - 1)}{(1.5 - 1)}
   \]

   Now we need to calculate \( 1.5^{45} \):
   \[
   1.5^{45} \approx 11222.7415 \quad (\text{using a calculator})
   \]

   Now substituting back into the sum formula:
   \[
   S_{45} = 20,000 \frac{(11222.7415 - 1)}{0.5}
   \]
   \[
   S_{45} = 20,000 \times 22445.483 = 448,909,660

1. **Total cost of classes**: Manny signed up for Karate classes for $60.
2. **Maximum cost per class**: His parents will not sign him up again if the cost exceeds $10 per class.

Given that there are 10 total classes, we can calculate the maximum total cost allowed for the classes:

\[
\text{Maximum total cost} = 10 \text{ classes} \times 10 \text{ dollars/class} = 100 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Manny's classes cost $60, we need to find out how many classes he can miss while keeping the total cost per class at or below $10.

Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny misses. The number of classes he actually attends will be \( 10 - x \). The total cost per class based on the number of classes attended is given by:

\[
\text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x}
\]

We want this cost to be less than or equal to $10:

\[
\frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10
\]

Now, we can solve this inequality:

1. Multiply both sides by \( 10 - x \) (assuming \( 10 - x > 0 \)):
   \[
   60 \leq 10(10 - x)
   \]
   \[

   \[
   x \leq 4

1. **Base price of the truck**: $30,000

2. **Cost of the king cab upgrade**: $7,500

3. **Cost of leather seats**: 
   - Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade.
   - Cost of leather seats = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 7,500 = 2,500 \)

4. **Cost of running boards**: 
   - Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats.
   - Cost of running boards = \( 2,500 - 500 = 2,000 \)

5. **Cost of the upgraded exterior light package**: $1,500

Now, we can sum all these costs:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Base price} + \text{King cab upgrade} + \text{Leather seats} + \text{Running boards} + \text{Exterior light package}
\]

\[

2. \( s + g = 20 \)

We can solve this system step by step.

First, we can simplify the first equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[
2s + g = 35
\]

Now we have:
1. \( 2s + g = 35 \)
2. \( s + g = 20 \)

Next, we can subtract the second equation from the first:
\[
(2s + g) - (s + g) = 35 - 20
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2s - s = 15
\]
\[
s = 15
\]

Now that we have \( s = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the second equation to find \( g \):
\[
15 + g = 20
\]
\[
g = 20 - 15 = 5
\]

Thus, the number of sheep \( s \) is 15, and the number of geese \( g \) is 5.

To summarize, the number of sheep living on Lee's farm is:
\[
\boxed{15}

4. \( K = 68 \) (Katarina has 68 cookies)

Now, we can substitute \( K \) into the first equation to find \( M \):

\[
68 = M - 5
\]
\[
M = 68 + 5 = 73
\]

Next, we can find the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has using the second equation:

\[
M = C + 12
\]
\[
73 = C + 12
\]
\[
C = 73 - 12 = 61
\]

Now, we can find the number of cookies Summer has using the third equation:

\[
S = M + 23
\]
\[
S = 73 + 23 = 96
\]

Now we have the number of cookies each person has:

- Katarina: \( K = 68 \)
- Max: \( M = 73 \)
- Cookie Monster: \( C = 61 \)
- Summer: \( S = 96 \)

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies:

\[
\text{Total} = K + M + C + S
\]
\[
\text{Total} = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96
\]
\[
\text{Total} = 298
\]

Thus, the total number of cookies they have is \( \boxed{298} \).",0.000279,7.026540517807007,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage1_only,

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length. This means the extension is:

\[
0.5L
\]

After the extension, the length of the dress becomes:

\[
L + 0.5L = 1.5L
\]

Next, she adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom of the dress, making the total length:

2. **Rabbit Mode**: 
   - Time to mow the entire lawn = 40 minutes.

Next, we calculate the time taken to mow half of the lawn in each mode.

2. The combined ages of the twins and triplets is 44. Since there are two twins and three triplets, we can express this as:
   \[
   2T + 3R = 44

1. **Calculate the total cost of the lollipops:**
   - Each lollipop costs $0.40.
   - Manolo bought 5 lollipops.
   - Total cost of lollipops = 5 lollipops × $0.40/lollipop = $2.00.

2. **Determine the total cost of the candies:**
   - Manolo's total expenditure for 5 lollipops and 4 candies is $3.20.
   - We already calculated the cost of the lollipops as $2.00.
   - Let the total cost of the candies be \( C \).
   - Therefore, \( C + 2.00 = 3.20 \).
   - Solving for \( C \):
     \[
     C = 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20

1. **Gissela's Truck Capacity**: 
   Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds.

2. **Gordy's Truck Capacity**: 
   Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck. Therefore, Gordy's truck capacity is:
   \[
   4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Combined Capacity of All Trucks**: 
   The total capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks combined is 11,600 pounds. We can express this as:
   \[
   \text{Gissela's capacity} + \text{Gordy's capacity} + \text{Gary's capacity} = 11600
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   4000 + 4800 + \text{Gary's capacity} = 11600
   \]

4. **Calculating Gary's Capacity**: 
   Now we can solve for Gary's capacity:
   \[
   4000 + 4800 = 8800
   \]
   So we have:
   \[
   8800 + \text{Gary's capacity} = 11600
   \]
   Subtracting 8800 from both sides gives:
   \[

2. **Total slices of pizza**: Each pizza has 12 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices is:
   \[
   5 \text{ pizzas} \times 12 \text{ slices/pizza} = 60 \text{ slices}
   \]

3. **Slices eaten by Bryce and two friends**: Bryce and two of his friends ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizzas. Since there are 3 people:
   - Each person has 12 slices, so:
   \[
   \text{Slices eaten by each of them} = \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ slices}
   \]
   - Total slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends:
   \[

4. **Slices eaten by the two remaining friends**: The other two friends ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizzas. Since there are 2 people:
   - Each person has 12 slices, so:

Topher's shoe length is 8 feet and 4 inches. We can convert this to inches as follows:

1. Convert feet to inches:
   \[
   8 \text{ feet} = 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. Add the additional inches:
   \[

So, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches.

Next, we know from the problem statement that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

Let \( b \) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. Then we have:

   \[
   \text{Weight of Math and Science Books} = 2m + 2s = 2(m + s) \text{ pounds}

2. **French Book**: This book weighs 4 pounds.

3. **English Book**: This book weighs 3 pounds.

4. **History Book**: This book weighs twice as much as the English book. Since the English book weighs 3 pounds, the history book weighs:
   \[
   \text{Weight of History Book} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Now, we can calculate the total weight of all the books. The total weight is the sum of the weights of the math and science books, the French book, the English book, and the history book:
\[

To simplify, we can combine the constant weights:
\[

\]

Since we do not know the exact number of math and science books, we can express the total weight in terms of \( m \) and \( s \). However, if we assume Cindy has at least one math and one science book, we can calculate a specific example. 

For instance, if Cindy has 1 math book and 1 science book:

2. **Trading Small Stickers**:
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   - Since each large sticker is worth 1 large button or 3 small buttons, 27 small stickers can be traded for:

   \]

2. One third of the Pomeranians are girls. Therefore, the number of Pomeranian girls can be expressed as:

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250:
   \[
   x + y + z = 250
   \]

2. The first house needs half of what the second house needs:
   \[
   x = \frac{1}{2}y
   \]

3. The third house needs double what the first house needs:
   \[
   z = 2x
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( x \) and \( z \) in terms of \( y \) into the first equation.

First, substitute \( x = \frac{1}{2}y \) into \( z = 2x \):
\[
z = 2\left(\frac{1}{2}y\right) = y
\]

Now we can rewrite the total equation:
\[
x + y + z = 250
\]
Substituting \( x \) and \( z \):
\[
\frac{1}{2}y + y + y = 250
\]

Combine the terms:
\[
\frac{1}{2}y + 2y = 250
\]
\[
\frac{1}{2}y + \frac{4}{2}y = 250
\]
\[
\frac{5}{2}y = 250
\]

Now, solve for \( y \):
\[
y = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} = 100

Now that we have \( y \), we can find \( x \) and \( z \):
\[
x = \frac{1}{2}y = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50

\[
z = y = 100

gsm8k,gsm8k-780,TrustRoute-NoParallel,1,"Let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B \). 

According to the problem:
- Ava jumps on \( E + 8 \) enemies.
- Ava collects \( B + 3 \) berries.
- Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so if Emma has \( T \) seconds left, Ava has \( T - 4 \) seconds left.

Now, we can calculate the scores for both Ava and Emma using the scoring system provided:

**Emma's Score:**
- Points from enemies: \( 10E \)
- Points from berries: \( 5B \)
- Points from time: \( 30T \)

Thus, Emma's total score \( S_E \) is:
\[
S_E = 10E + 5B + 30T
\]

**Ava's Score:**
- Points from enemies: \( 10(E + 8) = 10E + 80 \)
- Points from berries: \( 5(B + 3) = 5B + 15 \)
- Points from time: \( 30(T - 4) = 30T - 120 \)

Thus, Ava's total score \( S_A \) is:
\[
S_A = (10E + 80) + (5B + 15) + (30T - 120)
\]
Simplifying Ava's score:
\[
S_A = 10E + 5B + 30T + 80 + 15 - 120
\]
\[
S_A = 10E + 5B + 30T - 25
\]

Now, we can find the difference between their scores:
\[
S_A - S_E = (10E + 5B + 30T - 25) - (10E + 5B + 30T)
\]
\[
S_A - S_E = -25
\]

Thus, the difference between Ava's score and Emma's score is \( -25 \). This means Ava's score is 25 points less than Emma's score.

Therefore, the difference between their two scores is:
\[
\boxed{25}

gsm8k,gsm8k-783,TrustRoute-NoParallel,1,"Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \( x \) and the number of white fish he bought as \( y \).

Initially, Bob had:
- 3 orange fish
- 4 white fish

After buying more fish, the total number of orange fish becomes \( 3 + x \) and the total number of white fish becomes \( 4 + y \).

According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob found that he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[
3 + x = 2(4 + y)
\]

Additionally, we know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17:

\[
x + y = 17
\]

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. \( 3 + x = 2(4 + y) \)
2. \( x + y = 17 \)

Let's solve the first equation:

\[
3 + x = 8 + 2y
\]
\[
x - 2y = 8 - 3
\]
\[
x - 2y = 5 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]

Now we can rewrite the second equation:

\[
x + y = 17 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\]

Now we can solve these two equations. From Equation 2, we can express \( x \) in terms of \( y \):

\[
x = 17 - y
\]

Now substitute \( x \) in Equation 1:

\[
(17 - y) - 2y = 5
\]
\[
17 - 3y = 5
\]
\[
-3y = 5 - 17
\]
\[
-3y = -12
\]
\[
y = 4
\]

Now substitute \( y = 4 \) back into Equation 2 to find \( x \):

\[
x + 4 = 17
\]
\[
x = 17 - 4
\]
\[
x = 13
\]

Thus, Bob bought:
- \( x = 13 \) orange fish
- \( y = 4 \) white fish

Therefore, the number of white fish Bob bought at the store is \( \boxed{4} \).",0.00031815,6.856170654296875,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage1_only,

1. **Calculate the current total number of stuffed animals:**
   - Stuffed puppies: 3
   - Stuffed koalas: 5
   - Stuffed zebras: 2
   - Stuffed frogs: 4

   Total = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 stuffed animals.

2. **Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles buys.** After buying \( x \) goats, the new total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

3. **Set up the equation for the percentage of stuffed goats:**
   The number of stuffed goats will be \( x \), and we want this to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals:
   \[
   x = 0.30 \times (14 + x)
   \]

4. **Solve the equation:**
   \[
   x = 0.30 \times (14 + x)
   \]
   \[
   x = 4.2 + 0.30x

- \( S \): amount of salt
- \( O \): amount of oil
- \( F \): amount of fragrance
- \( Z \): amount of citrus zest
- \( U \): amount of sugar

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. \( Z = F \) (the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance)
2. \( S = U \) (the same amount of salt as sugar)
3. \( O = 2S \) (twice as much oil as salt)

Now, we can express everything in terms of \( Z \):

From \( S = 2Z \), we can substitute \( S \) in terms of \( Z \):
- \( S = 2Z \)

Since \( Z = F \), we can also express \( F \) in terms of \( Z \):

\[
S + O + F + Z + U = 10
\]

Substituting the expressions we have:

\[
2Z + O + Z + Z + 2Z = 10
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2Z + O + 3Z = 10
\]

Combining like terms gives:

\[
O + 5Z = 10
\]

Now, substituting \( O = 2S = 2(2Z) = 4Z \) into the equation:

\[
4Z + 5Z = 10
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
9Z = 10
\]

Solving for \( Z \):

\[
Z = \frac{10}{9} \text{ ounces}
\]

Now we can find \( S \):

\[
S = 2Z = 2 \times \frac{10}{9} = \frac{20}{9} \text{ ounces}
\]

Now we can find \( O \):

\[
O = 2S = 2 \times \frac{20}{9} = \frac{40}{9} \text{ ounces}
\]

Thus, the amount of oil Tanya uses is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{40}{9}} \text{ ounces} \approx 4.44 \text{ ounces}

   - The distance covered by the kangaroos can be represented as \( D = \text{speed} \times \text{time} \).
   - Let \( v \) be the speed of one kangaroo. Then the distance \( D \) can be expressed as:
     \[
     D = 3v \times 18
     \]
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     D = 54v
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

3. **Calculate the time it takes for the turtles to cross the same distance:**
   - The distance \( D \) is still \( 54v \).
   - The time \( t \) it takes for the turtles to cross the highway can be calculated using the formula \( D = \text{speed} \times \text{time} \):
     \[
     54v = 4 \left(\frac{v}{2}\right) t
     \]
   - Simplifying the right side:
     \[
     54v = 2vt
     \]
   - Now, divide both sides by \( v \) (assuming \( v \neq 0 \)):
     \[
     54 = 2t
     \]
   - Solving for \( t \):
     \[
     t = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \text{ hours}
     \]

Thus, it will take the four turtles a total of **27 hours** to cross the highway.",0.00028544999999999997,8.854194641113281,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage1_only,

Let \( x \) be the amount of money Erika has in her purse. The total amount she has is:
\[
x + 230
\]

Since she needs $400 to buy the laptop, we can write the equation:
\[

- \( I \) is the interest earned.

The interest \( I \) can be calculated using the formula:

Since the problem does not specify the exact number of each type, let's assume you buy \( x \) baskets of green food and \( y \) baskets of red food such that \( x + y = 3 \).

Let’s calculate the total cost based on the number of baskets:

1. **Cost of Green Food**: Each basket costs $25.
   - Total cost for \( x \) baskets of green food = \( 25x \).

2. **Cost of Red Food**: Each basket costs $18, but you get $2 off for each basket of red food.
   - Effective cost per basket of red food = \( 18 - 2 = 16 \).
   - Total cost for \( y \) baskets of red food = \( 16y \).

Now, the total cost \( C \) can be expressed as:
\[
C = 25x + 16y
\]

Since \( x + y = 3 \), we can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
\[
y = 3 - x
\]

Substituting \( y \) into the total cost equation:
\[
C = 25x + 16(3 - x)
\]
\[
C = 25x + 48 - 16x
\]
\[
C = 9x + 48
\]

Now, we can calculate the total cost for different combinations of \( x \) and \( y \):

- If \( x = 0 \) (0 green, 3 red):
  \[
  C = 9(0) + 48 = 48
  \]

- If \( x = 1 \) (1 green, 2 red):
  \[
  C = 9(1) + 48 = 9 + 48 = 57
  \]

- If \( x = 2 \) (2 green, 1 red):

- Let your age be \( x \).
- Your brother's age is \( x + 3 \) (since you are three years younger than him).
- Your sister's age is \( x - 2 \) (since you are two years older than her).
- Your mom's age is \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \) (since her age is one less than three times your brother's age).

Now, we can set up the equation for the sum of all ages:

\[
x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87
\]

Now, let's simplify this step by step:

1. Combine the ages:
   \[
   x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) = 3x + 1
   \]
   
2. Calculate your mom's age:
   \[
   3(x + 3) - 1 = 3x + 9 - 1 = 3x + 8
   \]

3. Now, add all the ages together:
   \[
   3x + 1 + 3x + 8 = 87

1. **Total glasses sold**: 32 glasses.
2. **Glasses sold by Julie**: 14 glasses.
3. **Glasses sold by the boys (Micah and Mitchell)**: Since they sold an equal number of glasses, we can denote the number of glasses each boy sold as \( x \).

Since Julie sold 14 glasses and the total sold is 32, we can set up the equation:

\[
14 + x + x = 32
\]

This simplifies to:

1. **Cost of bacon**:
   - Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total.

2. **Cost of chicken**:
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. Since 5 packs of bacon cost $10, the cost of one pack of bacon is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of one pack of bacon} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Therefore, the cost of one packet of chicken is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of one packet of chicken} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost for chicken is:

3. **Cost of strawberries**:
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, each priced at $4. Therefore, the total cost for strawberries is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of strawberries} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Cost of apples**:
   - Each pack of apples is priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries. Since a pack of strawberries costs $4, the cost of one pack of apples is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of one pack of apples} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost for apples is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of apples} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Total cost of all items**:

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
   - Then, Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times (three times as many as Joe's).
   - The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times (five times as many as Joe's).

2. **Calculate Earnings from Mowing**:
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for mowing his lawn, so from Joe, she made:
     \[
     \text{Earnings from Joe} = 6x
     \]
   - For Kamala, since she mowed her lawn \( 3x \) times, her earnings from Kamala would be:
     \[
     \text{Earnings from Kamala} = 6 \times 3x = 18x
     \]
   - For Alba, since she mowed her lawn \( 5x \) times, her earnings from Alba would be:
     \[
     \text{Earnings from Alba} = 6 \times 5x = 30x
     \]

3. **Total Earnings from Mowing**:
   - Now, we can sum up her total earnings from mowing:
     \[
     \text{Total Earnings from Mowing} = 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x
     \]

4. **Total Earnings from All Sources**:
   - We know that Tasha made a total of $80 from both lemonade sales and mowing. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     54x + \text{Earnings from Lemonade} = 80
     \]

5. **Solve for Earnings from Lemonade**:
   - Rearranging the equation gives us:
     \[
     \text{Earnings from Lemonade} = 80 - 54x
     \]

6. **Determine \( x \)**:
   - Since \( x \) must be a whole number (she can't mow a fraction of a time), we can find possible values for \( x \) such that \( 54x \) is less than or equal to 80.
   - The maximum integer \( x \) can be is:
     \[
     54x \leq 80 \implies x \leq \frac{80}{54} \approx 1.48
     \]
   - Thus, \( x \) can only be 1 (since it must be a whole number).

7. **Calculate Earnings with \( x = 1 \)**:
   - If \( x = 1 \):
     \[
     \text{Total Earnings from Mowing} = 54 \times 1 = 54
     \]
   - Now substituting back to find the earnings from lemonade:

3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's ages:

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( P \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation.

First, substitute \( A \) into the equation for \( P \):
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10

Now substitute \( P \) and \( A \) into the combined age equation:

1. **Cost for a 24-hour stay**: 
   - The hotel charges 1600 pesos for a 24-hour stay.

2. **Cost for a 12-hour stay plus additional hours**:
   - Cameron checks in at 5 PM and checks out at 10 AM the next day.
   - From 5 PM to 5 AM is 12 hours.
   - From 5 AM to 10 AM is an additional 5 hours.
   - The cost for the initial 12 hours is 1000 pesos.
   - For the additional 5 hours, the cost is \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 70 \text{ pesos/hour} = 350 \text{ pesos} \).
   - Therefore, the total cost for the 12-hour stay plus additional hours is:

1. **Calculate the amount of hay needed for the goats:**
   - Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay.
   - There are 15 goats.
   - Total hay for goats = Number of goats × Hay per goat
   \[
   \text{Total hay for goats} = 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount of hay needed for the sheep:**
   - Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs.
   - Twice the amount each goat needs = \(2 \times 5 = 10\) pounds.
   - Therefore, each sheep needs \(10 - 3 = 7\) pounds of hay.
   - There are 12 sheep.
   - Total hay for sheep = Number of sheep × Hay per sheep
   \[
   \text{Total hay for sheep} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds}

1. The total points scored by all three is 45:
   \[
   B + A + D = 45
   \]

2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo:
   \[
   B = A + 20
   \]

3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar:
   \[
   B = D + 10
   \]

Now, we can express \( D \) in terms of \( A \) using the equations we have.

From the second equation, we can substitute \( B \) in the third equation:
\[
A + 20 = D + 10
\]
Rearranging gives:
\[
D = A + 10
\]

Now we can substitute \( B \) and \( D \) in terms of \( A \) into the total points equation:
\[
(A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45
\]

Combining like terms:
\[
3A + 40 = 45
\]

Now, subtract 40 from both sides:
\[
3A = 5
\]

Dividing by 3 gives:
\[
A = \frac{5}{3}
\]

Thus, Azibo scored \( \frac{5}{3} \) points. However, this result seems unusual in the context of a scoring system, which typically involves whole numbers. Let's verify the calculations and ensure we have interpreted the problem correctly.

1. If \( A = \frac{5}{3} \), then:
   \[
   B = A + 20 = \frac{5}{3} + 20 = \frac{5}{3} + \frac{60}{3} = \frac{65}{3}

   \[
   D = A + 10 = \frac{5}{3} + 10 = \frac{5}{3} + \frac{30}{3} = \frac{35}{3}
   \]

2. Now, check the total:
   \[
   B + A + D = \frac{65}{3} + \frac{5}{3} + \frac{35}{3} = \frac{105}{3} = 35
   \]

This total does not equal 45, indicating an error in the calculations or assumptions. Let's re-evaluate the relationships:

1. We know:
   \[
   B = A + 20
   \]
   \[
   B = D + 10
   \]

2. Substitute \( D \) from the second equation into the total:
   \[
   B + A + (B - 10) = 45
   \]
   \[
   2B + A - 10 = 45
   \]
   \[
   2B + A = 55

3. Substitute \( B = A + 20 \):

1. **Determine the number of measuring cups**: Jonathan has 2 dozen cups. Since 1 dozen equals 12, we calculate:
   \[
   2 \text{ dozen} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of measuring spoons**: Jonathan has \( \frac{2}{3} \) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, we calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = \frac{48}{3} = 16 \text{ measuring spoons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of utensils before gifting**: The total number of utensils is the sum of measuring cups and measuring spoons:
   \[
   \text{Total utensils} = \text{measuring cups} + \text{measuring spoons} = 24 + 16 = 40

From the problem, we know the following relationships:

1. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason:
   \[
   J = 2A
   \]

2. Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey:
   \[
   A = 2B
   \]

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls:

- Let \( A \) be the number of Pokémon caught by Alex.
- Let \( S \) be the number of Pokémon caught by Stan.
- Let \( D \) be the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe.

From the problem, we have the following equations:

1. The total number of Pokémon caught by all three is:
   \[
   A + S + D = 339
   \]

2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan:
   \[
   A = S + 5
   \]

3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught:
   \[
   S = 4D - 13
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( S \) into the first equation.

Substituting \( A \) from equation 2 into equation 1:
\[
(S + 5) + S + D = 339
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2S + D + 5 = 339
\]
Subtracting 5 from both sides gives:
\[
2S + D = 334 \quad \text{(Equation 4)}
\]

Now, we can substitute \( S \) from equation 3 into equation 4. From equation 3, we have:
\[
D = \frac{S + 13}{4}
\]

Substituting this expression for \( D \) into equation 4:
\[
2S + \frac{S + 13}{4} = 334
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 4:
\[
4(2S) + (S + 13) = 1336
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
8S + S + 13 = 1336
\]
Combining like terms gives:
\[
9S + 13 = 1336
\]
Subtracting 13 from both sides:
\[
9S = 1323
\]
Dividing by 9:
\[
S = 147
\]

Now we have found that Stan has caught \( \boxed{147} \) Pokémon.

To verify, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):

1. Calculate \( A \):
   \[
   A = S + 5 = 147 + 5 = 152
   \]

2. Calculate \( D \) using \( S = 4D - 13 \):
   \[
   147 = 4D - 13

   Adding 13 to both sides:
   \[
   160 = 4D

   Dividing by 4:
   \[
   D = 40

1. Robert has 30 cherries.
2. Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard.

From this, we can find out how many cherries Richard has:

\[
\text{Richard's cherries} = \text{Robert's cherries} - 10 = 30 - 10 = 20
\]

Now we know:
- Robert has 30 cherries.
- Richard has 20 cherries.

Next, we need to find out how many cherries Jerry has. We know that the total number of cherries shared among Richard, Jerry, and Robert is 60. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
\text{Richard's cherries} + \text{Jerry's cherries} + \text{Robert's cherries} = 60

gsm8k,gsm8k-976,TrustRoute-NoParallel,1,"To find out how much Sunny earned for the two days, we need to first determine how many boxes of gingerbread and apple pie he sold on both Saturday and Sunday.

### Step 1: Determine the number of boxes sold

**Saturday:**
- Let \( g_s \) be the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday.
- Let \( a_s \) be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday.

From the problem, we know:
- \( g_s = 10 \) (boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday)
- \( a_s = g_s - 4 = 10 - 4 = 6 \) (boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday)

**Sunday:**
- Let \( g_su \) be the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday.
- Let \( a_su \) be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday.

From the problem, we know:
- \( g_su = g_s + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15 \) (boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday)
- \( a_su = 15 \) (boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday)

### Step 2: Calculate total earnings

Now we can calculate the total earnings for each day.

**Earnings on Saturday:**
- Earnings from gingerbread on Saturday: 
  \[
  \text{Earnings from gingerbread} = g_s \times \text{price per box} = 10 \times 6 = 60
  \]
- Earnings from apple pie on Saturday: 
  \[
  \text{Earnings from apple pie} = a_s \times \text{price per box} = 6 \times 15 = 90
  \]
- Total earnings on Saturday:
  \[
  \text{Total earnings on Saturday} = 60 + 90 = 150
  \]

**Earnings on Sunday:**
- Earnings from gingerbread on Sunday: 
  \[
  \text{Earnings from gingerbread} = g_su \times \text{price per box} = 15 \times 6 = 90
  \]
- Earnings from apple pie on Sunday: 
  \[
  \text{Earnings from apple pie} = a_su \times \text{price per box} = 15 \times 15 = 225
  \]
- Total earnings on Sunday:
  \[
  \text{Total earnings on Sunday} = 90 + 225 = 315
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate total earnings for both days

Finally, we add the total earnings from both days:
\[
\text{Total earnings for two days} = \text{Total earnings on Saturday} + \text{Total earnings on Sunday} = 150 + 315 = 465

When Emil turns 24, he will be \( 24 - 19 = 5 \) years older. Therefore, at that time, his dad's age will be \( D \) and his brother's age will be \( B \).

According to the problem:
1. When Emil is 24, he will be half the age of his dad:

D + 75 = 30 + 75 = 105 \text{ years old.}
\]

Now, let \( B \) be Bill's age when he first saw the comet. The problem states that Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he first saw the comet. 

When Bill's dad first saw the comet, he was 30 years old. Therefore, three times that age is:

\[
3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ years old.}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many years after Bill's dad first saw the comet that Bill saw it again. Since Bill's dad will be 105 years old when he sees the comet again, we can calculate the time that has passed since the first sighting:

\[
105 - 30 = 75 \text{ years.}
\]

This means Bill will see the comet again when he is 90 years old. Since 75 years have passed since his dad first saw the comet, we can express Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time as:

\[
B + 75 = 90.
\]

To find \( B \), we can rearrange the equation:

\[
B = 90 - 75 = 15.
\]

Thus, Bill was **15 years old** when he saw the comet for the first time.",0.00024134999999999998,8.424485206604004,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage1_only,

1. **Electric bill**: Buford writes 1 check per month.
   - Annual checks for electric bill: \( 1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ checks} \)

2. **Gas bill**: Buford writes 1 check per month.
   - Annual checks for gas bill: \( 1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ checks} \)

3. **Church**: Buford writes 2 checks per month.

According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. Therefore, the number of flights to Greece is:

\[
\frac{3}{4}x
\]

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. The remaining flights can be calculated as:

\[
x - \frac{3}{4}x = \frac{1}{4}x
\]

Since these remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{1}{4}x\right) = \frac{1}{8}x
\]

Now, we also know that the second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
44 = \frac{1}{2}x
\]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides by 2:

\[
x = 88
\]

Now that we know the total number of flights the first plane makes in one day is 88, we can find the number of flights to France:

\[
\text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{8}x = \frac{1}{8} \times 88 = 11

Thus, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is:

   - Duration = 2 × 20 seconds = 40 seconds

3. **Igneous's howl**: 
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.

- Akbar's age: \( A = 3 \)
- Alessandro's age: \( Al = 4 \)
- Helene's age: \( H \)
- Wilfred's age: \( W \)

We know that the total age of the children is 20:

\[
A + Al + H + W = 20
\]

Substituting the known ages of Akbar and Alessandro:

\[
3 + 4 + H + W = 20
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
H + W = 20 - 7 = 13

Thus, Helene's age can be expressed as:

\[
H = 2 \times \text{Average age} = 2 \times 5 = 10

Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since there are 4 kids, the total size of the slices for the kids is:

\[
4x
\]

Each adult gets a slice that is twice the size of a kid's slice, which means each adult gets:

\[
2x
\]

Since there are 2 adults, the total size of the slices for the adults is:

- \( P_0 \) is the initial price,
- \( r \) is the rate of increase (as a decimal),
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:

1. **Total Pictures**: Olivia uploaded 72 pictures.
2. **Number of Albums**: She put the pictures into 8 albums.

To find out how many pictures are in each album, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums:

\[
\text{Pictures per album} = \frac{72 \text{ pictures}}{8 \text{ albums}} = 9 \text{ pictures per album}
\]

3. **Selfies and Portraits**: 
   - 3 of the albums were selfies only.
   - 2 of the albums were portraits.

Now, we can calculate the total number of selfies and portraits:

- **Total selfies**: Since there are 3 albums of selfies and each album contains 9 pictures:
\[
\text{Total selfies} = 3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 27 \text{ selfies}
\]

- **Total portraits**: Since there are 2 albums of portraits and each album contains 9 pictures:
\[
\text{Total portraits} = 2 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 18 \text{ portraits}
\]

4. **Remaining Pictures**: The remaining albums (3 albums) must contain the rest of the pictures. Since we already accounted for 5 albums (3 selfies + 2 portraits), we can find the number of pictures in the remaining albums:

\[
\text{Remaining albums} = 8 - 5 = 3 \text{ albums}
\]

The total number of pictures in these 3 albums is:
\[
\text{Remaining pictures} = 72 - (27 + 18) = 72 - 45 = 27 \text{ pictures}
\]

Since there are 3 albums, we can also check:
\[
\text{Pictures per remaining album} = \frac{27 \text{ pictures}}{3 \text{ albums}} = 9 \text{ pictures per album}

1. **Initial Count of Balloons:**
   - Red balloons: 25
   - Green balloons: 7
   - Yellow balloons: 12

   Total initial balloons = 25 + 7 + 12 = 44

2. **Red Balloons Burst:**
   - 40% of the red balloons burst:
     \[

     \]
   - Remaining red balloons:
     \[

3. **Yellow Balloons Released:**
   - Sally accidentally released half of the yellow balloons:
     \[

gsm8k,gsm8k-1030,TrustRoute-NoParallel,1,"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we can break down the problem into different scenarios based on the probabilities given.

1. **Chance of having a substitute teacher (50%)**: If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.
   - Probability of substitute teacher: 50% (0.5)
   - Probability of not having a substitute teacher: 50% (0.5)

2. **If the normal teacher comes in (50% chance)**:
   - There is a 40% chance she will give an extension.
   - Therefore, there is a 60% chance she will not give an extension.
   - If she does not give an extension, there is a 20% chance Marcus can convince her that his dog ate his homework and get a personal extension.
   - This means there is an 80% chance he will not get an extension even if he tries to convince her.

Now, let's calculate the probabilities step by step:

- **Probability of having to turn in homework if the normal teacher comes in**:
  - Probability of not getting an extension from the teacher: 60% (0.6)
  - Probability of not getting an extension even after trying to convince her: 80% (0.8)
  
  The probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework if the normal teacher comes in is:
  \[
  P(\text{turn in homework | normal teacher}) = P(\text{no extension}) \times P(\text{no personal extension}) = 0.6 \times 0.8 = 0.48
  \]

- **Overall probability of having to turn in homework**:
  - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 0.5 (no homework)
  - Probability of having the normal teacher and having to turn in homework: 0.5 (normal teacher) × 0.48 (turn in homework) = 0.24

Thus, the total probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework is:
\[
P(\text{turn in homework}) = P(\text{substitute}) + P(\text{normal teacher}) = 0 + 0.24 = 0.24

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took \( 2 \times (x + 80) \).

Now, we can express the total amount taken by all three people as follows:

\[
x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920
\]

Now, let's simplify this equation step by step:

1. Combine the terms:
   \[
   x + x + 80 + 2(x + 80) = 1920
   \]
   \[
   x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

2. Subtract 240 from both sides:
   \[
   4x = 1920 - 240

   \[
   4x = 1680

3. Divide by 4:

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.

The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is given as 19. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Now, let's simplify this equation step by step:

1. Combine like terms:
   \[
   2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
   \]

2. To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 2:
   \[
   2(2x + 4) + x = 38
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   4x + 8 + x = 38
   \]

3. Combine the \( x \) terms:
   \[
   5x + 8 = 38
   \]

4. Subtract 8 from both sides:
   \[
   5x = 30
   \]

5. Divide by 5:
   \[
   x = 6
   \]

Now that we have \( x \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in each set:

- Second set: \( x = 6 \)
- First set: \( x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \)
- Third set: \( \frac{x}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \)

Finally, we can verify the total:
\[
10 + 6 + 3 = 19
\]

Thus, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is \( \boxed{10} \).",0.0002592,7.435591220855713,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage1_only,

- \( P \) is the price of the car after \( t \) years,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price of the car,
- \( r \) is the rate of depreciation (as a decimal),
- \( t \) is the number of years since the purchase.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 20000 \) (the initial price of the car),
- \( r = 0.21 \) (21% depreciation),
- \( t = 2010 - 2007 = 3 \) years.

   - Anthony is sending out 700 small coupons.
   - He wants to send out twice as many big coupons.
   - Therefore, the number of big coupons is:
     \[
     2 \times 700 = 1400 \text{ big coupons}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of mailing small coupons**:
   - Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail.
   - The total cost for mailing the small coupons is:
     \[
     700 \times 5 \text{ cents} = 3500 \text{ cents}
     \]

3. **Calculate the cost of mailing big coupons**:
   - Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail.
   - The total cost for mailing the big coupons is:
     \[
     1400 \times 15 \text{ cents} = 21000 \text{ cents}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total postage cost**:
   - Now, we add the costs of mailing both types of coupons:
     \[
     3500 \text{ cents} + 21000 \text{ cents} = 24500 \text{ cents}
     \]

5. **Convert cents to dollars** (if needed):
   - Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can convert the total cost to dollars:
     \[
     24500 \text{ cents} = \frac{24500}{100} = 245 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is **245 dollars**.",0.00023099999999999995,6.894801616668701,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage1_only,

1. **Cost of Butter Without Promotion**:
   - The price of butter is $4.00 per pound.
   - For 6 pounds, the cost without any promotion would be:
     \[
     6 \text{ pounds} \times 4.00 \text{ dollars/pound} = 24.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Understanding the Promotion**:
   - The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means that for every pound of butter purchased, the second pound will cost half price.
   - Therefore, if Dennis buys 2 pounds of butter, he pays full price for the first pound and half price for the second pound.

3. **Calculating the Cost with the Promotion**:
   - For 2 pounds:
     - First pound: $4.00
     - Second pound: $4.00 / 2 = $2.00
     - Total for 2 pounds: $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00
   - Since Dennis needs 6 pounds, we can calculate the cost for 6 pounds by considering it as 3 sets of 2 pounds:
     \[
     3 \text{ sets} \times 6.00 \text{ dollars/set} = 18.00 \text{ dollars}

Substituting the expression for \( H \) into the equation, we get:

     \[
     \text{BMX bikes} = 0.15 \times 300 = 45
     \]
   - The rest were MTB bikes:
     \[
     \text{MTB bikes} = 300 - (\text{Trekking bikes} + \text{BMX bikes}) = 300 - (150 + 45) = 300 - 195 = 105
     \]

2. **Calculate the earnings from each type of bike:**
   - Price of one MTB = $500
   - Price of one BMX = half the price of an MTB = $500 / 2 = $250
   - Price of one Trekking bike = $450

   Now, calculate the total earnings from each type:
   - Earnings from MTB:
     \[
     \text{Earnings from MTB} = \text{MTB bikes} \times \text{Price of MTB} = 105 \times 500 = 52500
     \]
   - Earnings from BMX:
     \[
     \text{Earnings from BMX} = \text{BMX bikes} \times \text{Price of BMX} = 45 \times 250 = 11250
     \]
   - Earnings from Trekking:
     \[
     \text{Earnings from Trekking} = \text{Trekking bikes} \times \text{Price of Trekking} = 150 \times 450 = 67500
     \]

3. **Calculate total earnings:**
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings from MTB} + \text{Earnings from BMX} + \text{Earnings from Trekking}

gsm8k,gsm8k-1088,TrustRoute-NoParallel,1,"To find out how many hours a week John spends learning, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total minutes John spends in regular classes:**
   - John has 6 periods in a day, and each period is typically 40 minutes long.
   - Therefore, the total time spent in regular classes per day is:
     \[
     6 \text{ periods} \times 40 \text{ minutes/period} = 240 \text{ minutes/day}
     \]
   - Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, the total time spent in regular classes per week is:
     \[
     240 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 1200 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total minutes John spends in extra classes:**
   - John has 2 extra classes, each lasting 40 minutes.
   - Therefore, the total time spent in extra classes per week is:
     \[
     2 \text{ classes} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} \times 5 \text{ days} = 400 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total time spent in learning during the week:**
   - The total time spent in learning (regular classes + extra classes) is:
     \[
     1200 \text{ minutes/week} + 400 \text{ minutes/week} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]

4. **Calculate the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - First, we need to find out how many minutes John spends on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. He spends \( \frac{1}{16} \) of his weekly minutes on each of these days.
   - The total minutes in a week is:
     \[
     7 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 10080 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]
   - Therefore, the extra learning time on each weekend day is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{16} \times 10080 \text{ minutes} = 630 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - For both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time is:
     \[
     630 \text{ minutes} + 630 \text{ minutes} = 1260 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total learning time for the week:**
   - Now, we add the extra learning time to the total learning time:
     \[
     1600 \text{ minutes/week} + 1260 \text{ minutes} = 2860 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]

6. **Convert the total learning time from minutes to hours:**
   - To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
     \[
     \frac{2860 \text{ minutes}}{60} \approx 47.67 \text{ hours}

1. **Calculate Lauren's annual retirement expenses**:
   - Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current salary.
   - Current salary = $100,000
   - Annual retirement expenses = 40% of $100,000 = 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000.

2. **Calculate total retirement savings needed for 20 years**:
   - Total retirement expenses over 20 years = Annual retirement expenses * Number of years in retirement.
   - Total retirement expenses = $40,000 * 20 = $800,000.

3. **Determine how much Lauren saves each year**:
   - Lauren saves 20% of her paycheck.
   - Annual savings = 20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000.

4. **Calculate how many years Lauren needs to work to save $800,000**:
   - Total savings needed = $800,000.
   - Years needed to work = Total savings needed / Annual savings.
   - Years needed to work = $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

Since we are not given how many years Lauren has already worked, we cannot determine the exact number of additional years she needs to work without that information. However, if we assume she has not worked any years yet, she would need to work 40 more years to save enough for her retirement.

1. **Calculate the production of the first two workers:**
   - Each of these two workers produces 6 toys per hour.
   - In 10 hours, one worker produces: \(6 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ toys}\).
   - Therefore, two workers produce: \(60 \text{ toys} \times 2 = 120 \text{ toys}\).

2. **Calculate the production of the next two workers:**
   - Each of these two workers produces 4 toys per hour.
   - In 10 hours, one worker produces: \(4 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ toys}\).
   - Therefore, two workers produce: \(40 \text{ toys} \times 2 = 80 \text{ toys}\).

3. **Calculate the total production of the first four workers:**
   - Total toys produced by the first four workers: \(120 \text{ toys} + 80 \text{ toys} = 200 \text{ toys}\).

4. **Determine the total toys needed to fulfill the order:**
   - The manufacturer needs to produce a total of 400 toys.

   - The fifth worker also works for 10 hours, so the total production by the fifth worker is \(10x\).
   - According to the problem, after the shift, they still need 20 toys, which means the fifth worker produced \(200 \text{ toys} - 20 \text{ toys} = 180 \text{ toys}\).

Next, let’s denote the number of eggs painted by Sarah as \( y \). According to the problem, Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so we can express Camden's number of painted eggs as \( y + 12 \).

We know that Camden and Sarah together painted a total of 30 eggs:

\[
y + (y + 12) = 30
\]

Simplifying this equation:

\[
2y + 12 = 30
\]

Subtracting 12 from both sides:

\[
2y = 18

Dividing by 2:

\[
y = 9

Now, we can find out how many eggs Camden painted:

\[

We know the following:

- Distance walked on the beach: 2 miles
- Distance walked on the sidewalk: 1 mile
- Time spent on the beach: 40 minutes (which is \( \frac{40}{60} = \frac{2}{3} \) hours)

First, we can calculate Grandma's speed on the beach using the formula for speed:

\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}
\]

For the beach:

\[
v = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{\frac{2}{3} \text{ hours}} = 2 \times \frac{3}{2} = 3 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Now that we have Grandma's speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk:

\[
\text{Speed on sidewalk} = 2v = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Next, we need to find the time it takes her to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk. Using the speed formula again:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

For the sidewalk:

\[
\text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{6 \text{ miles per hour}} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ hours}

Now, we convert this time into minutes:

\[
\frac{1}{6} \text{ hours} = \frac{1}{6} \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 10 \text{ minutes}

Where:
- \( m_1 = 4 \) ounces (from the 33-degree mug)
- \( T_1 = 33 \) degrees (temperature of the first mug)

1. **Calculate the number of sunflowers sold from the sunflower sales:**
   - Faraday earns $26 from selling sunflowers at $2 each.
   - The number of sunflowers sold can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Number of sunflowers} = \frac{\text{Total earnings from sunflowers}}{\text{Price per sunflower}} = \frac{26}{2} = 13
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of sunflowers sold from the bouquet sales:**
   - Faraday earns $56 from selling bouquets at $8 each.
   - The number of bouquets sold can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Number of bouquets} = \frac{\text{Total earnings from bouquets}}{\text{Price per bouquet}} = \frac{56}{8} = 7
     \]
   - Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers from the bouquets is:
     \[
     \text{Number of sunflowers from bouquets} = \text{Number of bouquets} \times \text{Sunflowers per bouquet} = 7 \times 12 = 84

- Let \( C \) be the number of seashells Carlos collected.
- Let \( J \) be the number of seashells Jim collected.
- Let \( R \) be the number of seashells Carrey collected.

From the problem, we know the following:

1. Jim collected 27 seashells: 
   \[
   J = 27
   \]

2. Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos:
   \[
   J = C + 5
   \]
   Substituting \( J = 27 \) into this equation:
   \[
   27 = C + 5
   \]
   Solving for \( C \):
   \[
   C = 27 - 5 = 22

3. Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey:
   \[
   C = 2R

1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
   - Fruits in year 5: **50**

2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount (50 fruits).
   - Fruits in year 6: \(3 \times 50 = 150\)

3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount (50 fruits).
   - Fruits in year 7: \(7 \times 50 = 350\)

4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. We need to find the production of the 10-year-old tree first.
   
5. **9-year-old tree**: Does not produce any fruits.
   - Fruits in year 9: **0**

6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount (50 fruits).
   - Fruits in year 10: \(20 \times 50 = 1000\)

Now we can find the production for the 8-year-old tree:
- Since the 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits, the 8-year-old tree produces \(1000 - 200 = 800\) fruits.

Now we can summarize the total fruits produced each year:

- Let \( r \) be the length of the red rope.
- Let \( b \) be the length of the blue rope.
- Let \( y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope:
   \[
   r = 4b
   \]

2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope:
   \[
   b = y - 7
   \]

3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters:
   \[
   r + b + y = 37
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( r \) and \( b \) into the third equation. First, substitute \( r = 4b \) into the combined length equation:
\[
4b + b + y = 37
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
5b + y = 37
\]

Next, substitute \( b = y - 7 \) into the equation \( 5b + y = 37 \):
\[
5(y - 7) + y = 37
\]
Expanding this gives:
\[
5y - 35 + y = 37

Adding 35 to both sides:

1. **Determine the total amount of milk purchased**: 
   Mr. Marcellus bought 4000 gallons of milk.

2. **Calculate the amount of sour milk**: 
   Since 2/5 of the milk was sour, we can calculate the amount of sour milk as follows:
   \[
   \text{sour milk} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 = 1600 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the sour milk**: 
   The cost per gallon is $3.5. Therefore, the total cost of the sour milk is:
   \[

gsm8k,gsm8k-1181,TrustRoute-NoParallel,1,"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

We have two pieces of information from the problem:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now:
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7)
   \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now:
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} W
   \]

Now we can solve these equations step by step.

### Step 1: Rewrite the first equation
From the first equation:
\[
W = 5(C + 7) = 5C + 35
\]

### Step 2: Substitute \( W \) in the second equation
Now substitute \( W \) in the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35)
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the second equation
Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5C + 35
\]
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

### Step 4: Rearrange the equation
Now, rearranging gives:
\[
75 - 35 = 5C - 3C
\]
\[
40 = 2C
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( C \)
Now divide both sides by 2:
\[
C = 20
\]

### Conclusion
Colin is currently \( \boxed{20} \) years old.

### Verification
Let's verify the solution:

1. If \( C = 20 \), then in 7 years, Colin will be \( 20 + 7 = 27 \).
   Thus, Wendy's age will be:
   \[
   W = 5 \times 27 = 135
   \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be \( 20 + 25 = 45 \).
   We check if this is a third of Wendy's current age:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} W = \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45
   \]

Both conditions are satisfied, confirming that Colin's current age is indeed \( \boxed{20} \).",0.00031275,13.882200241088867,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage1_only,

1. **Building Rate**: Jay can build 20 snowballs in 1 hour (60 minutes). This means he builds:
   \[
   \frac{20 \text{ snowballs}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ snowballs per minute}
   \]

2. **Melting Rate**: Jay loses 2 snowballs every 15 minutes. This means he loses:
   \[
   \frac{2 \text{ snowballs}}{15 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{2}{15} \text{ snowballs per minute}
   \]

3. **Net Rate of Snowballs**: The net rate of snowballs Jay has after accounting for melting is:
   \[
   \text{Net rate} = \text{Building rate} - \text{Melting rate} = \frac{1}{3} - \frac{2}{15}
   \]

   To perform this subtraction, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 15 is 15. We convert \(\frac{1}{3}\) to have a denominator of 15:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} = \frac{5}{15}

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar**:
   The jar has a square base of 6 inches by 6 inches and a height of 15 inches. The volume \( V \) of the jar can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:

   \[
   V = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = (6 \, \text{inches} \times 6 \, \text{inches}) \times 15 \, \text{inches} = 36 \, \text{inches}^2 \times 15 \, \text{inches} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches}

3. **Calculate the number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar**:
   Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches, so the total number of jelly beans \( N \) that can fit in the jar is:

   \[
   N = \frac{\text{Effective volume}}{\text{Volume of one jelly bean}} = \frac{432 \, \text{cubic inches}}{0.15 \, \text{cubic inches/jelly bean}} = 2880 \, \text{jelly beans}

Carly's class has 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats. Therefore, the total number of treats is:

\[
5 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ treats/person} = 10 \text{ treats}

The total number of treats is the sum of the number of cupcakes and brownies:

\[

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( b \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[

The total number of ice cubes made by Mary is the sum of the strawberry cubes and the blueberry cubes, which can be expressed as:

\[
x + (5x - 4) = 116
\]

Now, we can simplify this equation:

\[
x + 5x - 4 = 116
\]
\[
6x - 4 = 116
\]

Next, we add 4 to both sides of the equation:

   - Number of people = Day 1 + 20 = 50 + 20 = 70

3. **Day 3**: 
   - Number of people = 2 × Day 2 = 2 × 70 = 140

Now, we have the number of people for the first three days:
- Day 1: 50
- Day 2: 70

1. **First 30 seconds**: 
   - Number of kernels popped = 20

2. **Next 30 seconds**: 
   - Popping rate = 3 times the first 30 seconds
   - Number of kernels popped = \(3 \times 20 = 60\)

3. **Next 30 seconds**: 
   - Popping rate = 4 times the initial rate
   - Number of kernels popped = \(4 \times 20 = 80\)

4. **Final 30 seconds**: 
   - Popping rate = half of the previous 30 seconds
   - Number of kernels popped = \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\)

Now, let's sum up the total number of kernels popped during the cooking time:

\[
\text{Total popped} = 20 + 60 + 80 + 40
\]

Calculating this:

\[
20 + 60 = 80

### Meditation
Charisma meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes in the evening, which totals:
- Daily meditation time = 15 minutes (morning) + 15 minutes (evening) = 30 minutes per day.

In 4 weeks (28 days), the total time spent on meditation is:
- Total meditation time = 30 minutes/day × 28 days = 840 minutes.

### Yoga
Charisma practices yoga for 1 hour (60 minutes) 5 days a week. In 4 weeks, the number of weeks is 4, so the total number of yoga sessions is:

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar.

1. **Passion Fruit**:
   - Amount needed: 2 pounds
   - Cost per pound: $6
   - Total cost for passion fruit: \( 2 \, \text{pounds} \times 6 \, \text{dollars/pound} = 12 \, \text{dollars} \)

2. **Jackfruit**:

   - Cost per pound: $10
   - Total cost for honey: \( 2 \, \text{pounds} \times 10 \, \text{dollars/pound} = 20 \, \text{dollars} \)

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost for one jar.

Total cost for one jar:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of passion fruit} + \text{Cost of jackfruit} + \text{Cost of honey}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 12 \, \text{dollars} + 12 \, \text{dollars} + 20 \, \text{dollars} = 44 \, \text{dollars}

The dog digs 6 holes per day, so in 14 days, the total number of holes dug is:

\[
6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes}
\]

Next, when Nate returns, he starts filling in the holes at a rate of 9 holes per day. However, the dog continues to dig 6 new holes every night. Therefore, the net number of holes filled each day is:

\[

Now, we need to determine how many days it will take Nate to fill in all 84 holes at this net rate of 3 holes per day. We can calculate the number of days required as follows:

\[
\frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days}
\]

Finally, to convert the number of days into weeks, we divide by 7:

- Test tubes gathered: \( T \)
- Beakers gathered: \( B \)
- Petri dishes gathered: \( P \)

From the problem, we know the following:

1. Dr. Grumpus requested:
   - Test tubes: 16
   - Beakers: 7
   - Petri dishes: 14

2. Igor gathered:
   - Half the number of test tubes: \( T = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \)
   - Two more than the number of Petri dishes requested: \( P = 14 + 2 = 16 \)
   - The correct number of beakers: \( B = 7 \)

However, Igor lost some beakers on the way to the lab bench. Let's denote the number of beakers lost as \( x \). Therefore, the number of beakers that Igor actually placed on the lab bench is \( B - x = 7 - x \).

Now, we can set up the equation for the total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench:

1. **Understanding the speeds**:
   - Let \( v \) be Vanessa's speed in miles per minute.
   - Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, his speed is \( 2v \).

2. **Distance run**:
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles.
   - Let’s denote the distance Aaron ran as \( d_A \).

3. **Time taken by Aaron**:
   - Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.
   - The distance he ran can be calculated using the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
     \]
   - Therefore, the distance Aaron ran is:
     \[
     d_A = 2v \times 16
     \]

4. **Distance relationship**:
   - We know from the problem that Vanessa can run twice as far as Aaron. Therefore:
     \[
     4 = 2d_A
     \]
   - This implies:
     \[
     d_A = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ miles}
     \]

5. **Finding Aaron's speed**:
   - Now substituting \( d_A \) back into the equation for distance:
     \[
     2 = 2v \times 16
     \]
   - Simplifying this gives:
     \[
     2 = 32v

6. **Calculating Vanessa's time**:
   - Now we can find the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles using her speed:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{4}{v} = \frac{4}{\frac{1}{16}} = 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ minutes}
