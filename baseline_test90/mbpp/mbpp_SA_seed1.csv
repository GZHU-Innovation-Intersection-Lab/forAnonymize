mbpp,Mbpp/620,SA,1,"To solve the problem of finding the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair is divisible, we can follow these steps:

1. **Sort the Input List:** Start by sorting the list of numbers. This helps in ensuring that we only need to check divisibility in one direction (i.e., if `a` divides `b`, then `a` will appear before `b` in the sorted list).

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:** Use a dynamic programming approach to keep track of the size of the largest subset ending at each number. We create an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the size of the largest divisible subset that ends with the `i`-th element.

3. **Iterate and Update:** For each number, check all previous numbers to see if they can form a subset (i.e., if the current number is divisible by the previous number). Update the `dp` array accordingly.

4. **Return the Maximum:** The answer will be the maximum value in the `dp` array.

Here is the Python function that implements this logic:

```python
def largest_subset(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    
    # Sort the numbers
    nums.sort()
    n = len(nums)
    
    # Initialize the dp array
    dp = [1] * n
    
    # Fill the dp array
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:  # Check divisibility
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    
    # The result is the maximum value in dp
    return max(dp)

# Test the function with the provided test case
assert largest_subset([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]) == 4
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We first check if the input list is empty and return 0 if it is.
- The list is sorted to facilitate the divisibility checks.
- We initialize a `dp` array where each index starts with a value of 1, indicating that the minimum size of a subset including that element is at least 1 (the element itself).
- We use nested loops to compare each element with all previous elements, updating the `dp` array based on divisibility.
- Finally, we return the maximum value found in the `dp` array, which represents the size of the largest divisible subset.",0.0003247499999999,15.328552007675173,109,514,gpt-4o-mini,,

Where:
- The base area of a square pyramid with base edge \( a \) is \( a^2 \).

h_t = \sqrt{\left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + h^2}

### Explanation:
- We create a 2D list `bell` where `bell[i][j]` will hold the value of the Bell number.
- The first row of the triangle starts with `1` (since Bell(0) = 1).
- Each element in the `i`-th row is computed based on the previous row, following the Bell triangle properties.
- Finally, the Bell number for \( n \) is found at `bell[n][0]`.

mbpp,Mbpp/125,SA,1,"To solve the problem of finding the maximum difference between the number of 0s and the number of 1s in any substring of a given binary string, we can follow these steps:

1. **Transform the Problem**: Convert the binary string such that '1' becomes -1 and '0' becomes +1. This way, the problem of finding the maximum difference becomes equivalent to finding the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray in the transformed array.

2. **Kadane's Algorithm**: We can utilize Kadane's algorithm to efficiently find the maximum sum subarray, which will give us the result we are looking for.

Here is the implementation of the function:

```python
def find_length(binary_string):
    # Transform the string: '0' -> +1 and '1' -> -1

### Explanation:
- We first convert the binary string into a list of integers where '0' is +1 and '1' is -1.
- We initialize `max_diff` to negative infinity to ensure we can find the maximum correctly.
- We iterate through the transformed array, updating `current_sum` with each element.
- If `current_sum` exceeds `max_diff`, we update `max_diff`.
- If `current_sum` becomes negative, we reset it to 0, as starting a new subarray might yield a higher sum.
- Finally, the function returns the maximum difference found.

- We start by making a copy of the input array `arr` into `max_prod`, which will hold the maximum product of increasing subsequences for each element.
- We use two nested loops: the outer loop (with index `i`) iterates over each element, while the inner loop (with index `j`) checks all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence with the current element.
- If the current element is greater than the previous element, we calculate the potential product and update `max_prod[i]` if this product is greater than the current maximum stored.
- Finally, we return the maximum value from the `max_prod` list, representing the maximum product of any increasing subsequence in the input array.

This algorithm runs in O(n^2) time complexity, which is efficient for reasonably sized arrays.",0.0003136499999999,8.17453122138977,107,496,gpt-4o-mini,,
mbpp,Mbpp/306,SA,1,"To solve the problem of finding the maximum sum of an increasing subsequence from the prefix of an array up to index `i`, while also including a specific element at index `k` (where `k > i`), we can follow these steps:

1. **Find the maximum sum of increasing subsequences** for the elements in the prefix of the array up to index `i`.
2. **Include the element at index `k`** in the sum if it can extend the increasing subsequence.
3. Return the maximum sum obtained.

Here is the implementation of the function:

```python

1. **Initialization**: We create an array `msis` to hold the maximum sums of increasing subsequences that end at each index up to `i`.
2. **Building the `msis` Array**: For each element `arr[j]` (where `j` ranges from `0` to `i`), we check all preceding elements to see if they can contribute to an increasing subsequence.
3. **Finding Maximum Prefix Sum**: The maximum value in the `msis` array gives us the maximum sum of an increasing subsequence from the prefix.
4. **Including the Element at `k`**: We check if the element at index `k` can be included in the sum (i.e., it is greater than `arr[i]`). If it can be included, we add it to the maximum prefix sum; otherwise, we return the maximum prefix sum as is.

# Test the function
assert lps(""TENS FOR TENS"") == 5
```

### Explanation:
1. **String Preprocessing**: The string is transformed to remove spaces and convert it to lower case to ensure uniformity when checking for palindromes.
2. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**: A 2D list `dp` is created where `dp[i][j]` will hold the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the substring `s[i:j+1]`.
3. **Single Character Palindromes**: Each character is a palindrome of length 1, so we initialize `dp[i][i] = 1`.
4. **Filling the DP Table**: We iterate over possible lengths of substrings and fill the table based on character comparisons:
   - If the characters at the beginning and end of the substring are the same, then they contribute to the length of the palindromic subsequence.
   - If they are different, we take the maximum length found by excluding either the start or the end character.
5. **Result**: The value at `dp[0][n-1]` gives the length of the longest palindromic subsequence for the entire string.

This function should accurately compute the longest palindromic subsequence for any input string.",0.0003574499999999,4.971081495285034,95,572,gpt-4o-mini,,

   - If `k` is 1, we return the minimum of the first elements of both arrays.

2. **Recursive Case**:
   - We calculate the indices `idx1` and `idx2` to determine how many elements to consider from each array.
   - If the element at `arr1[idx1 - 1]` is less than `arr2[idx2 - 1]`, it means that the kth element cannot be in the first part of `arr1`, so we discard it and recursively search among the remaining elements.
   - Otherwise, we do the same but discard elements from `arr2`.

- We use two nested loops: the outer loop (`start`) iterates through each starting index for the subarrays, and the inner loop (`end`) iterates through each ending index from the current starting index.
- For each subarray defined by the indices `start` and `end`, we compute the product of its elements and add that product to `total_sum`.
- Finally, we return the computed `total_sum`.

The provided assertion checks that the function works correctly for the input `[1, 2, 3]`, which indeed produces a sum of products equal to 20.",0.00021525,3.906619071960449,99,334,gpt-4o-mini,,

mbpp,Mbpp/137,SA,1,"To create a function that calculates the ratio of zeroes to non-zeroes in an array of integers, we can follow these steps:

1. Count the number of zeroes in the array.
2. Count the number of non-zeroes in the array.
3. Calculate the ratio of zeroes to non-zeroes.
4. Handle the case where there are no non-zeroes to avoid division by zero.

Here's how you can implement this in Python:

```python

This function will utilize a set to track the strings we have seen and check if the reverse of each string exists in that set. If it does, we increment our count.

Here’s how the implementation works:
1. Initialize a set to store the strings.
2. Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of reverse pairs found.

Here's how we can break down the function:

2. **Recursive Case**: For sequences of length greater than 1, iterate through potential starting values and recursively count valid sequences based on the rules provided.

We can implement this logic in the following Python function:

    # Memoization dictionary
    memo = {}

    def count_sequences(last_value, remaining_length):

### Explanation of the Code:
- The function `get_total_number_of_sequences` initializes a memoization dictionary to store previously computed counts for efficiency.
- The helper function `count_sequences` takes the last used value of the sequence and the remaining length of the sequence to be filled.
- The function explores all valid sequences starting from each first value from 1 to `m`, recursively counting valid combinations.
- The result is accumulated in `total_count` and returned at the end.

   - The bitwise OR operator `|` combines these two results.

mbpp,Mbpp/109,SA,1,"To solve the problem of finding the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand Binary String Rotation**: When we rotate a binary string, we take the last character and move it to the front. For example, rotating ""011001"" once gives us ""101100"".

2. **Convert Binary to Decimal**: We need to convert each rotated binary string to its decimal representation to check if it's odd or even.

- We iterate through the number of rotations, creating a new rotated string each time.
- The rotation is calculated by slicing the string appropriately based on the current index `i`.
- We convert the rotated binary string to a decimal integer using `int(rotated, 2)`.
- We check if this decimal value is odd (by checking if `decimal_value % 2 != 0`) and increment the count if it is.

assert combinations_colors([""Red"", ""Green"", ""Blue""], 1) == [('Red',), ('Green',), ('Blue',)]
```

### Explanation:
1. **Importing product**: We import `product` from the `itertools` module, which allows us to create Cartesian products, and with `repeat=n`, it will generate combinations with repetition.
2. **Function definition**: The function `combinations_colors` takes two parameters: `colors`, which is the list of colors, and `n`, which specifies the length of each combination.
3. **Generating combinations**: We call `product(colors, repeat=n)` to generate the combinations and convert the result to a list.
4. **Assertion**: The assert statement tests the function with the provided example to ensure it behaves as expected.

You can test the function with other values of `n` to generate combinations of different lengths.",0.00018345,3.250046730041504,123,275,gpt-4o-mini,,
mbpp,Mbpp/166,SA,1,"To solve the problem of counting the number of pairs of integers in a list that XOR to an even number, we need to understand when the XOR operation results in an even number. 

The XOR of two integers is even if both integers are either even or odd. Therefore, our strategy will be to count how many even and odd integers are in the list and then calculate the number of valid pairs based on these counts.

Here's the implementation of the function:

```python
def find_even_pair(arr):
    even_count = 0
    odd_count = 0
    
    # Count even and odd numbers
    for num in arr:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            even_count += 1
        else:
            odd_count += 1
    
    # Calculate pairs
    # Pairs of even numbers
    even_pairs = even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2
    # Pairs of odd numbers
    odd_pairs = odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2
    
    return even_pairs + odd_pairs

# Test the function with the given assertion
assert find_even_pair([5, 4, 7, 2, 1]) == 4
```

### Explanation:
1. We initialize counters for even and odd numbers.
2. We iterate through each number in the input list and update our counters based on whether the number is even or odd.
3. To find the number of pairs:
   - For even numbers, the number of ways to choose 2 from `even_count` is given by the combination formula `C(n, 2) = n * (n - 1) / 2`.
   - Similarly, we calculate the pairs for odd numbers.
4. Finally, we return the sum of both even and odd pairs.

The function is efficient and works in O(n) time complexity where n is the number of elements in the list.",0.0002544,8.733131408691406,104,398,gpt-4o-mini,,

1. **Initialization**: We initialize `max_product` and `min_product` with the first element of the array. `result` is also initialized to the first element.
  
2. **Iterating through the array**: For each element in the array starting from the second:
   - If the current element is negative, we swap `max_product` and `min_product`. This is because multiplying a negative number by the smallest (most negative) product can yield a new maximum.
   - We update `max_product` to be the maximum of the current number or the product of `max_product` and the current number.
   - We update `min_product` similarly for the minimum.
   - We update `result` to be the maximum of its current value and `max_product`.

3. **Return the result**: After iterating through the array, `result` holds the maximum product of any subarray.

1. Generate all possible subarrays of the input array.
2. Filter out the subarrays that have an odd length.

assert and_tuples((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (5, 2, 3, 6)

However, based on your assertion, it seems you might want to calculate the element-wise maximum between the two tuples instead. Based on the expected output `(0, 0, 2, 1)`, it seems like we're looking for the minimum element-wise results when you subtract the second tuple from the first:

Here’s the corrected function according to the expected output:

```python
def and_tuples(tup1, tup2):

3. **Iteration**: We iterate through each element in the input tuple:
   - **Integer Check**: If the element is an integer and even, we append it to the result list.
   - **Tuple Check**: If the element is a tuple, we recursively call `extract_even` on it. If the returned tuple is non-empty, we append it to the result.
4. **Return Value**: Finally, we convert the `result` list back into a tuple before returning it.

To find integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( ax + by = n \), we first need to check if a solution exists. A solution exists if and only if \( n \) is a multiple of the gcd of \( a \) and \( b \).

2. **Checking for Solution**: In `find_solution`, we first check if \( n \) is a multiple of the gcd. If not, we return `None`.

3. **Finding the Solution**: If a solution exists, we scale \( x \) and \( y \) by \( n // \text{gcd}(a, b) \) to get the specific solution for \( ax + by = n \).

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing `max_so_far` and `max_ending_here` with the first element of the array.
2. **Iteration**: We then loop through the array from the second element. For each element, we decide whether to add it to the current sublist (`max_ending_here + arr[i]`) or start a new sublist with the current element (`arr[i]`).
3. **Updating Maximum**: We update `max_so_far` if `max_ending_here` exceeds the previously recorded maximum sum.

2. It iterates through each element in `sorted_list` and checks if the current element is greater than or equal to the `value`.
3. If it finds an element that is greater than or equal to `value`, it returns the index of that element as the left insertion point.

### Explanation:
1. The function `split_Arr` takes two arguments: `arr` (the list to be split) and `n` (the index at which to split).
2. It checks if `n` is a valid index; if not, it raises a `ValueError`.
3. It uses list slicing to create two parts: 
   - `arr[n:]` gives the second part from index `n` to the end.
   - `arr[:n]` gives the first part from the start to index `n`.
4. These two parts are concatenated (`+`) and returned as the output.

mbpp,Mbpp/299,SA,1,"To solve the problem of calculating the maximum aggregate from a list of tuples, we need to sum the scores associated with each individual and then determine which individual has the highest total score. Here’s how you can implement this in Python:

assert max_aggregate([('Juan Whelan',90),('Sabah Colley',88),('Peter Nichols',7),('Juan Whelan',122),('Sabah Colley',84)]) == ('Juan Whelan', 212)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: We create a dictionary called `aggregate_scores` to keep track of the total scores for each individual.
2. **Iteration**: We loop through the list of tuples. For each tuple, we check if the name is already in our dictionary:
   - If it is, we add the current score to the existing total.
   - If it isn’t, we initialize that name in the dictionary with the current score.
3. **Finding the Maximum**: After processing all tuples, we use the `max` function with `aggregate_scores.get` as the key to find the name with the highest score.
4. **Return**: Finally, we return a tuple containing the name with the maximum aggregate score and the score itself.

mbpp,Mbpp/626,SA,1,"To find the area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle with a given radius, we can use the following reasoning:

1. The largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle is an isosceles triangle with its base on the diameter of the semicircle.
2. The height of this triangle will be equal to the radius of the semicircle.
3. The area \( A \) of a triangle is given by the formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
   \]
4. For the isosceles triangle inscribed in a semicircle of radius \( r \), the base is equal to the diameter \( 2r \) and the height is \( r \).

    return sum((2 * i + 1) ** 4 for i in range(n))

# Test the function with the given assertion
assert odd_num_sum(2) == 82
```

### Explanation:
1. The first `n` odd natural numbers can be represented as `1, 3, 5, ...` which corresponds to the formula `2 * i + 1` where `i` ranges from `0` to `n-1`.
2. The fourth power of each odd number is calculated using `(2 * i + 1) ** 4`.
3. The `sum` function aggregates these values to produce the final result. 

You can call `odd_num_sum(n)` where `n` is the count of the first odd natural numbers you want to consider. The assertion provided checks that the function produces the expected result for `n = 2`.",0.0001543499999999,3.055361032485962,89,235,gpt-4o-mini,,

mbpp,Mbpp/61,SA,1,"To solve the problem of counting the number of substrings where the sum of the digits equals the length of the substring, we can follow these steps:

1. Iterate through all possible substrings of the given string.
2. For each substring, calculate the sum of its digits.
3. Compare the sum of the digits to the length of the substring.
4. Count how many such substrings meet the condition.

Here is the implementation of the `count_Substrings` function:

```python
def count_Substrings(s):
    count = 0
    n = len(s)
    
    # Iterate over all possible substrings
    for i in range(n):

# Test the function
assert count_Substrings('112112') == 6

### Explanation:
- We use two nested loops: the outer loop selects the starting index of the substring, and the inner loop extends the substring to include each character up to the end of the string.
- `digit_sum` is used to accumulate the sum of the digits as we extend the substring.
- We check if the current `digit_sum` equals the current length of the substring (`j - i + 1`). If they are equal, we increment our `count`.
- Finally, we return the total count of such substrings.

3. **Handling Duplicates**: If a number's complement is itself (like in the case of pairs of the same number), we calculate combinations of those numbers.

### Explanation:
1. **Length Check**: The function first checks if the lengths of the `colors` and `patterns` arrays are the same. If they are not, it immediately returns `False`.
2. **Mapping Logic**: It uses two dictionaries:
   - `color_to_pattern`: Maps each color to its corresponding pattern.
   - `pattern_to_color`: Maps each pattern back to its corresponding color.
3. **Iteration**: It iterates through both arrays simultaneously using `zip`. For each pair of color and pattern:
   - It checks if the color is already in `color_to_pattern`. If it is, it checks if the existing mapping matches the current pattern. If not, it returns `False`.
   - Similarly, it checks the reverse mapping in `pattern_to_color`.
4. **Return Result**: If all checks are passed, the function returns `True`, indicating that the patterns correspond correctly to the colors.

The main idea is to consider the repeated array and efficiently calculate the maximum sum of subarrays that may cross the boundaries of the original array.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate the maximum subarray sum for the original array using Kadane's algorithm.**
2. **Calculate the total sum of the array.**
3. **Consider the cases where the maximum subarray could include elements from both the end and the beginning of the repeated arrays.**
4. **We need to check the combinations of the original array and its repetitions to ensure we get the maximum possible sum.**

Here's the code that implements this logic:

```python
def max_sub_array_sum_repeated(arr, k):
    def kadane(array):
        max_ending_here = max_so_far = array[0]
        for x in array[1:]:
            max_ending_here = max(x, max_ending_here + x)
            max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)
        return max_so_far

    # Step 1: Calculate max subarray sum for the original array
    max_kadane = kadane(arr)

    # Step 2: Calculate total sum of the array
    total_sum = sum(arr)

    # Step 3: Calculate max sum for wrapping cases
    if k > 1:
        # Max sum for the case where we take the end of the first and the start of the second
        max_suffix = 0
        current_suffix = 0
        for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
            current_suffix += arr[i]
            max_suffix = max(max_suffix, current_suffix)

        max_prefix = 0
        current_prefix = 0
        for i in range(len(arr)):
            current_prefix += arr[i]
            max_prefix = max(max_prefix, current_prefix)

        # If k > 2, we can add (k-2) * total_sum
        max_wrap = max_suffix + max_prefix + (k - 2) * total_sum
    else:
        max_wrap = float('-inf')  # Not applicable if k <= 1

    # Step 4: Return the maximum of the two cases
    return max(max_kadane, max_wrap)

# Test the assertion
assert max_sub_array_sum_repeated([10, 20, -30, -1], 4, 3) == 30
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- The `kadane` function implements Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum within the original array.
- The total sum of the original array is calculated.
- If `k > 1`, we calculate the maximum suffix (sum of elements from the end of the array) and the maximum prefix (sum of elements from the start of the array). This helps in calculating the maximum sum for cases where subarrays span across the boundaries of repeated arrays.
- Finally, we check both the maximum subarray sum found and the maximum sum from the wrapping case, returning the larger of the two. 

This implementation efficiently handles the problem, allowing for an effective solution to finding the largest sum of a contiguous subarray in a repeated array.",0.0004403999999999,6.28732967376709,116,705,gpt-4o-mini,,

The sum of the first \(n\) bits and the sum of the last \(n\) bits can both be represented by the number of 1s in those segments. If we denote the number of 1s in the first \(n\) bits as \(k\), then the number of 1s in the last \(n\) bits must also be \(k\) for their sums to be equal.

The number of ways to choose \(k\) bits to be 1s from \(n\) bits is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{n}{k}\). Since the same applies to the last \(n\) bits, the total number of valid sequences for a fixed \(k\) is \(\binom{n}{k} \times \binom{n}{k}\).

To get the final count, we need to sum this product over all possible values of \(k\) from 0 to \(n\):

\[
\text{count} = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k}^2

This sum can be computed using the identity:
