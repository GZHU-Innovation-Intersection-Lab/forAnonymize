mbpp,Mbpp/620,SC-10,1,"To solve the problem of finding the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair in the subset is divisible, we can use a dynamic programming approach. The idea is to sort the list and then use a dynamic programming array to keep track of the size of the largest divisible subset that ends with each number.

Here's the implementation of the function:

```python
def largest_subset(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    
    # Sort the numbers
    nums.sort()
    
    # Create a DP array to store the size of the largest divisible subset ending at each index
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    
    # Fill the DP array
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:  # Check if nums[i] is divisible by nums[j]
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    
    # The size of the largest subset will be the maximum value in the dp array
    return max(dp)

# Test the function with the provided assertion
assert largest_subset([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]) == 4
```

### Explanation:
1. **Sorting**: We first sort the input list. This helps in ensuring that when we check for divisibility, we only need to check previous elements.
2. **Dynamic Programming Array**: We create a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the size of the largest divisible subset that ends with `nums[i]`. Initially, each element can at least form a subset of size 1 (itself).
3. **Nested Loop**: We use a nested loop where for each element `nums[i]`, we check all previous elements `nums[j]`. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, we update `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.
4. **Result**: Finally, we return the maximum value in the `dp` array, which represents the size of the largest divisible subset.

This implementation runs in O(n^2) time complexity, where n is the number of elements in the input list.",0.0029703,67.5743362903595,,True,

mbpp,Mbpp/125,SC-10,1,"To solve the problem of finding the maximum difference between the number of 0s and the number of 1s in any substring of a given binary string, we can use a modified approach that involves transforming the string and applying a maximum subarray sum algorithm.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Transform the String**: Convert the binary string such that:
   - Each '0' becomes +1 (indicating a gain in the count of 0s).
   - Each '1' becomes -1 (indicating a loss in the count of 1s).
   
   This transformation allows us to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray, which corresponds to the maximum difference between the counts of 0s and 1s.

2. **Apply Kadane's Algorithm**: Use Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sum of the transformed array. This algorithm efficiently finds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in linear time.

3. **Return the Result**: The result from Kadane's algorithm will be the maximum difference between the number of 0s and 1s in any substring.

Here is the implementation of the above logic in Python:

```python
def find_length(binary_string):
    # Transform the binary string into an array of +1 and -1
    transformed = [1 if char == '0' else -1 for char in binary_string]
    
    # Apply Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum
    max_diff = float('-inf')
    current_sum = 0
    
    for value in transformed:
        current_sum += value
        max_diff = max(max_diff, current_sum)
        if current_sum < 0:
            current_sum = 0
            
    return max_diff

# Test the function with the provided assertion
assert find_length(""11000010001"") == 6
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We first create a list called `transformed` where each '0' is replaced with +1 and each '1' with -1.
- We then iterate through this transformed list, maintaining a running sum (`current_sum`) and updating the maximum difference (`max_diff`) whenever we find a new maximum.
- If `current_sum` drops below zero, we reset it to zero, as starting a new subarray from the next element may yield a higher sum.
- Finally, we return `max_diff`, which represents the maximum difference between the number of 0s and 1s in any substring of the original binary string.",0.0029262,55.28705859184265,,True,

1. Initialize a list `max_product` where `max_product[i]` will store the maximum product of an increasing subsequence that ends with the element at index `i`.
2. Set each element of `max_product` to the corresponding element of the input array, since the minimum product for any single element is the element itself.
3. Iterate through each pair of indices `(i, j)` where `j < i`. If the element at index `j` is less than the element at index `i`, update `max_product[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and the product of `max_product[j]` and the element at index `i`.

1. If the characters at the two ends of the substring are the same, then they contribute to the length of the palindromic subsequence. Thus, we can add 2 to the length of the longest palindromic subsequence found in the substring that excludes these two characters.
2. If the characters are different, we take the maximum length found by either excluding the character at the start or the end of the substring.
3. We fill the table for substrings of increasing lengths until we cover the entire string.

Here's the implementation of the function:

```python
def lps(s: str) -> int:
    # Normalize the string by removing spaces and converting to lowercase
    s = s.replace("" "", """").lower()
    n = len(s)
    
    # Create a 2D array to store lengths of longest palindromic subsequences
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    
    # Every single character is a palindrome of length 1
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i][i] = 1
    
    # Build the table
    for length in range(2, n + 1):  # length of the substring
        for i in range(n - length + 1):
            j = i + length - 1  # end index of the substring
            if s[i] == s[j]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j - 1] + 2
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])
    
    # The length of the longest palindromic subsequence is in dp[0][n-1]
    return dp[0][n - 1]

# Test the function
assert lps(""TENS FOR TENS"") == 5
```

This function first normalizes the input string by removing spaces and converting it to lowercase. It then initializes a 2D list for dynamic programming and fills it according to the rules described. Finally, it returns the length of the longest palindromic subsequence.

1. **Define a Bitonic Subsequence**: A bitonic subsequence is one that first increases and then decreases.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: We can use dynamic programming to find the maximum sum of increasing subsequences and then combine these results to find the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence.

3. **Steps to Implement**:
   - Compute the maximum sum of increasing subsequences for each index from the left.
   - Compute the maximum sum of increasing subsequences for each index from the right (which will help in finding the decreasing part).
   - Combine these results to find the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence.

- We fill the `inc` array by iterating through the array and checking for increasing elements.
- We fill the `dec` array similarly but in reverse order to check for decreasing elements.
- Finally, we calculate the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence by combining the results from `inc` and `dec`, subtracting the current element to avoid double counting.

1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks if the first array is larger than the second. If so, it swaps them to ensure that `arr1` is the smaller array.
2. **Base Cases**:
   - If `arr1` is empty, it returns the k-th element from `arr2`.
   - If `k` is 1, it returns the minimum of the first elements of both arrays.
3. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - It calculates the midpoints `i` and `j` for `arr1` and `arr2`, respectively.
   - It compares the elements at these midpoints and discards the half of the array that cannot contain the k-th element.
4. **Recursive Call**: The function calls itself with the remaining elements and the adjusted value of `k`.

The idea is to maintain a table that keeps track of the maximum total cost and the number of cells visited to reach each cell in the matrix.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Initialization**: Create a 2D list `dp` where `dp[i][j]` will store a tuple of the maximum total cost to reach cell `(i, j)` and the number of cells visited to reach that cell.

2. **Base Case**: Start from the top-left corner `(0, 0)`, where the cost is simply the value of the cell itself, and the number of cells visited is 1.

3. **Filling the DP Table**: Iterate through the matrix and for each cell `(i, j)`, update its value based on the maximum cost from the cell above `(i-1, j)` and the cell to the left `(i, j-1)`.

4. **Calculate the Average**: Once we reach the bottom-right corner, calculate the average by dividing the total cost by the number of cells visited.

5. **Return the Result**: The result will be the maximum average found.

Here's the implementation of the above logic in Python:

# Example usage

### Explanation:
1. **Function Definition**: The function `get_total_number_of_sequences(m, n)` takes two parameters: `m` (the upper limit for the sequence elements) and `n` (the length of the sequence).

2. **Memoization**: We use a dictionary `memo` to store results of previously computed states to avoid redundant calculations.

3. **Recursive Function**: The inner function `count_sequences(last_element, remaining_length)` computes the number of valid sequences starting with `last_element` and having `remaining_length` elements left to place.

4. **Base Case**: If `remaining_length` is 0, it means we have successfully formed a valid sequence, so we return 1.

5. **Counting Sequences**: We start from `2 * last_element` (the minimum value for the next element) and count all valid sequences until `m`.

6. **Iterate Over First Elements**: We iterate over all possible first elements from 1 to `m` and sum the counts of valid sequences starting from each.

7. **Return the Total Count**: Finally, we return the total count of valid sequences.

This implementation efficiently calculates the number of valid sequences while adhering to the constraints provided.",0.0036560999999999,83.9844298362732,,True,
mbpp,Mbpp/799,SC-10,1,"To create a function that rotates the bits of a given 32-bit number to the left by a specified number of bits, we can follow these steps:

1. Use the bitwise left shift operator to shift the number to the left by `d` bits.
2. Use the bitwise right shift operator to shift the number to the right by `(32 - d)` bits to wrap around the bits that overflow.
3. Combine the results using the bitwise OR operator.
4. Ensure the result is within the 32-bit range by applying a mask.

Here's the implementation of the `left_rotate` function:

```python
def left_rotate(n, d):
    # Ensure d is within the range of 0-31
    d = d % 32
    # Perform the left rotation
    return ((n << d) | (n >> (32 - d))) & 0xFFFFFFFF

# Test the function with the provided assertion
assert left_rotate(16, 2) == 64
```

### Explanation:
- `n << d`: This shifts the bits of `n` to the left by `d` positions.
- `n >> (32 - d)`: This shifts the bits of `n` to the right by `(32 - d)` positions, effectively wrapping the bits around.
- The bitwise OR (`|`) combines the two results.
- `& 0xFFFFFFFF`: This ensures that the result is treated as a 32-bit number, discarding any overflow bits beyond the 32nd bit.

mbpp,Mbpp/109,SC-10,1,"To solve the problem of finding the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string a given number of times, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Rotation**: Rotating a binary string means moving the first character to the end of the string. For example, rotating ""011001"" once results in ""110010"".

2. **Convert to Decimal**: For each rotated binary string, we need to convert it to its decimal equivalent and check if that number is odd.

3. **Count Odd Values**: We will maintain a count of how many of these decimal values are odd.

Here is the implementation of the function:

### Explanation:
- We loop through the number of rotations.
- For each rotation, we create a new rotated string.
- We convert this string from binary to decimal using `int(rotated_string, 2)`.
- We check if the decimal value is odd by using the modulus operator `%`.

1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing `max_product`, `min_product`, and `result` with the first element of the array.
2. **Iterate through the array**: For each element in the array:
   - If the current element is negative, we swap `max_product` and `min_product` because multiplying by a negative number will change the sign of the products.
   - We then update `max_product` to be the maximum of the current element and the product of `max_product` with the current element.
   - Similarly, we update `min_product` to be the minimum of the current element and the product of `min_product` with the current element.
   - Finally, we update `result` to be the maximum of itself and `max_product`.
3. **Return the result**: After processing all elements, we return the maximum product found.

The function will check each element, and if it is an integer, it will include it in the result only if it is even.

5. **Recursive Call**: If the element is a tuple, we call `extract_even` recursively and check if the returned tuple is non-empty before appending it to the result.
6. **Return Value**: Finally, we convert the result list back to a tuple and return it.

Here's how we can implement the function `find_solution`:

1. A rotation of a string involves moving characters from the front to the back. For example, rotating ""abcd"" once gives ""bcda"".
2. We need to determine how many rotations are needed until the string returns to its original form.
3. We can achieve this by checking each possible rotation of the string and comparing it to the original string.

Here's a Python function that implements this logic:

```python
def find_Rotations(s):
    n = len(s)

    return n  # In case the string is made of unique characters, it will return n

# Test the function with the provided assertion
assert find_Rotations(""aaaa"") == 1
```

### Explanation:
- The function `find_Rotations` takes a string `s` as input.
- It iterates through possible rotation counts from 1 to the length of the string.
- For each rotation count `i`, it creates a rotated version of the string.
- If the rotated string matches the original string, it returns the count `i`.
- The function also handles the case where all characters are unique by returning `n`, but this is not necessary for the given test case.

### Explanation:
1. The function `even_Power_Sum` takes an integer `n` as input.
2. It uses a generator expression to iterate over the first `n` natural numbers (from 1 to `n`).
3. For each natural number `i`, it calculates the `i`-th even natural number as `2 * i` and raises it to the fifth power.

mbpp,Mbpp/780,SC-10,1,"To solve the problem of finding combinations of sums with tuples in a given list of tuples, we can follow these steps:

1. Iterate through each pair of tuples in the list.
2. For each pair, compute the sum of the first elements and the sum of the second elements.
3. Store the resulting sums as tuples in a result list.
4. Ensure that we do not include duplicate combinations.

Here is the implementation of the `find_combinations` function:

```

### Explanation:
- We use a nested loop to iterate through all pairs of tuples in the input list.
- For each pair of tuples, we calculate the sum of the first elements and the sum of the second elements.
- We store the resulting tuples in a set to automatically handle duplicates.
- Finally, we convert the set back to a list before returning it.

mbpp,Mbpp/735,SC-10,1,"To toggle the bits of a number except for the first and last bits, we can follow these steps:

1. Convert the number to its binary representation.
2. Identify the first and last bits.
3. Toggle the bits in between the first and last bits.
4. Convert the modified binary representation back to a decimal number.

Here's the implementation of the `toggle_middle_bits` function:

```python
def toggle_middle_bits(n):
    # Convert the number to binary and remove the '0b' prefix
    binary = bin(n)[2:]
    
    # If the number has less than 3 bits, return it as is

    # Convert back to decimal
    return int(new_binary, 2)

# Test the function with the provided assertion
assert toggle_middle_bits(9) == 15
```

### Explanation:
- We first convert the number to binary using `bin(n)[2:]` to get the binary string without the '0b' prefix.
- We check if the length of the binary string is less than or equal to 2. If so, we return the number as is since there are no middle bits to toggle.
- We toggle the middle bits by iterating through the substring of the binary representation that excludes the first and last bits.
- Finally, we construct the new binary string and convert it back to a decimal integer using `int(new_binary, 2)`.

2. It uses `enumerate` to loop through the elements of the tuple, which gives both the index and the element.
3. It checks if the current element is a tuple using `isinstance`.
4. If a tuple is found, it returns the index, which represents the number of elements that occur before it.
5. If no tuple is found in the input tuple, it returns 0.

mbpp,Mbpp/392,SC-10,1,"To solve the problem, we need to implement a function `get_max_sum(n)` that calculates the maximum sum based on the given equation:

\[ f(n) = \max(f(n/2) + f(n/3) + f(n/4) + f(n/5), n) \]

This means that for a given integer `n`, we can either take the sum of the function evaluated at `n/2`, `n/3`, `n/4`, and `n/5`, or we can take `n` itself, whichever is larger.

To implement this, we can use recursion with memoization to avoid recalculating results for the same inputs multiple times. Here's how we can do it in Python:

```python
def get_max_sum(n, memo=None):
    if memo is None:
        memo = {}
    
    # Base case: if n is 0, the maximum sum is 0
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    
    # Check if the result is already computed
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    
    # Calculate the maximum sum using the given equation
    max_sum = max(get_max_sum(n // 2, memo) +

                   get_max_sum(n // 4, memo) + 
                   get_max_sum(n // 5, memo), n)
    
    # Store the result in the memo dictionary
    memo[n] = max_sum
    return max_sum

# Test the function with the provided assertion
assert get_max_sum(60) == 106
```

### Explanation:
1. **Base Case**: If `n` is 0, the maximum sum is 0.
2. **Memoization**: We use a dictionary `memo` to store already computed results for specific values of `n` to improve efficiency.
3. **Recursive Calculation**: We recursively calculate the maximum sum for `n/2`, `n/3`, `n/4`, and `n/5`, and compare it with `n`.
4. **Return the Result**: The function returns the maximum sum, and we store it in the `memo` dictionary to avoid redundant calculations.

```python

### Explanation:
1. **Length Check**: First, we check if both arrays have the same length. If not, they cannot follow the same pattern.
2. **Mapping Creation**: We use two dictionaries:
   - `pattern_to_value` to map each unique pattern to its corresponding value.
   - `value_to_pattern` to map each unique value back to its corresponding pattern.
3. **Iteration**: We iterate through both arrays simultaneously using `zip()`. For each pair of elements:
   - If the pattern already has a mapped value, we check if it matches the current value. If it doesn't, we return `False`.
   - If the value already has a mapped pattern, we check if it matches the current pattern. If it doesn't, we return `False`.
   - If both checks pass, we add the new mapping to the respective dictionary.
4. **Return True**: If we finish the loop without returning `False`, it means the patterns and values are consistent, and we return `True`.

mbpp,Mbpp/286,SC-10,1,"To solve the problem of finding the largest sum of a contiguous subarray in a modified array formed by repeating the given array `k` times, we can utilize a combination of Kadane's algorithm and some mathematical insights regarding the properties of the array.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Kadane's Algorithm**: This algorithm helps us find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in a single pass through the array.

2. **Handling Repetitions**: When the array is repeated `k` times, we need to consider:
   - The maximum subarray sum within a single instance of the array.
   - The maximum subarray sum that can span across the boundaries of the repeated arrays.

3. **Edge Cases**: If `k` is 1, we simply apply Kadane's algorithm to the original array.

4. **Combining Results**: For `k > 1`, we need to consider:
   - The maximum subarray sum from the original array.
   - The maximum sum that can be formed by taking elements from the start of the first array and the end of the last array, which can be maximized by considering the total sum of the array and the maximum prefix and suffix sums.

Here is the implementation of the above logic:

### Explanation of the Code:
- The `kadane` function computes the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm.
- We calculate the total sum of the array, the maximum prefix sum, and the maximum suffix sum.
- If `k` is greater than 1, we compute the maximum possible sum that can be formed by combining the prefix and suffix sums with the total sum of the array repeated in between.
- Finally, we return the maximum of the computed values.

mbpp,Mbpp/473,SC-10,1,"To find the tuple intersection of elements in the given tuple lists irrespective of their order, we can convert each tuple into a set of its elements. This way, we can easily compare the tuples regardless of the order of their elements. We will then use set operations to find the intersection.

Here's the implementation of the `tuple_intersection` function:

```python
def tuple_intersection(list1, list2):
    # Convert each tuple in the lists to a frozenset to ignore order
    set1 = {frozenset(tup) for tup in list1}
    set2 = {frozenset(tup) for tup in list2}

    intersection = set1.intersection(set2)

1. It converts each tuple in the input lists into a `frozenset`, which allows us to disregard the order of elements in the tuples.
2. It computes the intersection of the two sets of frozensets.
3. Finally, it converts the resulting frozensets back into tuples and returns them as a set.

mbpp,Mbpp/300,SC-10,1,"To solve the problem of counting all binary sequences of length \(2n\) such that the sum of the first \(n\) bits is the same as the sum of the last \(n\) bits, we can use combinatorial mathematics.

The number of valid sequences can be derived from the concept of choosing \(k\) bits to be 1s in the first half and ensuring that the same number of 1s appears in the second half. The total number of ways to choose \(k\) 1s from \(n\) bits is given by the binomial coefficient \(C(n, k)\).

The function can be implemented as follows:

```python
import math

    # Total count of valid sequences
    total_count = 0

### Explanation:
1. **Combinatorial Counting**: For each possible number of 1s \(k\) (from 0 to \(n\)), we calculate the number of ways to choose \(k\) 1s in the first half and \(k\) 1s in the second half. This is done using the binomial coefficient \(C(n, k)\).
2. **Square the Count**: Since the choices for the first half and the second half are independent, we square the count for each \(k\).
3. **Summation**: We sum these counts for all possible values of \(k\) to get the total number of valid sequences.

mbpp,Mbpp/123,SC-10,1,"To solve the problem of summing all amicable numbers from 1 to a specified number, we first need to understand what amicable numbers are. Two numbers are considered amicable if the sum of the proper divisors (excluding the number itself) of the first number equals the second number, and vice versa.

Here's how we can implement the function `amicable_numbers_sum`:

1. Create a helper function to calculate the sum of proper divisors of a number.
2. Iterate through numbers from 1 to the specified number and check for amicable pairs.
3. Keep track of the amicable numbers to avoid counting them multiple times.
4. Sum the unique amicable numbers and return the result.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def sum_of_proper_divisors(n):
    """"""Returns the sum of proper divisors of n.""""""
    if n < 2:
        return 0
    total = 1  # 1 is a proper divisor of any n > 1
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            total += i
            if i != n // i:  # Add the complementary divisor if it's different
                total += n // i
    return total

def amicable_numbers_sum(limit):
    """"""Returns the sum of all amicable numbers from 1 to limit.""""""
    amicable_numbers = set()
    
    for num in range(1, limit + 1):
        if num not in amicable_numbers:  # Check if already counted
            partner = sum_of_proper_divisors(num)
            if partner != num and partner <= limit:
                if sum_of_proper_divisors(partner) == num:
                    amicable_numbers.add(num)
                    amicable_numbers.add(partner)
    
    return sum(amicable_numbers)

# Test the function with the provided assertion
assert amicable_numbers_sum(999) == 504
```

### Explanation:
- The `sum_of_proper_divisors` function calculates the sum of all proper divisors of a given number.
- The `amicable_numbers_sum` function iterates through all numbers up to the specified limit, checks for amicable pairs, and collects them in a set to ensure uniqueness.
- Finally, it returns the sum of all unique amicable numbers found within the specified range.

You can run this code to verify that it correctly computes the sum of amicable numbers up to 999, which should equal 504 as per the assertion.",0.0031004999999999,82.02811574935913,,True,

### Explanation:
- The function `tuple_to_dict` takes a tuple as input.
- It checks if the length of the tuple is even; if not, it raises a `ValueError`.
- It then constructs a dictionary using a dictionary comprehension, iterating over the tuple in steps of 2 to pair adjacent elements as key-value pairs.
