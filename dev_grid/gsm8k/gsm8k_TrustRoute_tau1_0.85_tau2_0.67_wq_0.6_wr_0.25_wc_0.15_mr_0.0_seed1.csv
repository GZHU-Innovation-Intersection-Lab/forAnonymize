gsm8k,gsm8k-0,TrustRoute,1,"To find out how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market from selling her duck eggs, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of eggs laid per day:**  
   Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.

2. **Determine how many eggs she consumes:**  
   Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs for baking muffins.  
   Total eggs consumed = 3 (for breakfast) + 4 (for muffins) = 7 eggs.

3. **Calculate the number of eggs remaining for sale:**  
   Remaining eggs = Total eggs laid - Eggs consumed  
   Remaining eggs = 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

4. **Calculate the revenue from selling the remaining eggs:**  
   Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 per egg.  
   Total revenue = Remaining eggs × Price per egg  
   Total revenue = 9 × 2 = $18.

Let me break down the costs and revenue:

**Initial cost:**
- Planting the tree: $90

**Annual revenue:**
- 7 lemons × $1.5 per lemon = $10.50 per year

**Annual costs:**
- Water and feed: $3 per year

**Net annual profit:**
- $10.50 - $3 = $7.50 per year

**Finding the break-even point:**

I need to find when total earnings exceed total costs:
- Total costs = $90 (initial) + $3 × (number of years)
- Total revenue = $10.50 × (number of years)
- Net profit = Total revenue - Total costs

1.  **At the green house:** She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners.
    Number sold = S/3
    Remaining vacuum cleaners = S - S/3 = 2S/3

2.  **At the red house:** She sold 2 more.
    Remaining vacuum cleaners = (2S/3) - 2

3.  **At the orange house:** She sold half of what was left.
    ""What was left"" refers to the amount after the red house, which is (2S/3) - 2.
    Number sold = [(2S/3) - 2] / 2
    Remaining vacuum cleaners = [(2S/3) - 2] - {[(2S/3) - 2] / 2}
    This simplifies to half of what was left:
    Remaining vacuum cleaners = [(2S/3) - 2] / 2

4.  **Finally:** Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left.
    So, we can set up the equation:
    [(2S/3) - 2] / 2 = 5

Now, let's solve for S:
*   Multiply both sides by 2:
    (2S/3) - 2 = 10
*   Add 2 to both sides:
    2S/3 = 12
*   Multiply both sides by 3:
    2S = 36
*   Divide both sides by 2:
    S = 18

Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

**Check the answer:**
*   Starts with 18.
*   Green house: Sold 1/3 of 18 = 6. Remaining = 18 - 6 = 12.
*   Red house: Sold 2. Remaining = 12 - 2 = 10.

According to the problem, the cost of the two pairs of high heels together is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. We can express this relationship mathematically as:

\[
B = \text{Cost of high heels} + 5
\]

Next, we know the cost of one pair of heels is $33, and the other pair costs twice as much. Therefore, the cost of the second pair of heels is:

\[
2 \times 33 = 66
\]

Now, we can find the total cost of the two pairs of heels:

\[
\text{Cost of high heels} = 33 + 66 = 99
\]

Now we can substitute this value back into the equation we set up earlier:

Calculating this gives:

According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110:
   \[
   S + G = 110
   \]

2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins:
   \[
   G = S + 30
   \]

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation. Replacing \( G \) in the first equation gives us:
\[
S + (S + 30) = 110
\]

Simplifying this, we get:
\[
2S + 30 = 110
\]

Next, we subtract 30 from both sides:
\[

Now, divide both sides by 2:

Now that we have the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:

1. **Pension Amount**: Marcy's full pension after 40 years of service is $50,000 per year.

2. **Entitlement After 20 Years**: After 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the pension value for each year of service beyond 20 years.

3. **Years of Service**: Since Marcy quits after 30 years, she has worked for 10 years beyond the 20-year mark.

Now, let's calculate her entitlement:

- **Years Beyond 20**: 30 years - 20 years = 10 years
- **Percentage of Pension**: 5% per year for 10 years = 10 years * 5% = 50%

This means that after 30 years, Marcy is entitled to 50% of the full pension amount.

### Step 1: Identify the square footage of each level
- The top level (Level 1) has 16 square feet.
- Each level below has twice the square footage of the level above it.
  - Level 2: 2 × 16 = 32 square feet
  - Level 3: 2 × 32 = 64 square feet

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Given Information:**
   - Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
   - Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah.
   - Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David.

2. **Calculate David's laundry:**
   - Sarah does 4 times as much as David.
   - Let D be the amount David does.
   - Then, Sarah's amount = 4 × D.
   - We know Sarah does 400 pounds, so:
     \[
     400 = 4 \times D
     \]
     \[
     D = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
     \]
   - Therefore, David does 100 pounds of laundry.

3. **Calculate Raymond's laundry:**
   - Raymond does half as much as Sarah.
   - Let R be the amount Raymond does.
   - Then, R = \(\frac{1}{2}\) × Sarah's amount.
   - Sarah does 400 pounds, so:
     \[
     R = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 = 200 \text{ pounds}

   - Therefore, Raymond does 200 pounds of laundry.

4. **Find the difference:**

### Step 1: Calculate the cost per flower for each package
- **Package A**: 3 flowers for $2.50  
  Cost per flower = $2.50 ÷ 3 = approximately $0.83 per flower.

- **Package B**: 2 flowers for $1.00  
  Cost per flower = $1.00 ÷ 2 = $0.50 per flower.

From this, Package B is cheaper per flower ($0.50 vs. $0.83).

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost for 18 flowers using each package
- **Using Package A (3 flowers per package)**:  
  Number of packages needed = 18 ÷ 3 = 6 packages.  
  Total cost = 6 packages × $2.50 = $15.00.

- **Using Package B (2 flowers per package)**:  
  Number of packages needed = 18 ÷ 2 = 9 packages.  
  Total cost = 9 packages × $1.00 = $9.00.

### Step 3: Determine the better price and calculate savings
- The better price is Package B, which costs $9.00 for 18 flowers.
- If Vincent buys with Package A instead, it costs $15.00.
- Savings = Cost of Package A - Cost of Package B = $15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00.

Let me set up the problem:
- Total games played = 22
- Let's say they lost L games
- They won W games
- They won 8 more than they lost, so: W = L + 8

Since all games were either won or lost (assuming no ties):
W + L = 22

Now I can substitute W = L + 8 into this equation:
(L + 8) + L = 22
2L + 8 = 22

L = 7

Therefore:
W = L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

3.  **Annual Increase Amount:** The policy states a 10% increase of the *initial salary* every year.

    *   This means an annual increase of $60 * 12 months = $720 per year.
4.  **Sylvie's Timeline:** Sylvie just clocked 5 years last December. This means she *starts* receiving the annual increase from that point onwards. We need her salary after *three more years* of service.

*   **Year 1 (after clocking 5 years):** Her salary will increase by $720.
    *   New Annual Salary = $7200 (initial) + $720 (1st increase) = $7920
*   **Year 2 (after clocking 5 years):** She gets another $720 increase (based on the initial salary).

*   **Year 3 (after clocking 5 years):** She gets another $720 increase.

Henry intended to bake twice as many cookies as last year, so he planned to bake \( 2x \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, leaving him with \( (2x + 15) - 5 \) cookies.

- Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone
- Brittany's phone capacity is 50 times more than the number of ducks in the photograph

**Step 1: Find Brittany's phone capacity**

If Jamal's phone holds 6 times more than Brittany's phone:
- Jamal's capacity = 6 × Brittany's capacity
- 1800 = 6 × Brittany's capacity
- Brittany's capacity = 1800 ÷ 6
- Brittany's capacity = 300 photographs

**Step 2: Find the number of ducks**

If Brittany's phone capacity is 50 times more than the number of ducks:
- Brittany's capacity = 50 × number of ducks
- 300 = 50 × number of ducks
- Number of ducks = 300 ÷ 50
- Number of ducks = 6

gsm8k,gsm8k-116,TrustRoute,1,"To solve the problem, we need to use the given ratio of sugar to water, which is 7:13. This means that for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water.

First, we can find the total number of parts in the ratio:

\[
7 \text{ (sugar)} + 13 \text{ (water)} = 20 \text{ parts}
\]

Next, we know that the total amount of sugar and water combined is 120 teaspoons. We can set up the equation based on the ratio:

Let \( x \) be the multiplier for the ratio. Then:

\[
7x + 13x = 120
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
20x = 120
\]

Now, we can solve for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{120}{20} = 6
\]

Now that we have \( x \), we can find the amount of sugar used:

**Given information:**
- Adrien's salary 4 years ago: $40,000
- Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's (4 years ago)
- Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%
- Both salaries increased simultaneously (by the same percentage)

**Step 1: Find Lylah's salary 4 years ago**

If Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's:
- Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary × 1.30
- $40,000 = Lylah's salary × 1.30
- Lylah's salary = $40,000 ÷ 1.30
- Lylah's salary = $30,769.23 (approximately)

**Step 2: Find Adrien's salary four years later**

Adrien's salary increased by 40%:
- New salary = $40,000 × 1.40
- New salary = $56,000

**Step 3: Find the percentage increase**

Since both salaries increased simultaneously (by the same percentage):
- Percentage increase = 40%

**Step 4: Find Lylah's salary four years later**

Lylah's salary also increased by 40%:
- New salary = $30,769.23 × 1.40
- New salary = $43,076.92 (approximately)

**Step 5: Calculate total salary four years later**

Total = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
Total = $56,000 + $43,076.92
Total = $99,076.92

**Answer: $99,076.92** (or approximately $99,077)

Alternatively, using exact fractions:
- Lylah's old salary = $40,000/1.3 = $400,000/13
- Lylah's new salary = ($400,000/13) × 1.4 = $560,000/13
- Total = $56,000 + $560,000/13 = $728,000/13 + $560,000/13 = $1,288,000/13 ≈ **$99,076.92**",0.01492825,21.361350297927856,0,0,cand-claude-sonnet-4-5,stage2_confidence,

### Step 1: Calculate the hours per week
- **Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays**: Kimo has 3 classes per day, and each class is 1 hour long.
  - Hours per day: 3 classes × 1 hour/class = 3 hours
  - There are 3 such days (Monday, Wednesday, Friday), so: 3 days × 3 hours/day = 9 hours
- **Tuesdays and Thursdays**: Kimo has 2 classes per day, and each class is 2 hours long.

### Step 1: Calculate the total length of each type of baked good.
- **Rolls**: There are 300 rolls, and each is 4 inches long.  
  Total length of rolls = 300 × 4 inches = 1,200 inches.

- **Chocolate croissants**: There are 120 croissants, and each is 6 inches long.  
  Total length of croissants = 120 × 6 inches = 720 inches.

- **Baguettes**: There are 60 baguettes, and each is 2 feet long.  
  Total length of baguettes = 60 × 2 feet = 120 feet.

### Step 2: Convert all lengths to the same unit (feet) for addition.
- We know that 1 foot = 12 inches.  
- Convert the rolls' length: 1,200 inches ÷ 12 = 100 feet.  
- Convert the croissants' length: 720 inches ÷ 12 = 60 feet.  
- The baguettes are already in feet: 120 feet.

### Step 3: Add up the lengths.
- Total length = Length of rolls + Length of croissants + Length of baguettes

Subtracting 4 from both sides gives:
\[
S + B = 24
\]

Now we have a system of equations:
1. \( S = 2B \)
2. \( S + B = 24 \)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation. Replacing \( S \) with \( 2B \) in the second equation gives:
\[
2B + B = 24

This simplifies to:
\[
3B = 24

Dividing both sides by 3:
\[

   - Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage.
   - There are 3 cages of rats, so the total number of rats is \( 3r \).
   - Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, so the total straw used for rats is:
     \[
     \text{Straw for rats} = 3r \times 6 = 18r
     \]

2. **Calculate the straw used for hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
   - Let \( h \) be the number of hamsters in each cage.
   - The total number of hamsters is \( 10h \).
   - The total straw used for hamsters is:
     \[
     \text{Straw for hamsters} = 10h \times 5 = 50h
     \]

3. **Calculate the straw used for rabbits:**
   - The problem states that 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

4. **Set up the equation for total straw distributed:**
   - The total straw distributed among all rodents is given as 160 pieces. Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     18r + 50h + 20 = 160
     \]

5. **Simplify the equation:**
   - Subtract 20 from both sides:
     \[
     18r + 50h = 140
     \]

6. **Solve for \( r \) and \( h \):**
   - Rearranging gives:
     \[
     18r = 140 - 50h
     \]
   - This means \( r \) can be expressed as:
     \[
     r = \frac{140 - 50h}{18}
     \]

7. **Find integer solutions for \( r \) and \( h \):**
   - Since \( r \) must be a whole number, \( 140 - 50h \) must be divisible by 18. We can test integer values for \( h \) to find valid \( r \).

   - **Testing \( h = 0 \):**
     \[
     r = \frac{140 - 50 \times 0}{18} = \frac{140}{18} \approx 7.78 \quad (\text{not an integer})
     \]

   - **Testing \( h = 1 \):**
     \[
     r = \frac{140 - 50 \times 1}{18} = \frac{90}{18} = 5 \quad (\text{integer})
     \]

   - **Testing \( h = 2 \):**
     \[
     r = \frac{140 - 50 \times 2}{18} = \frac{40}{18} \approx 2.22 \quad (\text{not an integer})

- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n months, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (as a decimal).

1. **Cost of tickets**: The friends spent $20.25 on 3 tickets.

2. **Cost of food**: They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. 
   \[
   \text{Cost of food} = \text{Cost of tickets} - 4.50 = 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75
   \]

3. **Cost of rides**: They went on 2 rides, and each ride costs $33.
   \[
   \text{Cost of rides} = 2 \times 33 = 66

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.

2. **Net growth of trees per year**:
   - Trees planted per year: 10
   - Trees chopped down per year: 2
   - Net increase in trees per year = Trees planted - Trees chopped down = 10 - 2 = 8 trees.

3. **Total trees after 10 years before considering deaths**:
   - In 10 years, the net increase = 8 trees/year * 10 years = 80 trees.
   - Total trees after 10 years = Initial trees + Net increase = 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

4. **Calculating the effect of tree deaths**:
   - After 10 years, 30% of the trees die.
   - Number of trees that die = 30% of 130 = 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees.

5. **Total trees left after deaths**:

1. **Initial Flamingos**: On Friday morning, Sue has 18 pink plastic flamingos in her yard.

2. **Saturday's Changes**:
   - The neighbors take back one third of the flamingos. 
   - One third of 18 is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6
     \]
   - So, 6 flamingos are taken back and painted white. 
   - After this, the number of pink flamingos left is:
     \[
     18 - 6 = 12
     \]
   - Now, there are 6 white flamingos added back to the yard.

3. **Sunday's Changes**: 
   - On Sunday morning, the neighbors add another 18 pink flamingos to the collection.
   - The total number of pink flamingos now is:

4. **Final Count**:
   - At noon on Sunday, there are 30 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

1. **Determine the payment from Publisher A:**
   - Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers.
   - He edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, so he edits \( \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \) sentences for Publisher A.
   - Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence.
   - Therefore, the total payment from Publisher A is:
