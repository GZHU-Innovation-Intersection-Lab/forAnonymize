gsm8k,gsm8k-205,SC-5,1,"To find out what score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after dropping the lowest score, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total score needed for an average of 93**: Since the lowest score will be dropped, we will consider only the top five scores for the average calculation. To find the total score needed for an average of 93 over five tests, we use the formula:

   \[
   \text{Total needed} = \text{Average} \times \text{Number of tests}
   \]

   Here, the average is 93 and the number of tests is 5:

   \[
   \text{Total needed} = 93 \times 5 = 465
   \]

2. **Calculate the sum of the first five test scores**: Brinley's scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. We first calculate the sum of these scores:

   \[
   \text{Sum of scores} = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438
   \]

3. **Determine the score needed on the sixth test**: Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test. After dropping the lowest score, we want the sum of the highest five scores to equal 465. The lowest score among the first five is 71, so we can drop it. Therefore, we need:

   \[
   438 + x - 71 = 465
   \]

   Simplifying this equation:

   \[
   438 + x - 71 = 465

1. **Weight of the chocolate bars:**
   - Joe has 25 chocolate bars.
   - Each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams.
   - Total weight of chocolate bars = Number of chocolate bars × Weight of each chocolate bar
   \[
   \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ grams}
   \]

2. **Weight of the candied apples:**
   - We know that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams, each candied apple weighs:
   \[
   \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ grams}

Next, we need to determine how much money Sara has after babysitting and how much more she needs to earn by mowing the lawn.

1. **Earnings from babysitting**: She babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings from babysitting} = 4 \times 5 = 20
   \]

2. **Total money Sara has before mowing the lawn**: She starts with $10 saved and adds her babysitting earnings:

gsm8k,gsm8k-211,SC-5,1,"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, so the total egg production from red chickens is \( 3r \).
2. The white chickens produce 5 eggs a day, so the total egg production from white chickens is \( 5w \).
3. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs every day, which gives us the equation:
   \[
   3r + 5w = 42
   \]
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which gives us the equation:
   \[
   w = r + 2
   \]

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation. Replacing \( w \) in the first equation, we get:
\[
3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
\]

Now, simplify this equation:
\[
3r + 5r + 10 = 42
\]
\[
8r + 10 = 42
\]

Next, subtract 10 from both sides:
\[
8r = 32

Now, divide by 8:
\[
r = 4
\]

Now that we have the number of red chickens, we can find the number of white chickens using the equation \( w = r + 2 \):
\[
w = 4 + 2 = 6

Thus, Jerry has:
- Red chickens: \( r = 4 \)
- White chickens: \( w = 6 \)

To verify, we can check the total egg production:
- From red chickens: \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) eggs
- From white chickens: \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \) eggs
- Total: \( 12 + 30 = 42 \) eggs, which matches the given information.

- Naomi's score: \( N = 68 \)
- Yuri's score: \( Y \)
- Brianna's score: \( B \)
- Jojo's score: \( J \)

From the problem, we know:

1. The total score of all students is 251 points:
   \[
   N + Y + B + J = 251
   \]

2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi:
   \[
   Y = \frac{N}{2} + 10
   \]

3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi:
   \[
   B = N + 17
   \]

Now, we can substitute \( N \) into the equations for \( Y \) and \( B \):

1. Substitute \( N = 68 \) into the equation for \( Y \):
   \[
   Y = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]

2. Substitute \( N = 68 \) into the equation for \( B \):
   \[
   B = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]

Now we have the scores for Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
- \( N = 68 \)
- \( Y = 44 \)
- \( B = 85 \)

Next, we can substitute these values into the total score equation to find Jojo's score \( J \):
\[
68 + 44 + 85 + J = 251
\]

Calculating the sum of Naomi's, Yuri's, and Brianna's scores:
\[
68 + 44 = 112
\]
\[
112 + 85 = 197
\]

Now, substituting back into the total score equation:
\[
197 + J = 251

To find \( J \), we subtract 197 from 251:
\[
J = 251 - 197 = 54

4. **Avocado**: $1.00
5. **Sauces**: 2 sauces at $0.25 each = 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
6. **Upgrade for chips and drink**: $3.00

Now, we can add all these costs together:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 6.50 + 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 + 3.00

gsm8k,gsm8k-242,SC-5,1,"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing letters each week, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of pen pals he is still corresponding with:**
   - Mike originally had 5 pen pals.
   - He stopped being pen pals with 2 of them.
   - Therefore, he currently has \(5 - 2 = 3\) pen pals.

2. **Calculate the total number of letters sent per week:**
   - Each of the 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week.
   - Total letters sent to Mike per week = \(3 \text{ pen pals} \times 2 \text{ letters} = 6 \text{ letters}\).

3. **Calculate the total number of pages he receives per week:**
   - Each letter is 5 pages long.
   - Total pages received per week = \(6 \text{ letters} \times 5 \text{ pages} = 30 \text{ pages}\).

4. **Determine the total number of pages Mike writes in response:**
   - Mike responds in kind, meaning he writes the same number of pages he receives.
   - Therefore, he writes 30 pages in response each week.

5. **Calculate the time it takes Mike to write these pages:**
   - Mike can write 1 page every 6 minutes.
   - Total time to write 30 pages = \(30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes}\).

6. **Convert minutes into hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Total hours spent writing = \(\frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}\).

Thus, Mike spends **3 hours** writing letters each week.",0.00123315,33.353798151016235,0,0,gpt-4o-mini,,,1

Next, we can find Andrea's bananas using the second equation:
\[
B_A = \frac{1}{2} B_J = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24

   \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
   \[
   R + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

\[
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
\]

Expanding the right side:

\[
6S + 9 = 3S + 27
\]

Now, we can isolate \( S \) by subtracting \( 3S \) from both sides:

\[
6S - 3S + 9 = 27
\]
\[
3S + 9 = 27

Next, subtract 9 from both sides:

S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 200
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
90 + S_2 + 45 = 200
\]

Now, simplify the equation:

\[
S_2 + 135 = 200
\]
\[
S_2 = 200 - 135 = 65
\]

So, Elise sold 65 books in the second year.

Next, we calculate the total amount of money she earned in the second year. Each book sells for $20, so:

\[
\text{Earnings in Second Year} = S_2 \times \text{Price per Book} = 65 \times 20
\]

Calculating that:

\[
\text{Earnings in Second Year} = 1300

1. **Calculate weekly earnings without the bonus:**
   - Watson works 10 hours a day for 5 days a week.
   - Total hours worked in a week = 10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week.
   - His hourly wage is $10.
   - Weekly earnings (without bonus) = 50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week.

2. **Add the weekly bonus:**
   - Watson receives a $300 bonus each week.
   - Total weekly earnings with bonus = $500 (earnings) + $300 (bonus) = $800/week.

3. **Calculate the number of weeks in April:**
   - April has 30 days.
   - There are 4 full weeks in April (28 days) and 2 extra days.
   - Since Watson works 5 days a week, he will work 5 days in the first 4 weeks, which totals 20 days.

   - At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old six years ago.
   - Therefore, Noah's current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

2. **Calculate the population of Chile six years ago**:
   - We are given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.

gsm8k,gsm8k-314,SC-5,1,"Let the number of players on the defense be \( d \).

According to the problem:

1. The number of players on the offense is \( 2d \) (twice as many as on defense).
2. The number of players on special teams is \( \frac{d}{2} \) (half the number of players on defense).

The total number of members in the team is given as 105. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
d + 2d + \frac{d}{2} = 105
\]

Now, let's simplify the equation:

\[
d + 2d = 3d
\]

So we can rewrite the equation as:

\[
3d + \frac{d}{2} = 105
\]

To combine the terms, we can express \( 3d \) as a fraction with a common denominator:

\[
3d = \frac{6d}{2}
\]

Now, substituting this back into the equation gives:

\[
\frac{6d}{2} + \frac{d}{2} = 105
\]

Combining the fractions:

\[
\frac{6d + d}{2} = 105
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{7d}{2} = 105
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 2:

\[
7d = 210
\]

Now, divide both sides by 7:

\[
d = 30
\]

Thus, the number of players on the defense is \( \boxed{30} \). 

To verify, we can calculate the number of players on offense and special teams:

- Offense: \( 2d = 2 \times 30 = 60 \)
- Special teams: \( \frac{d}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \)

Now, adding these together:

   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, the total weakening from the ice cubes is:
     \[
     \text{Weakening from ice cubes} = \text{Number of ice cubes} \times \text{Weakening per ice cube} = 5 \times 12 \text{ ml} = 60 \text{ ml}
     \]

2. **Adding Cream**:
   - Adding 15 milliliters of cream also weakens the coffee. Since the problem states that any added liquid weakens the coffee, we will add this directly to the weakening caused by the ice cubes.
   - Therefore, the total weakening from the cream is:
     \[
     \text{Weakening from cream} = 15 \text{ ml}
     \]

3. **Total Weakening**:
   - Now we can calculate the total weakening of the iced coffee:
     \[
     \text{Total weakening} = \text{Weakening from ice cubes} + \text{Weakening from cream} = 60 \text{ ml} + 15 \text{ ml} = 75 \text{ ml}

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is **75 milliliters weaker** after cooling it by 65 degrees and adding 15 milliliters of cream.",0.0013989,37.00885581970215,0,0,gpt-4o-mini,,,0

- The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is \( 4x - 5 \).
- The number of customers kicked out for physical violence is \( 3 \) times the number of shoplifters.

Now, let's calculate the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting:

\[

   - Since he has the bracelet, he can ride all 9 rides without any additional cost.

   Total cost for David = $30.

2. **Cost for Dasha (who buys tickets)**:
   - Each ride costs 2 ride tickets.
   - The cost of each ticket is $2.
   - Therefore, the cost for one ride in tickets is:
     \[
     2 \text{ tickets} \times 2 \text{ dollars/ticket} = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - For 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is:
     \[
     9 \text{ rides} \times 4 \text{ dollars/ride} = 36 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculating the savings**:
   - Now, we find out how much money David saves compared to Dasha:
   \[
   \text{Savings} = \text{Cost for Dasha} - \text{Cost for David} = 36 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars}

gsm8k,gsm8k-391,SC-5,1,"To solve the problem, we can start by letting the number of popsicles that Betty has be represented as \( 5x \) and the number of popsicles that Sam has be represented as \( 6x \), where \( x \) is a common multiplier.

According to the problem, the total number of popsicles they have together is 165. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
5x + 6x = 165
\]

Combining the terms on the left side gives us:

\[
11x = 165
\]

Next, we can solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 11:

\[
x = \frac{165}{11} = 15
\]

Now that we have the value of \( x \), we can find the number of popsicles each person has:

- Betty's popsicles: 
\[
5x = 5 \times 15 = 75
\]

- Sam's popsicles: 
\[
6x = 6 \times 15 = 90
\]

Now, to find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number Sam has:

\[
90 - 75 = 15

Thus, Sam has **15 more popsicles** than Betty.",0.0009365999999999,28.70958685874939,0,0,gpt-4o-mini,,,1
gsm8k,gsm8k-392,SC-5,1,"To find out how much Tim saves by cancelling his cable subscription, we first need to calculate the total cost of his new streaming services and then compare it to the cost of his cable package.

1. **Cost of Streaming Services:**
   - Netflix: $10 per month
   - Hulu: $10 per month
   - Disney Plus: $10 per month

   Normally, the total cost without bundling would be:
   \[
   \text{Total without bundling} = \text{Netflix} + \text{Hulu} + \text{Disney Plus} = 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   Since Tim saves 20% by bundling Hulu and Disney Plus, we need to calculate the bundled price:
   - The combined cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $20 (i.e., $10 + $10).
   - The savings from bundling is:
   \[
   \text{Savings} = 20\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   - Therefore, the bundled cost is:
   \[
   \text{Bundled cost} = 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   Now, adding Netflix to the bundled cost:
   \[
   \text{Total cost of streaming services} = \text{Netflix} + \text{Bundled Hulu and Disney Plus} = 10 + 16 = 26 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of Cable Subscription:**
   - Cable package: $60 per month

3. **Calculating Savings:**
   To find out how much Tim saves by cancelling his cable subscription, we subtract the total cost of streaming services from the cost of the cable package:
   \[
   \text{Savings} = \text{Cost of cable} - \text{Total cost of streaming services} = 60 - 26 = 34 \text{ dollars}

1. **Calculate the total payment for May:**
   - Number of employees hired in May: 40
   - Hourly wage per employee: $15
   - Hours worked per week: 40

   The total payment for May can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total payment for May} = \text{Number of employees} \times \text{Hourly wage} \times \text{Hours worked}

According to the problem:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- She gathers half of that from the shortest trees, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
- Therefore, the total number of apples Joanne gathers is:
  \[
  30 + 15 + x = 45 + x
  \]

Now, let's analyze how many apples her sister gathers:

- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- She gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- Her sister does not gather any apples from the average trees.

Thus, the total number of apples her sister gathers is:

We know the following:

1. Each camel has 2 humps, and each dromedary has 1 hump.
2. The total number of heads (which is the total number of camels and dromedaries) is 180.
3. The total number of humps is 304.

From this information, we can set up the following equations:

1. The equation for the total number of heads:
   \[
   C + D = 180
   \]

2. The equation for the total number of humps:
   \[
   2C + D = 304
   \]

Now we can solve these equations step by step.

First, we can solve the first equation for \( C \):
\[
C = 180 - D
\]

Next, we can substitute this expression for \( C \) into the second equation:
\[
2(180 - D) + D = 304
\]

Expanding this gives:
\[
360 - 2D + D = 304

Combining like terms results in:
\[

Now, we can isolate \( D \):
\[
-D = 304 - 360
\]
\[
-D = -56
\]
\[
D = 56
\]

Now that we have \( D \), we can find \( C \):

2. **Next 2 days**: 
   - He traveled a total of 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days.
   - 30% of 800 kilometers = 0.30 * 800 km = 240 kilometers.
   - Since this distance is over 2 days, we can assume he traveled 240 km in total over these 2 days.

3. **Next day (Day 7)**: 
   - Tom did not travel at all, so the distance for this day = 0 kilometers.

4. **Second week (Days 8 to 14)**:

1. **Initial Preparation**: The caterer was told to prepare gourmet hot dogs for 36 guests. He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs. 

   - Half of 36 guests = 36 / 2 = 18 guests.
   - If 18 guests are to have two hotdogs each, the total number of hotdogs prepared = 18 guests × 2 hotdogs/guest = 36 hotdogs.

1. **Calculate the original cost per balloon:**
   The total cost for filling 20 balloons was $900. Therefore, the cost per balloon can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of balloons}} = \frac{900}{20} = 45
   \]

   So, the original cost per balloon was $45.

2. **Determine the new cost per balloon after the price increase:**
   The cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. Thus, the new cost per balloon is:

   \[
   \text{New cost per balloon} = \text{Original cost per balloon} + 20 = 45 + 20 = 65

From the problem, we have the following equations:

1. \( L + D + B = 43 \) (the total number of insects)
2. \( L = D + 7 \) (Lily found 7 more than David)
3. \( D = \frac{1}{2} B \) (David found half of what Bodhi found)

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( L \) and \( D \) into the first equation.

First, substitute \( D \) from equation 3 into equation 2:

\[
L = \frac{1}{2}B + 7
\]

Now substitute \( L \) and \( D \) into equation 1:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}B + 7\right) + \left(\frac{1}{2}B\right) + B = 43

1. **Cost and Production Analysis**:
   - A **2 x 4** costs **$4** and produces **200 sticks**.
   - A **2 x 8** costs **$6** and produces **400 sticks**.

2. **Sticks per Dollar Calculation**:
   - For a **2 x 4**: 
     \[
     \text{Sticks per dollar} = \frac{200 \text{ sticks}}{4 \text{ dollars}} = 50 \text{ sticks per dollar}
     \]
   - For a **2 x 8**: 
     \[
     \text{Sticks per dollar} = \frac{400 \text{ sticks}}{6 \text{ dollars}} \approx 66.67 \text{ sticks per dollar}
     \]

From this calculation, we see that the **2 x 8** provides more sticks per dollar.

3. **Maximizing Sticks with $24**:
   - If Frederick buys only **2 x 8** pieces:
     \[
     \text{Number of 2 x 8 pieces he can buy} = \frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{6 \text{ dollars per piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total sticks from 4 pieces} = 4 \times 400 = 1600 \text{ sticks}
     \]

   - If Frederick buys only **2 x 4** pieces:
     \[
     \text{Number of 2 x 4 pieces he can buy} = \frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars per piece}} = 6 \text{ pieces}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total sticks from 6 pieces} = 6 \times 200 = 1200 \text{ sticks}
     \]

4. **Combining Both Types**:
   - Let's consider a combination of both types. Let \( x \) be the number of **2 x 4** pieces and \( y \) be the number of **2 x 8** pieces. The constraints are:
     \[
     4x + 6y \leq 24
     \]
   - The total number of sticks produced is:
     \[
     \text{Total sticks} = 200x + 400y

   We can check a few combinations:
   - If \( y = 3 \) (3 pieces of **2 x 8**):
     \[
     4x + 6(3) \leq 24 \implies 4x + 18 \leq 24 \implies 4x \leq 6 \implies x \leq 1.5 \implies x = 1
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total sticks} = 200(1) + 400(3) = 200 + 1200 = 1400 \text{ sticks}
     \]

   - If \( y = 2 \) (2 pieces of **2 x 8**):
     \[
     4x + 6(2) \leq 24 \implies 4x + 12 \leq 24 \implies 4x \leq 12 \implies x \leq 3
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total sticks} = 200(3) + 400(2) = 600 + 800 = 1400 \text{ sticks}
     \]

   - If \( y = 1 \) (1 piece of **2 x 8**):
     \[
     4x + 6(1) \leq 24 \implies 4x + 6 \leq 24 \implies 4x \leq 18 \implies x \leq 4.5 \implies x = 4

     \[
     \text{Total sticks} = 200(4) + 400(1) = 800 + 400 = 1200 \text{ sticks}

1. **Cost of the computer**: Errol bought a computer for $1,100.

2. **Cost of the printer**: The printer cost $400 less than the computer. Therefore, the cost of the printer is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of printer} = \text{Cost of computer} - 400 = 1,100 - 400 = 700
   \]

3. **Total cost of the computer, monitors, and printer**: The total cost of all items is $2,400. We can express this as:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of computer} + \text{Cost of 2 monitors} + \text{Cost of printer}
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   2,400 = 1,100 + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} + 700
   \]

4. **Combine the known costs**:
   \[
   2,400 = 1,100 + 700 + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor}
   \]
   \[
   2,400 = 1,800 + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor}
   \]

5. **Isolate the cost of the monitors**:
   \[
   2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} = 2,400 - 1,800
   \]
   \[
   2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} = 600

2. **Shells Collected by Boys**: Each boy brought back 60 shells. Since there are 10 boys, the total number of shells brought back by the boys is:
   \[
   \text{Total shells by boys} = 10 \text{ boys} \times 60 \text{ shells/boy} = 600 \text{ shells}
   \]

3. **Shells Collected by Girls**: According to the problem, the number of shells brought back by the girls is equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. 

   First, we calculate four times the total shells brought by the boys:
   \[
   4 \times 600 \text{ shells} = 2400 \text{ shells}

gsm8k,gsm8k-554,SC-5,1,"To solve the problem, we first need to determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in both cold and warm water.

1. **Cold Water**: 
   - Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.

2. **Warm Water**: 
   - The time taken to swim a mile in warm water is 2 minutes more than twice the time taken in cold water.
   - Twice the time in cold water: \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes.
   - Adding 2 minutes: \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes.
   - Therefore, Ray swims a mile in warm water in 34 minutes.

Now, we calculate the time taken to swim 3 miles in both conditions:

3. **Cold Water (3 miles)**:
   - Time = \(3 \times 16 = 48\) minutes.

4. **Warm Water (3 miles)**:

Since Kate has 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we can calculate the total number of crayons:

\[
3 \text{ boxes} \times 64 \text{ crayons/box} = 192 \text{ crayons}
\]

Next, we assume that each crayon can be broken down into small pieces. If we consider that each crayon can be melted down into 8 small pieces, we can calculate the total number of small pieces:

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

1. Distribute the 2 on the right side:
   \[
   x = 2x - 10
   \]

2. Rearrange the equation to isolate \( x \):
   \[
   x - 2x = -10
   \]
   \[
   -x = -10
   \]
   \[
   x = 10

- One angle is twice the smallest angle: \( 2x \)
- One angle is three times the smallest angle: \( 3x \)

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

gsm8k,gsm8k-611,SC-5,1,"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we can break it down into two parts: the initial funding for the first 5 months and the funding for the additional months.

1. **Initial Funding for the First 5 Months:**
   - John received $100,000 for the first 5 months.
   - Therefore, the cost for the first 5 months is:
     \[
     \text{Cost for first 5 months} = \$100,000
     \]

2. **Duration of Research:**
   - The research took 10 times longer than the initial 5 months:
     \[
     \text{Total duration} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ months}
     \]
   - This means there are \(50 - 5 = 45\) additional months after the initial funding.

3. **Funding for the Additional Months:**
   - The funding for each of the additional months increases by 50% compared to the previous month.
   - The funding for the 6th month (the first additional month) can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Funding for month 6} = \frac{\$100,000}{5} \times 1.5 = \$30,000
     \]
   - The funding for each subsequent month increases by 50% of the previous month's funding. Thus, we can calculate the funding for each month as follows:
     - Month 7: \(30,000 \times 1.5 = 45,000\)
     - Month 8: \(45,000 \times 1.5 = 67,500\)
     - Month 9: \(67,500 \times 1.5 = 101,250\)
     - Month 10: \(101,250 \times 1.5 = 151,875\)
     - And so on...

   This forms a geometric series where the first term \(a = 30,000\) and the common ratio \(r = 1.5\).

4. **Total Cost for the Additional Months:**
   - The total cost for the additional 45 months can be calculated using the formula for the sum of a geometric series:
     \[
     S_n = a \frac{(r^n - 1)}{(r - 1)}
     \]
   - Here, \(n = 45\), \(a = 30,000\), and \(r = 1.5\):
     \[
     S_{45} = 30,000 \frac{(1.5^{45} - 1)}{(1.5 - 1)}
     \]

5. **Calculating \(1.5^{45}\):**
   - Using a calculator, we find:
     \[
     1.5^{45} \approx 11222.741
     \]

6. **Calculating the Total Cost:**
   - Now substituting back into the sum formula:
     \[
     S_{45} = 30,000 \frac{(11222.741 - 1)}{0.5} \approx 30,000 \times 22445.482 = 673364460

Now, we can solve for \( x \):

1. Multiply both sides by \( x \) (assuming \( x > 0 \)):

2. Divide both sides by 10:
   \[

gsm8k,gsm8k-639,SC-5,1,"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole in cubic feet. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) can be calculated using the formula:

\[
V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}
\]

Given:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

Now, substituting the values into the formula:

\[
V = 6 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} \times 3 \, \text{ft} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet}
\]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) to dig the entire hole can be calculated by multiplying the volume by the time per cubic foot:

\[
T = V \times \text{time per cubic foot}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds/cubic foot} = 216 \, \text{seconds}

1. **Base price of the truck**: $30,000

2. **Cost of the king cab upgrade**: $7,500

3. **Cost of leather seats**: 
   - Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade.
   - Cost of leather seats = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 7,500 = 2,500 \)

4. **Cost of running boards**: 
   - Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats.
   - Cost of running boards = \( 2,500 - 500 = 2,000 \)

1. **Cost of the plane**: 
   - The plane costs $150,000.

2. **Monthly expenses**:
   - Hanger rental: $5,000 per month.
   - Fuel cost: Twice the hanger rental, which is \(2 \times 5,000 = 10,000\) per month.

3. **Total monthly expenses**:

gsm8k,gsm8k-660,SC-5,1,"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let:
- \( s \) = number of sheep
- \( g \) = number of geese

We know the following:
1. Each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs. The total number of legs is 70.
2. Each animal has 1 head. The total number of heads is 20.

From this information, we can create the following equations:

1. For the total number of legs:
   \[
   4s + 2g = 70
   \]

2. For the total number of heads:
   \[
   s + g = 20
   \]

Now we can solve this system of equations.

First, we can solve the second equation for \( g \):
\[
g = 20 - s
\]

Next, we substitute \( g \) in the first equation:
\[
4s + 2(20 - s) = 70
\]

Expanding this gives:
\[
4s + 40 - 2s = 70
\]

Combining like terms:
\[
2s + 40 = 70
\]

Subtracting 40 from both sides:
\[
2s = 30
\]

Dividing by 2:
\[
s = 15
\]

Now that we have the number of sheep, we can find the number of geese by substituting \( s \) back into the equation for \( g \):
\[
g = 20 - 15 = 5
\]

Thus, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( \boxed{15} \).",0.0011822999999999,26.12378025054932,0,0,gpt-4o-mini,,,1

- Let \( S \) be the number of cookies Summer has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. \( K = M - 5 \) (Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max)
2. \( M = C + 12 \) (Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster)
3. \( S = M + 23 \) (Summer has 23 more cookies than Max)
4. \( K = 68 \) (Katarina has 68 cookies)

Now, we can substitute \( K \) into the first equation to find \( M \):

\[
68 = M - 5
\]
\[
M = 68 + 5 = 73

4. **Time to Mow Half the Lawn in Turtle Mode**:
   To find the time taken to mow half the lawn in turtle mode:
   \[

First, let's see how many scoops Erin can buy without considering the deal:

\[
\text{Number of scoops without deal} = \frac{\text{Total money}}{\text{Cost per scoop}} = \frac{6.00}{1.50} = 4 \text{ scoops}
\]

Now, let's apply the deal:

- For every 2 scoops Erin buys, she gets 1 additional scoop for free. This means:
  - If she buys 2 scoops, she pays for 2 scoops and gets 1 free, totaling 3 scoops.
  - If she buys another 2 scoops, she pays for 2 more and gets another free scoop, totaling another 3 scoops.

Now, let's calculate how many scoops she can get with her budget:

1. **Buying 2 scoops**: 
   - Cost = 2 scoops × $1.50/scoop = $3.00
   - Total scoops = 3 (2 bought + 1 free)

2. **Remaining money**: 
   - After buying 2 scoops, Erin has $6.00 - $3.00 = $3.00 left.

3. **Buying another 2 scoops**: 
   - Cost = 2 scoops × $1.50/scoop = $3.00
   - Total scoops = 3 (2 bought + 1 free)

Now, Erin has spent all her money:

- Total scoops from the first purchase = 3
- Total scoops from the second purchase = 3

Adding these together:

Topher's shoe length is 8 feet and 4 inches. We can convert this to inches as follows:

1. Convert feet to inches:
   - 1 foot = 12 inches
   - 8 feet = 8 × 12 = 96 inches

2. Add the remaining inches:
   - Total length in inches = 96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

Now we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches.

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby’s shoes. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

Let \( b \) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches.

The equation based on the problem statement is:
\[
100 = 9b + 10
\]

Now, we can solve for \( b \):

1. Subtract 10 from both sides:

From the problem, we have the following information:

- Total number of students: \( 50 \)
- Students who like to bake: \( B = 10 \)
- Students who like to play basketball: \( BB = 5 \)
- The number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball: \( M = 2 \times BB = 2 \times 5 = 10 \)

Now, we can set up the equation for the total number of students:

According to the problem, two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Therefore, the number of Pomeranian puppies is:

Next, we know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls. Thus, the number of Pomeranian girls is:

\[

gsm8k,gsm8k-763,SC-5,1,"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \), for the second house as \( y \), and for the third house as \( z \).

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The first house needs half of the second house:
   \[
   x = \frac{1}{2}y
   \]

2. The third house needs double the first house:
   \[
   z = 2x
   \]

3. The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250:
   \[
   x + y + z = 250
   \]

Now, we can substitute \( x \) and \( z \) in terms of \( y \) into the total equation.

From the first equation, we can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
\[
y = 2x
\]

Now substitute \( y \) into the total equation:
\[
x + 2x + z = 250
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
3x + z = 250
\]

Now substitute \( z \) from the second equation:
\[
3x + 2x = 250
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
5x = 250
\]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{250}{5} = 50

Now that we have \( x \), we can find \( y \) and \( z \):
1. Calculate \( y \):
   \[
   y = 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100

1. **Driving Speed and Time**:
   - The average driving speed is 50 miles per hour.
   - The total time for the trip is 6 hours.
   - The time spent hiking is 1.5 hours.
   - Therefore, the time spent driving is:
     \[
     \text{Driving time} = \text{Total time} - \text{Hiking time} = 6 \text{ hours} - 1.5 \text{ hours} = 4.5 \text{ hours}

2. **Distance Driven**:
   - The distance driven can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
     \]
   - So, the distance driven is:
     \[
     \text{Distance driven} = 50 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4.5 \text{ hours} = 225 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Hiking Speed**:
   - The hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half of their driving speed.
   - Half of the driving speed is:
     \[

Let:
- \( e \) = the number of enemies Emma jumps on
- \( b \) = the number of berries Emma collects
- \( t \) = the time (in seconds) Emma has left when she finishes the level

From the problem, we know:
- Ava jumps on \( e + 8 \) enemies.
- Ava collects \( b + 3 \) berries.
- Ava finishes 4 seconds slower, so she has \( t - 4 \) seconds left.

Now we can calculate their scores:

**Emma's score:**
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Emma}} = 10e + 5b + 30t
\]

**Ava's score:**
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10(e + 8) + 5(b + 3) + 30(t - 4)

Now, let's expand Ava's score:
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10e + 80 + 5b + 15 + 30t - 120
\]
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10e + 5b + 30t - 25
\]

Now we can find the difference between Ava's and Emma's scores:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} - \text{Score}_{\text{Emma}}
\]
Substituting the scores:
\[
\text{Difference} = (10e + 5b + 30t - 25) - (10e + 5b + 30t)

gsm8k,gsm8k-783,SC-5,1,"Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \( x \) and the number of white fish he bought as \( y \).

Initially, Bob had:
- 3 orange fish
- 4 white fish

After buying the fish, the total number of orange fish becomes \( 3 + x \) and the total number of white fish becomes \( 4 + y \).

According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob found that he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[
3 + x = 2(4 + y)
\]

We also know that Bob bought a total of 17 fish, so:

\[
x + y = 17
\]

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. \( 3 + x = 2(4 + y) \)
2. \( x + y = 17 \)

Let's solve the first equation:

\[
3 + x = 8 + 2y
\]
\[
x - 2y = 5 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]

Now, we can rearrange the second equation:

\[
x = 17 - y \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\]

Now, substitute Equation 2 into Equation 1:

\[
(17 - y) - 2y = 5
\]
\[
17 - 3y = 5
\]
\[
-3y = 5 - 17
\]
\[
-3y = -12
\]
\[
y = 4
\]

Now that we have \( y \), we can find \( x \):

\[
x = 17 - y = 17 - 4 = 13
\]

Thus, Bob bought:
- \( x = 13 \) orange fish
- \( y = 4 \) white fish

Therefore, the number of white fish Bob bought at the store is \( \boxed{4} \).",0.00145275,36.08245086669922,0,0,gpt-4o-mini,,,1

- Since she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \).
- She uses twice as much oil as salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2s \).

   \]

2. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, which can be expressed as:
   \[
   b = s + 12 = 3p + 12
   \]

3. The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   b + s + p = 341

Now, substituting the expressions for \( b \) and \( s \) into the total equation:
\[
(3p + 12) + (3p) + p = 341

Combining like terms:
\[
3p + 12 + 3p + p = 341

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The weight of the book is 4 pounds.
   - The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles.
   - The shipping cost is calculated as follows:
     - Cost per pound: $0.35
     - Cost per mile: $0.08

   **Shipping cost calculation:**
   \[
   \text{Shipping cost} = (\text{Weight} \times \text{Cost per pound}) + (\text{Distance} \times \text{Cost per mile})
   \]
   \[
   \text{Shipping cost} = (4 \, \text{pounds} \times 0.35) + (20 \, \text{miles} \times 0.08)
   \]
   \[
   \text{Shipping cost} = (1.4) + (1.6) = 3.0
   \]
   So, the total shipping cost is **$3.00**.

2. **Calculate the refund from Amazon:**
   - The cost of the book is $32.
   - Amazon refunds 75% of the purchase price.

   **Refund calculation:**
   \[
   \text{Refund} = \text{Cost of the book} \times 0.75
   \]
   \[
   \text{Refund} = 32 \times 0.75 = 24
   \]
   So, the refund from Amazon is **$24.00**.

3. **Calculate Milly's total loss:**

   \[
   \text{Total loss} = \text{Shipping cost} - \text{Refund}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total loss} = 3.00 - 24.00

   Since the refund is greater than the shipping cost, we need to consider the total amount spent versus the refund:
   \[
   \text{Total loss} = \text{Cost of the book} + \text{Shipping cost} - \text{Refund}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total loss} = 32 + 3 - 24 = 11

2. **Jack's Socks**: According to the problem, Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks. Let \( S_J \) be the number of socks Jack has. The relationship can be expressed as:
   \[
   2S_J = 60

   Solving for \( S_J \):
   \[
   S_J = \frac{60}{2} = 30

   So, Jack has 30 socks.

3. **Peter's Socks**: Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. Let \( S_P \) be the number of socks Peter has. Therefore:
   \[
   S_P = 2 \times S_J = 2 \times 30 = 60
   \]
   So, Peter has 60 socks.

4. **Peter's Dishes**: The problem states that Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. Let \( D_P \) be the number of dishes Peter has. Therefore:
   \[
   D_P = \frac{1}{2} \times D_J

\[
A = P + I
\]

where:
- \( A \) is the total amount after interest,
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial investment),
- \( I \) is the interest earned.

The interest \( I \) can be calculated using the formula:

\[
I = P \times r \times t
\]

where:
- \( r \) is the rate of interest per year,
- \( t \) is the time in years.

In this case:
- \( P = 300 \) (the initial investment),

gsm8k,gsm8k-852,SC-5,1,"To calculate the total cost of buying 3 baskets of green food and red food, we first need to determine how many of each type of basket is being purchased. Let's assume you buy \( x \) baskets of green food and \( y \) baskets of red food, with the condition that \( x + y = 3 \).

Let's denote:
- The cost of a basket of green food as \( C_g = 25 \) dollars.
- The cost of a basket of red food as \( C_r = 18 \) dollars.
- The discount on each basket of red food as \( D = 2 \) dollars.

The effective cost of a basket of red food after the discount is:
\[
C_r' = C_r - D = 18 - 2 = 16 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we can express the total cost \( T \) for \( x \) baskets of green food and \( y \) baskets of red food as follows:
\[
T = x \cdot C_g + y \cdot C_r'
\]

Substituting the values we have:
\[
T = x \cdot 25 + y \cdot 16
\]

Since \( x + y = 3 \), we can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
\[
y = 3 - x
\]

Now substituting \( y \) into the total cost equation:
\[
T = x \cdot 25 + (3 - x) \cdot 16
\]

Expanding this:
\[
T = 25x + 48 - 16x
\]
\[
T = 9x + 48
\]

Now we can calculate the total cost for different combinations of \( x \) and \( y \):

1. If \( x = 0 \) (0 green, 3 red):
   \[
   T = 9(0) + 48 = 48 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. If \( x = 1 \) (1 green, 2 red):
   \[
   T = 9(1) + 48 = 9 + 48 = 57 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. If \( x = 2 \) (2 green, 1 red):
   \[
   T = 9(2) + 48 = 18 + 48 = 66 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. If \( x = 3 \) (3 green, 0 red):
   \[
   T = 9(3) + 48 = 27 + 48 = 75 \text{ dollars}

Thus, depending on how many baskets of green and red food you buy, the total cost will vary. The total cost for each combination is:

- 1 green, 2 red: $57
- 2 green, 1 red: $66
- 3 green, 0 red: $75

- Your sister's age will be \( x - 2 \) (since you are two years older).
- Your mom's age will be \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \) (since her age is one less than three times your brother's age).

Now, we can set up the equation based on the total age:

From the problem, we have the following equations:

1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (the total number of books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) into the first equation.

First, substitute \( S \) from equation 2 into equation 1:

\[
(A + 25) + A + F = 85
\]

This simplifies to:

\[

gsm8k,gsm8k-882,SC-5,1,"To determine how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the items in her cart and then subtract that from her budget of $65.

1. **Cost of bacon**: 
   - Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total.

2. **Cost of chicken**: 
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. 
   - Since 5 packs of bacon cost $10, the cost of one pack of bacon is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of one pack of bacon} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Therefore, the cost of one packet of chicken is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of one packet of chicken} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost for chicken is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of chicken} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Cost of strawberries**: 
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, each priced at $4. 
   - The total cost for strawberries is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of strawberries} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Cost of apples**: 
   - Each pack of apples is priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries. 
   - Since each pack of strawberries costs $4, the cost of one pack of apples is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of one pack of apples} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost for apples is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of apples} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Total cost of all items**:
   - Now, we can sum up the costs of all items:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of bacon} + \text{Cost of chicken} + \text{Cost of strawberries} + \text{Cost of apples}

gsm8k,gsm8k-894,SC-5,1,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the variables**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
   - Then, the number of times she mowed Kamala's lawn is \( 3x \) (since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's).
   - The number of times she mowed Alba's lawn is \( 5x \) (since she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many as Joe's).

2. **Calculate the payments**:
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for mowing his lawn \( x \) times. Therefore, Tasha earned \( 6x \) from Joe.
   - For Kamala, since she mowed her lawn \( 3x \) times, we need to know how much she earned from Kamala. However, the problem does not specify how much Kamala paid her, so we will denote Kamala's payment as \( K \) (the total payment from Kamala).
   - For Alba, since she mowed her lawn \( 5x \) times, we will denote Alba's payment as \( A \) (the total payment from Alba).

3. **Total earnings**:
   - Tasha's total earnings from mowing lawns can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{Total earnings} = 6x + K + A
     \]

4. **Total earnings from lemonade**:
   - We know that Tasha made a total of $80 from both lemonade and mowing lawns. Therefore, we can express this as:
     \[
     \text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings from lemonade} + \text{Earnings from mowing}
     \]
   - Let \( L \) be the amount she made from lemonade sales. Thus:
     \[
     80 = L + (6x + K + A)
     \]

5. **Finding the values**:
   - We need to find \( L \). However, we do not have enough information to determine \( K \) and \( A \) specifically. But we can express \( L \) in terms of \( x \):
     \[
     L = 80 - (6x + K + A)
     \]

6. **Assuming payments**:
   - If we assume that Kamala and Alba paid Tasha the same rate as Joe, we can set \( K = 6(3x) = 18x \) (for Kamala) and \( A = 6(5x) = 30x \) (for Alba).
   - Then, substituting these into the total earnings:
     \[
     6x + 18x + 30x = 54x
     \]
   - So, we have:
     \[
     L = 80 - 54x
     \]

7. **Finding \( x \)**:
   - To find \( x \), we need to ensure that \( L \) is non-negative:
     \[
     80 - 54x \geq 0 \implies 54x \leq 80 \implies x \leq \frac{80}{54} \approx 1.48
     \]
   - Since \( x \) must be a whole number, the maximum value for \( x \) is 1.

8. **Calculating \( L \)**:
   - If \( x = 1 \):
     \[
     L = 80 - 54(1) = 80 - 54 = 26

Thus, Tasha made **$26 from lemonade sales**.",0.00203895,52.251112937927246,0,0,gpt-4o-mini,,,1

1. **Monday**: Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
2. **Tuesday**: She removed twice as many as Monday, so:
   \[
   2 \times 39 = 78 \text{ Junebugs}
   \]
3. **Wednesday**: She removed the same amount as Tuesday, so:
   \[
   78 \text{ Junebugs}

4. **Thursday**: She removed 48 Junebugs.
5. **Friday**: She removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, we can sum up the total number of Junebugs removed from Monday to Friday:

gsm8k,gsm8k-931,SC-5,1,"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( A \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + A + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   A = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's ages:
   \[
   P = A + J
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( P \) into the first equation.

Substituting \( A = J + 10 \) into \( P = A + J \):
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now we substitute \( P \) and \( A \) into the combined age equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplifying this:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Now, subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Dividing by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now we can find \( A \) (Paul's age):
\[
A = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30

P = A + J = 30 + 20 = 50

2. **Cost of a 12-hour stay plus additional hours**:
   - The initial 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos.
   - Cameron arrives at 5 PM and wants to leave at 10 AM the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours (from 5 PM to 10 AM).
   - Since he is paying for the first 12 hours, he needs to pay for an additional 5 hours (17 hours - 12 hours = 5 hours).
   - The cost for the additional hours is calculated as follows:
     - Additional cost = 5 hours × 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the 12-hour stay plus additional hours is:

1. **Yams**: 
   - Number of yams = 6
   - Price per yam = $1.5
   - Total earnings from yams = 6 yams * $1.5/yam = $9.00

2. **Sweet Potatoes**: 
   - Number of sweet potatoes = 10

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   - Total distance of the lake = 20 miles
   - Distance swum initially = 60% of 20 miles = 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles

2. **Calculate the time taken to swim the initial distance:**
   - Swimming speed = 2 miles per hour
   - Time taken to swim 12 miles = Distance / Speed = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours

3. **Calculate the resting time:**
   - Resting time = half of the swimming time = 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to swim:**
   - Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance swum = 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles

5. **Calculate the speed for the remaining distance:**
   - Speed for the remaining distance = half of the initial speed = 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour

6. **Calculate the time taken to swim the remaining distance:**
   - Time taken to swim 8 miles = Remaining Distance / Speed = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The total points scored by all three is 45:
   \[
   B + A + D = 45

2. Bahati scored 20 points more than Azibo:
   \[
   B = A + 20
   \]

3. Bahati scored 10 points more than Dinar:
   \[
   B = D + 10
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( B \) from the second and third equations into the first equation.

From \( B = A + 20 \), we can express \( A \) in terms of \( B \):
\[
A = B - 20
\]

From \( B = D + 10 \), we can express \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
\[
D = B - 10
\]

Now, substitute \( A \) and \( D \) into the total points equation:
\[
B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45

2S + \frac{S + 13}{4} = 334
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 4:
\[
8S + (S + 13) = 1336
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
9S + 13 = 1336
\]
Subtracting 13 from both sides gives:
\[
9S = 1323
\]
Dividing by 9:
\[
S = 147
\]

Now we can find the number of Pokemon caught by Alex and Adelwolfe. 

Using \( S = 147 \) in equation 2:
\[
A = S + 5 = 147 + 5 = 152
\]

Using \( S = 147 \) in equation 3 to find \( D \):
\[
147 = 4D - 13
\]
Adding 13 to both sides:
\[
160 = 4D
\]
Dividing by 4:
\[
D = 40
\]

Now we can verify:
- Total caught: \( A + S + D = 152 + 147 + 40 = 339 \) (correct)
- Alex has caught 5 more than Stan: \( 152 = 147 + 5 \) (correct)
- Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe: \( 147 = 4 \times 40 - 13 \) (correct)

Thus, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan is:

1. **First leg of the journey (south)**:
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 10 hours = 300 miles

2. **Second leg of the journey (north)**:
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 miles/hour × 2 hours = 36 miles

3. **Third leg of the journey (south)**:
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 22 miles/hour × 5 hours = 110 miles

Now, we can calculate the total distance traveled south and north:

**Saturday:**
- Boxes of gingerbread sold: 10
- Boxes of apple pie sold: \( x \) (where \( x \) is the number of boxes sold on Sunday minus 4)

**Sunday:**
- Boxes of gingerbread sold: \( 10 + 5 = 15 \)
- Boxes of apple pie sold: 15

From the information given, we can set up the equation for Saturday's apple pie sales:
- Since he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie on Saturday than on Sunday, we have:

  x = 15 - 4 = 11
  \]
So, on Saturday, he sold:
- Boxes of gingerbread: 10
- Boxes of apple pie: 11

### Step 2: Calculate total sales for each day

**Saturday:**
- Revenue from gingerbread: 
  \[
  10 \text{ boxes} \times 6 \text{ dollars/box} = 60 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Revenue from apple pie:
  \[
  11 \text{ boxes} \times 15 \text{ dollars/box} = 165 \text{ dollars}

gsm8k,gsm8k-984,SC-5,1,"To determine how much money Pat will spend to fill her flower bed, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the flower bed length to inches**:  
   Since the flowers grow 12 inches wide, we need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches.  
   \[
   111 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 1332 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total space each plant occupies**:  
   Each flower occupies 12 inches in width, and there is a 1.5 feet (which is 18 inches) gap between each plant. Therefore, the total space occupied by one plant and the gap after it is:  
   \[
   12 \text{ inches} + 18 \text{ inches} = 30 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Determine how many plants can fit in the flower bed**:  
   To find out how many plants can fit in the flower bed, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the space each plant occupies:  
   \[
   \frac{1332 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/plant}} \approx 44.4
   \]
   Since Pat can only plant whole flowers, we round down to 44 plants.

4. **Calculate how many additional plants Pat needs**:  
   Pat already owns 17 flowers, so we need to find out how many more she needs:  
   \[
   44 \text{ plants} - 17 \text{ plants} = 27 \text{ additional plants}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost for the additional plants**:  
   Each flowering plant costs $6, so the total cost for 27 additional plants is:  
   \[
   27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}
   \]

When Bill's dad saw the comet for the first time, he was 30 years old. After 75 years, Bill's dad would be:

\[
D + 75 = 30 + 75 = 105 \text{ years old}
\]

Now, we need to find out when Bill saw the comet for the second time. According to the problem, Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he first saw the comet. 

Let \( B \) be Bill's age when he first saw the comet. The age of Bill's dad when he first saw the comet is 30 years, so:

\[
\text{Bill's age when he saw the comet the second time} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ years old}
\]

Now, since Bill's dad was 30 years old when he first saw the comet and 105 years old when it appeared again, we can find the difference in years between the two sightings:

   \frac{3}{4}x
   \]

2. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. The remaining flights can be calculated as:
   \[
   x - \frac{3}{4}x = \frac{1}{4}x
   \]
   Since these remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is:

- Olivia has **18 portraits**.

To ensure the total adds up correctly, we can check:

gsm8k,gsm8k-1022,SC-5,1,"Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( L \) and the number of small stuffed animals sold as \( S \).

According to the problem:
1. Teresa sells small stuffed animals for $4 each.
2. Large stuffed animals are sold for three times the price of small ones, so they cost \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars each.
3. Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, which gives us the equation:
   \[
   S = 2L
   \]
4. The total earnings from the sales were $120, leading to the equation:
   \[
   4S + 12L = 120
   \]

Now, we can substitute \( S \) from the first equation into the second equation:

Substituting \( S = 2L \) into \( 4S + 12L = 120 \):
\[
4(2L) + 12L = 120
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
8L + 12L = 120
\]
\[
20L = 120
\]
Now, divide both sides by 20:
\[
L = 6
\]

Now that we have the number of large stuffed animals sold, we can find the number of small stuffed animals sold using \( S = 2L \):

gsm8k,gsm8k-1030,SC-5,1,"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we can break down the problem into different scenarios based on the presence of the substitute teacher and the normal teacher.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario**:
   - There is a 50% chance that a substitute teacher will be present. If a substitute is present, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario**:
   - There is a 50% chance that the normal teacher will be present. If the normal teacher is present, we need to consider the following:
     - There is a 40% chance that the teacher will give an extension. If she gives an extension, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.
     - There is a 60% chance that the teacher will not give an extension. In this case, we need to consider Marcus's chance of getting a personal extension:
       - There is a 20% chance that Marcus can convince the teacher that his dog ate his homework and get a personal extension. If he gets this extension, he does not have to turn in his homework.
       - There is an 80% chance that he cannot convince the teacher, meaning he will have to turn in his homework.

Now, let's calculate the probabilities step by step:

1. **Probability of having to turn in homework with the normal teacher**:
   - Probability of normal teacher = 50% = 0.5
   - Probability of no extension from the teacher = 60% = 0.6
   - Probability of not getting a personal extension = 80% = 0.8

   The probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework if the normal teacher is present is:
   \[
   P(\text{turn in homework | normal teacher}) = P(\text{no extension}) \times P(\text{no personal extension}) = 0.6 \times 0.8 = 0.48
   \]

2. **Overall probability of having to turn in homework**:
   - Probability of having to turn in homework with the substitute teacher = 0 (since he doesn't have to turn it in)
   - Probability of having to turn in homework with the normal teacher = 0.5 (probability of normal teacher) × 0.48 (probability of having to turn in homework if normal teacher is present)

   Therefore, the overall probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework is:
   \[
   P(\text{turn in homework}) = P(\text{normal teacher}) \times P(\text{turn in homework | normal teacher}) = 0.5 \times 0.48 = 0.24
   \]

Finally, to express this as a percentage:

P(\text{turn in homework}) = 0.24 \times 100 = 24\%

gsm8k,gsm8k-1042,SC-5,1,"To find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide it by the number of races.

1. **First Race:**
   - Loss = $5

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - Amount lost in the first race = $5
   - Twice the amount lost = \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
   - Therefore, the amount won in the second race = \(10 + 1 = 11\)

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Amount won in the second race = $11
   - Therefore, the amount lost in the third race = \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\)

Now, we can summarize the results:
- Total loss from the first race = $5
- Total win from the second race = $11 (this is not a loss, so we won't include it in the total loss)
- Total loss from the third race = $16.5

4. **Total Loss Calculation:**
   - Total loss = Loss from the first race + Loss from the third race
   - Total loss = \(5 + 16.5 = 21.5\)

5. **Average Loss Calculation:**
   - Number of races = 3
   - Average loss = Total loss / Number of races
   - Average loss = \(21.5 / 3 \approx 7.1667\)

Thus, Johnny's dad lost approximately **$7.17** on average that day.",0.0011876999999999,35.517515897750854,0,0,gpt-4o-mini,,,0

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took \( 2 \times (x + 80) \).

Now, we can express the total amount taken by all three people as follows:

\[
x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920
\]

Now, let's simplify the equation step by step:

1. Combine the terms:
   \[
   x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 4x + 240
   \]

2. Set the equation equal to 1920:
   \[
   4x + 240 = 1920
   \]

3. Subtract 240 from both sides:
   \[
   4x = 1920 - 240

   \[
   4x = 1680

- The second person took \( 420 + 80 = 500 \).
- The third person took \( 2 \times 500 = 1000 \).

Now, adding these amounts:

1. **Determine the total number of days worked**: 
   - There are 3 weeks, and each week has 7 days.
   - Total days = 3 weeks × 7 days/week = 21 days.

2. **Calculate the total hours worked by the team**:
   - Each day, the team worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day.
   - Total hours worked by the team = Total days × Hours worked per day.
   - Since a full day is typically 8 hours, we can calculate:

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls (four more than in the second set).
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls (half as many as in the second set).

The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is given as 19. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Now, let's simplify this equation step by step:

1. Combine like terms:
   \[
   2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
   \]

2. To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 2:
   \[
   2(2x + 4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2 \cdot 19
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   4x + 8 + x = 38
   \]

3. Combine the \( x \) terms:
   \[
   5x + 8 = 38

     \[
     300 \, \text{(per hour)} \times 0.5 \, \text{(hour)} = 150
     \]
3. **Cost of painkillers**:
   - Each pill costs $4, and she needs 30 pills, so the total cost for the painkillers is:
     \[
     4 \, \text{(per pill)} \times 30 \, \text{(pills)} = 120
     \]
4. **Cost of parking**:
   - The parking charge is $6 per hour, and there is a mandatory minimum of 2 hours. Therefore, the parking cost is:
     \[
     6 \, \text{(per hour)} \times 2 \, \text{(hours)} = 12
     \]

Now, we can sum all these costs to find the total cost of the doctor's visit:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost of cast} + \text{Cost of visit} + \text{Cost of painkillers} + \text{Cost of parking}
\]
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 200 + 150 + 120 + 12 = 482

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrival: Half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 60 minutes
   - Departure: The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed (20 minutes / 4 = 5 minutes), so it leaves at 60 minutes + 5 minutes = 65 minutes

3. **Third Train:**

gsm8k,gsm8k-1081,SC-5,1,"To find Frankie's score, we can use the information given in the problem.

1. We know Binkie's score is 90.
2. According to the problem, Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score.

Let's denote Binkie's score as \( B \) and Frankie's score as \( F \).

From the problem, we have:
- \( B = 90 \)
- \( F = 2B + 15 \)

Now, we can substitute Binkie's score into the equation for Frankie's score:

\[
F = 2(90) + 15
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

1. Calculate \( 2 \times 90 \):
   \[
   2 \times 90 = 180
   \]

2. Now add 15 to this result:
   \[
   180 + 15 = 195

1. **Distance to the store**: 4 miles
2. **Speed**: 4 miles per hour

First, we calculate the time it takes for James to walk to the store:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour}
\]

However, James only walked halfway to the store before realizing he forgot something. Halfway to the store is:

\[
\text{Halfway distance} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{2} = 2 \text{ miles}
\]

Now, we calculate the time it took him to walk halfway to the store:

\[
\text{Time to halfway} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

After realizing he forgot something, he walked back home, which is also 2 miles. The time taken to walk back home is the same as the time taken to walk halfway to the store:

\[
\text{Time to walk back home} = 0.5 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

Finally, James will then walk the remaining distance to the store, which is again 2 miles. The time taken to walk the last half to the store is:

\[
\text{Time to walk remaining distance} = 0.5 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we add up all the time taken:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time to halfway} + \text{Time to walk back} + \text{Time to remaining distance}
\]
\[
\text{Total time} = 0.5 \text{ hours} + 0.5 \text{ hours} + 0.5 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ hours}

1. **Calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought:**
   - She bought 10 bunches, and each bunch has an average of 4 bananas.
   \[
   \text{Total bananas} = 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas/bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually:**
   - The cost of each banana is $0.80.
   \[
   \text{Cost of 40 bananas} = 40 \text{ bananas} \times 0.80 \text{ dollars/banana} = 32 \text{ dollars}

gsm8k,gsm8k-1084,SC-5,1,"Let's denote the amount of fence that Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so we can express the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H = S + 60 \) feet.

Since the total amount of fence is 100 feet, we can set up the following equation:

\[
S + H = 100
\]

Substituting the expression for \( H \) into the equation gives us:

\[
S + (S + 60) = 100
\]

Simplifying this, we have:

\[
2S + 60 = 100
\]

Next, we subtract 60 from both sides:

\[
2S = 40
\]

Now, we divide both sides by 2:

\[
S = 20
\]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence. To find out how much Harry gets, we substitute \( S \) back into the equation for \( H \):

2. **Return of Item**: She returned an item that cost $15.00. We need to subtract this amount from the initial charge:
   \[
   85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00
   \]

3. **Purchase of Frying Pan**: The frying pan is originally priced at $20.00, and it is on sale for 20% off. We calculate the discount:
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 20\% \text{ of } 20.00 = 0.20 \times 20.00 = 4.00
   \]
   Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price:

1. **Calculate the total production of the first four workers:**
   - The first 2 workers produce 6 toys per hour each. Therefore, their combined production per hour is:
     \[
     2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ toys/hour}
     \]
   - The next 2 workers produce 4 toys per hour each. Therefore, their combined production per hour is:
     \[
     2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ toys/hour}
     \]
   - Thus, the total production per hour of all four workers is:
     \[
     12 + 8 = 20 \text{ toys/hour}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total production over the 10-hour shift:**
   - Over a 10-hour shift, the total production of the first four workers is:
     \[
     20 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ toys}
     \]

3. **Determine the total number of toys produced by all workers:**
   - The manufacturer needs to produce a total of 400 toys. After the 10-hour shift, they still need 20 more toys, which means they have produced:
     \[
     400 - 20 = 380 \text{ toys}
     \]

4. **Calculate the contribution of the fifth worker:**
   - Since the first four workers produced 200 toys, we can find the production of the fifth worker by subtracting this from the total toys produced:
     \[
     380 - 200 = 180 \text{ toys}
     \]

5. **Calculate the production rate of the fifth worker:**
   - If the fifth worker produced 180 toys over the same 10-hour shift, their production rate is:
     \[
     \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys/hour}

Next, let’s denote the number of eggs painted by Sarah as \( y \). According to the problem, Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so we can express Camden's painted eggs as:

- Sarah: \( y \)
- Camden: \( y + 12 \)

We know from the problem that Camden and Sarah together painted a total of 30 eggs. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
y + (y + 12) = 30
\]

Simplifying this equation:

\[
2y + 12 = 30
\]
\[
2y = 30 - 12

From the problem, we know the following:

1. Jim collected 27 seashells: 
   \[
   J = 27
   \]

2. Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos:
   \[
   J = C + 5

- Let \( r \) be the length of the red rope.
- Let \( b \) be the length of the blue rope.
- Let \( y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope:
   \[
   r = 4b
   \]

2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope:
   \[
   b = y - 7
   \]

3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters:
   \[
   r + b + y = 37
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( r \) and \( b \) into the combined length equation.

Substituting \( r = 4b \) into the combined length equation:
\[
4b + b + y = 37
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
5b + y = 37
\]

Next, substitute \( b = y - 7 \) into the equation:
\[
5(y - 7) + y = 37
\]
Expanding this gives:
\[
5y - 35 + y = 37
\]
Combining like terms results in:

Adding 35 to both sides:

   \text{Chalk used on Monday} = 0.45 \times 5 = 2.25 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Remaining chalk after Monday**: We subtract the chalk used from the initial amount:
   \[
   \text{Remaining chalk} = 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Daily usage after Monday**: The teacher plans to use only 20% of the chalk each day. We calculate 20% of the remaining chalk:
   \[
   \text{Daily usage} = 0.20 \times 2.75 = 0.55 \text{ inches}
   \]

5. **Determine how many days until recycling**: The teacher will recycle the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. We need to find out how many days he can use 0.55 inches of chalk before it drops below 2 inches.

   - Starting from 2.75 inches, we need to find how many days \(d\) it takes for the chalk to reach 2 inches:
   \[
   2.75 - 0.55d = 2
   \]

   - Solving for \(d\):
   \[
   2.75 - 2 = 0.55d \\
   0.75 = 0.55d \\
   d = \frac{0.75}{0.55} \approx 1.36
   \]

Since \(d\) must be a whole number (as he can't use chalk for a fraction of a day), he can use the chalk for 1 full day before it drops below 2 inches.

6. **Final conclusion**: The teacher can use the chalk for **1 more day** before he has to recycle it.",0.0018011999999999,48.68450307846069,0,0,gpt-4o-mini,,,0

gsm8k,gsm8k-1181,SC-5,1,"Let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

We have two pieces of information from the problem:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now:
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7)
   \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now:
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} W
   \]

Now, we can solve these equations step by step.

### Step 1: Rewrite the equations

From the first equation:
\[
W = 5(C + 7) = 5C + 35
\]

From the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} W
\]

### Step 2: Substitute \( W \) in the second equation

Substituting \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35)
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the equation

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5C + 35
\]
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

### Step 4: Rearrange the equation

Now, rearranging gives:
\[
75 - 35 = 5C - 3C
\]
\[
40 = 2C
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( C \)

Dividing both sides by 2:
\[
C = 20
\]

### Conclusion

Colin is currently \( \boxed{20} \) years old.

### Verification

1. If Colin is 20, then in 7 years he will be \( 20 + 7 = 27 \).
   - Wendy's age will be \( W = 5 \times 27 = 135 \).

2. In 25 years, Colin will be \( 20 + 25 = 45 \).

1. **Building Rate**: Jay can build 20 snowballs in 1 hour (60 minutes). This means he builds:
   \[
   \frac{20 \text{ snowballs}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ snowballs per minute}
   \]

2. **Melting Rate**: Jay loses 2 snowballs every 15 minutes. This means he loses:
   \[
   \frac{2 \text{ snowballs}}{15 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{2}{15} \text{ snowballs per minute}
   \]

3. **Net Rate of Snowballs**: The net rate at which Jay gains snowballs is the building rate minus the melting rate:
   \[
   \text{Net rate} = \frac{1}{3} - \frac{2}{15}

1. **Calculate the number of red pens:**
   - Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens.
   - Each pack contains 5 pens.
   - Therefore, the total number of red pens is:
     \[
     \text{Total red pens} = 5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens per pack} = 25 \text{ red pens}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of black pens:**
   - Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens.
   - Therefore, the total number of black pens is:
     \[
     \text{Total black pens} = 2 \times \text{Total red pens} = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ black pens}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of pens:**
   - Now, we add the number of red pens and black pens together:
     \[
     \text{Total pens} = \text{Total red pens} + \text{Total black pens} = 25 + 50 = 75 \text{ pens}

gsm8k,gsm8k-1197,SC-5,1,"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total of $600.

Cost per bottle of scotch:
\[
\text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{\text{Total cost of scotch}}{\text{Number of bottles}} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as he bought of scotch. Since he bought 10 bottles of scotch, he buys:
\[
\text{Number of bottles of cognac} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles}
\]

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:
\[
\text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} + 0.5 \times \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the cognac:
\[
\text{Total cost of cognac} = \text{Number of bottles of cognac} \times \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we can find the total amount John spends on both scotch and cognac:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost of scotch} + \text{Total cost of cognac} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, John spends a total of **$2400** on everything.",0.0011932499999999,34.365519523620605,0,0,gpt-4o-mini,,,1

2. **Second Day Planting:**
   - He planted 10 more White Oak trees than the first day:
     \[
     \text{White Oak on Day 2} = 20 + 10 = 30
     \]
   - He planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he planted on the first day. First, we calculate 1/4 of the Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
     \]
   - Therefore, the number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is:
     \[
     \text{Lodgepole Pine on Day 2} = 40 + 10 = 50
     \]

   So, on the second day, he planted:
   - White Oak: 30 trees

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar**:
   The jar has a square base with dimensions 6 inches by 6 inches and a height of 15 inches. The volume \( V \) of the jar can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:

   \[
   V = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = (6 \, \text{inches} \times 6 \, \text{inches}) \times 15 \, \text{inches} = 36 \, \text{inches}^2 \times 15 \, \text{inches} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the effective volume for jelly beans**:
   Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the effective volume for the jelly beans is:

   \[
   \text{Effective volume} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches} \times 0.80 = 432 \, \text{cubic inches}

3. **Calculate the total number of jelly beans**:
   Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches. Therefore, the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar is:

   \[
   \text{Total jelly beans} = \frac{\text{Effective volume}}{\text{Volume per jelly bean}} = \frac{432 \, \text{cubic inches}}{0.15 \, \text{cubic inches per jelly bean}} = 2880 \, \text{jelly beans}

1. **Initial number of passengers**: The bus starts with 20 people.

2. **First stop**: 40 people enter the bus.
   - Total passengers after the first stop = 20 (initial) + 40 (entered) = 60 people.

3. **Second stop**: 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop enter the bus.
   - Number of people who entered at the first stop = 40.
   - Number of people entering at the second stop = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30 \).

1. **Determine the capacity of each shelf:**
   - Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
   - There are 2 middle shelves, so the total capacity of the middle shelves is:
     \[
     2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ books}
     \]
   - The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf:
     \[
     2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ books}
     \]
   - The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf:
     \[
     20 - 5 = 15 \text{ books}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total capacity of one bookcase:**
   - Total capacity of one bookcase is the sum of the capacities of all shelves:
     \[
     \text{Total capacity} = \text{Middle shelves} + \text{Bottom shelf} + \text{Top shelf}

The total number of ice cubes made by Mary is the sum of the strawberry cubes and the blueberry cubes:

\[
x + (5x - 4) = 116
\]

Now, we can simplify this equation:

\[
x + 5x - 4 = 116

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:
\[
6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes}
\]

So, when Nate returns, there are 84 holes that need to be filled in.

Next, we need to determine how many holes Nate can fill in each day, considering that the dog continues to dig new holes every night. Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes each night. Therefore, the net number of holes filled each day is:
\[
9 \text{ holes filled} - 6 \text{ holes dug} = 3 \text{ holes net filled per day}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take Nate to fill in all 84 holes at this rate:
\[
\frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days}
\]

Finally, we convert the number of days into weeks:
\[

- Test tubes: \( T = 16 \)
- Beakers: \( B = 7 \)
- Petri dishes: \( P = 14 \)

Now, let's analyze what Igor actually gathered:

1. **Test tubes**: Igor gathered half of the requested amount, so he gathered:
   \[
   \text{Test tubes gathered} = \frac{T}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8
   \]

2. **Petri dishes**: Igor gathered two more than the requested amount, so he gathered:
   \[
   \text{Petri dishes gathered} = P + 2 = 14 + 2 = 16
   \]

3. **Beakers**: Igor gathered the correct number of beakers, which is:
   \[
   \text{Beakers gathered} = B = 7
   \]

Next, we can calculate the total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench before considering any losses:

\[
\text{Total items gathered} = \text{Test tubes gathered} + \text{Beakers gathered} + \text{Petri dishes gathered}
\]
\[
\text{Total items gathered} = 8 + 7 + 16 = 31

\[
\text{Items lost} = \text{Total items gathered} - \text{Total items placed on bench}
\]
\[
\text{Items lost} = 31 - 29 = 2
\]

Since Igor gathered the correct number of beakers (7), the number of beakers he lost is:

\[
\text{Beakers lost} = \text{Items lost} = 2
\]

Thus, the number of beakers Igor lost is \( \boxed{2} \).",0.0012625499999999,27.628731727600098,0,0,gpt-4o-mini,,,1

1. **Alexandra's amount**: 
   - Alexandra raises $430.

2. **Kim's amount**: 
   - Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra.
   - So, Kim's amount = Alexandra's amount + $320 = $430 + $320 = $750.

3. **Sarah's amount**: 
   - Sarah raises $300.

4. **Maryam's amount**:

1. **Understanding the speeds**:
   - Let \( v \) be the speed of Vanessa in miles per minute.
   - Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Aaron's speed is \( 2v \).

2. **Distance run by Vanessa**:
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles.

3. **Distance run by Aaron**:
   - Since Vanessa can run twice as far as Aaron, we can denote the distance Aaron ran as \( d \). Therefore, \( d = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.

4. **Time taken by Aaron**:
   - We know Aaron completed his part of the race (2 miles) in 16 minutes. 
   - Using the formula for time, \( \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \), we can find Aaron's speed:
     \[
     \text{Time for Aaron} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{2v} = 16 \text{ minutes}
