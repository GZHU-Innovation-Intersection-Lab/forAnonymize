mbpp,Mbpp/620,SC-5,1,"To solve the problem of finding the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair in the subset is divisible, we can use a dynamic programming approach. The idea is to sort the numbers and then use a dynamic programming array to keep track of the largest divisible subset that can be formed up to each number.

Here's how we can implement this:

1. Sort the input list.
2. Initialize a dynamic programming array where each entry starts with a value of 1 (each number can be a subset of itself).
3. For each number, check all previous numbers to see if they can form a divisible pair. If they can, update the dynamic programming array accordingly.
4. The result will be the maximum value in the dynamic programming array.

Here is the implementation in Python:

```python
def largest_subset(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    
    # Sort the numbers
    nums.sort()
    
    # Initialize the dp array
    n = len(nums)
    dp = [1] * n
    
    # Fill the dp array
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    
    # The size of the largest subset is the maximum value in dp
    return max(dp)

# Test the function with the provided assertion
assert largest_subset([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]) == 4
```

### Explanation:
- We first sort the list of numbers to ensure that we can check divisibility in a structured manner.
- The `dp` array keeps track of the size of the largest divisible subset that ends with each number.
- For each number, we check all previous numbers to see if the current number is divisible by any of them. If it is, we update the `dp` value for the current number.
- Finally, we return the maximum value found in the `dp` array, which represents the size of the largest subset where every pair is divisible.",0.00146535,46.68364262580872,,True,

mbpp,Mbpp/125,SC-5,1,"To solve the problem of finding the maximum difference between the number of 0s and the number of 1s in any substring of a given binary string, we can follow these steps:

1. **Transform the String**: Convert the binary string into a numerical representation where '0' becomes +1 and '1' becomes -1. This way, we can find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray, which will correspond to the maximum difference between the counts of 0s and 1s.

2. **Use Kadane's Algorithm**: We can apply Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sum of the transformed array. The maximum sum will give us the maximum difference between the number of 0s and 1s.

Here is the implementation of the function:

```python
def find_length(binary_string):
    # Transform the binary string into an array of +1 and -1
    transformed = [1 if char == '0' else -1 for char in binary_string]

### Explanation:
- We first create a list `transformed` where each '0' is replaced by +1 and each '1' by -1.
- We then iterate through this transformed list, maintaining a running sum (`current_sum`). If `current_sum` exceeds `max_sum`, we update `max_sum`.
- If `current_sum` drops below 0, we reset it to 0, as starting a new subarray might yield a better result.
- Finally, we return `max_sum`, which represents the maximum difference between the number of 0s and 1s in any substring of the original binary string.",0.0014639999999999,39.67192006111145,,True,

However, the expected output in the assertion is `[10, 20, 30, 15]`, which suggests a specific order. To achieve that specific order, we can modify the function to maintain the original order of elements from the first list while excluding those found in the second list.

Here's the implementation of the function:

# Test the function with the provided assertion
assert lps(""TENS FOR TENS"") == 5

### Explanation:
1. **Preprocessing**: We remove spaces and convert the string to lowercase to ensure that the comparison is case insensitive and ignores spaces.
2. **Dynamic Programming Table**: We create a 2D list `dp` where `dp[i][j]` will hold the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the substring `s[i:j+1]`.
3. **Initialization**: Each character is a palindrome of length 1, so we initialize `dp[i][i]` to 1 for all `i`.
4. **Filling the Table**: We iterate over all possible substring lengths and fill the `dp` table based on whether the characters at the ends of the substring are the same or not.
5. **Result**: The length of the longest palindromic subsequence for the entire string is found in `dp[0][n-1]`.

The binomial coefficient \( C(n, k) \) represents the number of ways to choose \( k \) elements from a set of \( n \) elements.

The even index binomial coefficients are those where the index \( k \) is even. The sum of these coefficients can be computed using the formula:

\[
\text{Sum} = C(n, 0) + C(n, 2) + C(n, 4) + \ldots

The key idea is to maintain a 2D array that keeps track of the maximum total cost and the number of cells visited to reach each cell in the matrix.

Here's how we can implement this:

1. Create a 2D list `dp` where each entry `dp[i][j]` will store a tuple containing the maximum total cost to reach cell `(i, j)` and the number of cells visited to reach that cell.
2. Initialize the starting point `(0, 0)` with its cost and a count of 1.
3. Iterate through the matrix, updating the `dp` table by considering moves from the top or left cells.
4. Finally, compute the maximum average from the bottom-right cell's total cost and the number of cells visited.

Here's the implementation in Python:

```python

### Explanation:
- The function `get_total_number_of_sequences` initializes a memoization dictionary to store previously computed results.
- The nested function `count_sequences` is defined to count the number of valid sequences starting from a given length and last value.
- We iterate through all possible starting values from 1 to `m`, and for each starting value, we call `count_sequences` to count the valid sequences of length `n`.
- Finally, we return the total count of valid sequences.

mbpp,Mbpp/799,SC-5,1,"To create a function that rotates the bits of a given 32-bit number to the left by a specified number of bits, we can follow these steps:

1. Use the bitwise left shift operator to shift the number to the left by `d` bits.
2. Use the bitwise right shift operator to shift the number to the right by `(32 - d)` bits to capture the bits that overflow.
3. Combine the two results using the bitwise OR operator.
4. Ensure that the result is still a 32-bit number by applying a bitwise AND with `0xFFFFFFFF`.

Here's the implementation of the `left_rotate` function:

```python
def left_rotate(n, d):
    # Ensure d is within the range of 0 to 31
    d = d % 32
    # Perform the left rotation
    return ((n << d) | (n >> (32 - d))) & 0xFFFFFFFF

# Test the function with the provided assertion
assert left_rotate(16, 2) == 64
```

### Explanation:
- `n << d`: This shifts the number `n` to the left by `d` bits.
- `n >> (32 - d)`: This shifts the number `n` to the right by `(32 - d)` bits, which captures the bits that overflow from the left.
- The bitwise OR (`|`) combines the two results.
- The final `& 0xFFFFFFFF` ensures that the result is treated as a 32-bit unsigned integer.

mbpp,Mbpp/109,SC-5,1,"To solve the problem of finding the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string a given number of times, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Rotation**: Rotating a binary string means moving the last character to the front or the first character to the end. For example, rotating ""011001"" once to the right gives ""101100"".

2. **Convert to Integer**: For each rotation, we need to convert the binary string to its integer equivalent and check if it is odd. A number is odd if its last binary digit is 1.

3. **Count Unique Odd Values**: We will keep track of the unique odd values obtained from the rotations.

- We use a set `unique_odds` to store unique odd integer values.
- We loop through the number of rotations, creating a new rotated string each time.
- We convert the rotated binary string to an integer using `int(rotated_string, 2)`.

1. **Count the Even and Odd Numbers**: We will iterate through the list and count how many even and odd numbers there are.
2. **Calculate Pairs**: The number of ways to choose 2 even numbers from the count of even numbers can be calculated using the combination formula \( C(n, 2) = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \). The same applies for odd numbers.
3. **Sum the Pairs**: The total number of pairs that XOR to an even number will be the sum of the pairs of even numbers and the pairs of odd numbers.

2. **Iterate through the array**: For each element in the array (starting from the second element):
   - If the current element is negative, we swap `max_product` and `min_product` because multiplying by a negative number will turn the maximum into a minimum and vice versa.
   - Update `max_product` to be the maximum of the current element itself and the product of `max_product` and the current element.
   - Update `min_product` similarly.
   - Update the `result` to keep track of the maximum product found so far.

1. Create a helper function to determine if a number is prime.
2. Generate a list of prime numbers up to the square root of the given integer.

This algorithm not only finds the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers but also provides a way to express this gcd as a linear combination of those two numbers.

Here's how we can implement the function `find_solution`:

1. Check if a solution exists by verifying if \( n \) is divisible by the gcd of \( a \) and \( b \).

1. A rotation of a string involves moving characters from the front to the back. For example, rotating ""abcd"" once gives ""bcda"".
2. We need to check how many rotations are needed until the string returns to its original form.
3. We can achieve this by generating all possible rotations of the string and checking when we get back to the original string.

Here's the implementation of the function:

### Explanation:
- The function `find_Rotations` takes a string `s` as input.
- It calculates the length of the string `n`.
- It then iterates from `1` to `n` (inclusive) to generate each rotation.
- For each rotation, it checks if the rotated string is equal to the original string.
- If it finds a match, it returns the number of rotations.
- If no match is found (which is unlikely for strings with unique characters), it returns `n`.

assert even_Power_Sum(2) == 1056
```

### Explanation:
1. The function `even_Power_Sum` takes an integer `n` as input.
2. It uses a generator expression to iterate through the first `n` natural numbers (from 1 to `n`).
3. For each `i`, it calculates the `i`-th even natural number as `2 * i` and raises it to the fifth power.
4. The `sum` function adds up all these values.
5. Finally, the assertion checks if the function works correctly for the input `2`, which should return `1056`.",0.0007768499999999,20.83791184425354,,True,

mbpp,Mbpp/780,SC-5,1,"To solve the problem of finding combinations of sums with tuples in a given list of tuples, we can follow these steps:

1. Iterate through each pair of tuples in the list.
2. For each pair, compute the sum of the first elements and the sum of the second elements.
3. Store the resulting sums as tuples in a result list.
4. Ensure that we do not include duplicate combinations.

Here's the implementation of the `find_combinations` function:

```python
def find_combinations(tuple_list):

```

### Explanation:
- We use a nested loop to iterate through all pairs of tuples.
- For each pair, we calculate the sums of the first and second elements.
- We store the results in a set to automatically handle duplicates.
- Finally, we return a sorted list of the unique combinations.

Now, let's implement the function to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number:

```python
def is_prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):

    return num

# Test the function
assert newman_prime(3) == 7
```

This code defines a function `newman_prime` that finds the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number by checking each number for primality until it reaches the desired count. The `is_prime` function is used to determine if a number is prime.

mbpp,Mbpp/278,SC-5,1,"To solve the problem of counting the number of elements that occur before a tuple element in a given tuple, we can create a function called `count_first_elements`. This function will iterate through the elements of the input tuple and check for the first occurrence of a tuple. Once it finds the tuple, it will return the count of elements that appeared before it.

Here's the implementation of the function:

```python
def count_first_elements(input_tuple):
    # Iterate through the elements of the tuple
    for index, element in enumerate(input_tuple):
        # Check if the current element is a tuple

    return 0

# Test the function with the provided assertion
assert count_first_elements((1, 5, 7, (4, 6), 10)) == 3
```

### Explanation:
1. The function `count_first_elements` takes a tuple as input.
2. It uses `enumerate` to loop through the elements of the tuple, which gives both the index and the element.
3. It checks if the current element is a tuple using `isinstance`.
4. If a tuple is found, it returns the index, which represents the count of elements before it.
5. If no tuple is found, it returns 0.

mbpp,Mbpp/392,SC-5,1,"To solve the problem, we need to implement a function `get_max_sum(n)` that calculates the maximum sum according to the given equation:

\[ f(n) = \max(f(n/2) + f(n/3) + f(n/4) + f(n/5), n) \]

This means that for a given `n`, we can either take the sum of the maximum values of the function applied to `n/2`, `n/3`, `n/4`, and `n/5`, or we can simply take `n` itself. We will use recursion along with memoization to optimize the calculations.

Here is the implementation of the function:

```python
def get_max_sum(n, memo=None):
    if memo is None:
        memo = {}
    
    # Check if the result is already computed
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    
    # Base case: if n is 0, the maximum sum is 0
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    
    # Calculate the maximum sum using the recursive formula
    max_sum = max(get_max_sum(n // 2, memo) + 
                   get_max_sum(n // 3, memo) + 
                   get_max_sum(n // 4, memo) + 
                   get_max_sum(n // 5, memo), n)
    
    # Store the result in memoization dictionary
    memo[n] = max_sum
    return max_sum

# Test the function with the given assertion
assert get_max_sum(60) == 106
```

### Explanation:
1. **Memoization**: We use a dictionary `memo` to store previously computed results for different values of `n` to avoid redundant calculations.
2. **Base Case**: If `n` is 0, the maximum sum is 0.
3. **Recursive Calculation**: We compute the maximum sum by evaluating the recursive calls for `n/2`, `n/3`, `n/4`, and `n/5`, and then taking the maximum of that sum and `n`.
4. **Assertion**: The function is tested with the assertion provided to ensure it returns the expected result.

mbpp,Mbpp/767,SC-5,1,"To solve the problem of counting the number of pairs in a list whose sum equals a given value, we can use a dictionary to keep track of the occurrences of each number. This approach allows us to efficiently count pairs without needing to check every possible combination explicitly.

Here's the implementation of the `get_pairs_count` function:

```python
def get_pairs_count(numbers, target_sum):
    count = 0
    num_count = {}

    # Count occurrences of each number in the list

### Explanation:
1. **Counting Occurrences**: We first create a dictionary `num_count` to count how many times each number appears in the input list.
2. **Finding Pairs**: For each number in the list, we calculate its complement (the number that, when added to it, equals `target_sum`). We then check how many times this complement appears in the dictionary.
3. **Adjusting for Same Numbers**: If the number and its complement are the same (e.g., when both are 1), we need to subtract one from the count to avoid counting the pair (1, 1) twice.
4. **Final Count**: Since each pair is counted twice (once for each number in the pair), we divide the final count by 2 before returning it.

This function will correctly count the number of pairs whose sum equals the specified value.",0.0013582499999999,28.314436435699463,,True,

This function will take two lists as input: one representing the elements (like colors) and the other representing the corresponding patterns (like letters). The function will check if the same elements map to the same patterns and vice versa.

Here's how we can implement this:

```python
def is_samepatterns(elements, patterns):
    if len(elements) != len(patterns):
        return False
    
    element_to_pattern = {}
    pattern_to_element = {}

    return True

# Test the function with the provided assertion
assert is_samepatterns([""red"", ""green"", ""green""], [""a"", ""b"", ""b""]) == True
```

### Explanation:
1. **Length Check**: First, we check if the lengths of the two lists are the same. If not, they cannot follow the same pattern.
2. **Mapping Creation**: We create two dictionaries:
   - `element_to_pattern` to map each unique element to its corresponding pattern.
   - `pattern_to_element` to map each unique pattern back to its corresponding element.
3. **Iteration**: We iterate through both lists simultaneously using `zip()`. For each pair of element and pattern:
   - We check if the element is already mapped to a pattern. If it is, we verify that it matches the current pattern.
   - We do the same for patterns, checking if they map back to the correct element.
4. **Return Result**: If all checks pass, we return `True`, indicating that the sequences follow the same pattern.

mbpp,Mbpp/286,SC-5,1,"To solve the problem of finding the largest sum of a contiguous subarray in a modified array formed by repeating a given array `k` times, we can utilize a combination of Kadane's algorithm and some mathematical insights about the properties of the array.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Kadane's Algorithm**: This algorithm helps us find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in a single pass through the array.

2. **Handling Repeats**: When the array is repeated `k` times, we need to consider:
   - The maximum subarray sum within a single instance of the array.
   - The possibility of the maximum subarray sum that crosses the boundaries of the repeated arrays.

3. **Crossing Boundaries**: To handle the case where the maximum sum crosses the boundary between two instances of the array, we can:
   - Calculate the maximum prefix sum (the maximum sum of a subarray that starts from the beginning of the array).
   - Calculate the maximum suffix sum (the maximum sum of a subarray that ends at the end of the array).
   - If `k` is greater than 1, we can also consider the total sum of the array multiplied by `(k - 2)` (if `k` is 2 or more) to account for the middle repetitions.

4. **Final Calculation**: The final maximum sum will be the maximum of:
   - The maximum subarray sum from a single instance of the array.
   - The maximum prefix sum plus the maximum suffix sum plus the total sum of the array multiplied by `(k - 2)` (if `k` is greater than 2).

2. **Binary Search**: We repeatedly calculate the middle index `mid` and compare the value at this index with the specified value:
   - If the value at `mid` is less than or equal to the specified value, we move the `low` pointer to `mid + 1` (searching in the right half).
   - If the value at `mid` is greater than the specified value, we move the `high` pointer to `mid` (searching in the left half).
3. **Termination**: The loop continues until `low` is no longer less than `high`. At this point, `low` will be the index where the specified value can be inserted to maintain sorted order.
4. **Return**: We return `low` as the insertion point.

mbpp,Mbpp/300,SC-5,1,"To solve the problem of counting binary sequences of length \(2n\) where the sum of the first \(n\) bits is equal to the sum of the last \(n\) bits, we can use combinatorial mathematics.

The key insight is that for a binary sequence of length \(2n\), if we denote the sum of the first \(n\) bits as \(k\), then the sum of the last \(n\) bits must also be \(k\). The number of ways to choose \(k\) bits from \(n\) bits is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{n}{k}\). 

Thus, the total number of valid sequences can be computed by summing the squares of the binomial coefficients for all possible values of \(k\) from \(0\) to \(n\):

\[
\text{count\_binary\_seq}(n) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k}^2
\]

This sum can also be computed using the identity:

\[
\sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k}^2 = \binom{2n}{n}
\]

This means that the count of valid binary sequences of length \(2n\) is given by \(\binom{2n}{n}\).

Here's how you can implement this in Python:

```python
import math

def count_binary_seq(n):
    # Calculate the binomial coefficient C(2n, n)
    return math.comb(2 * n, n)

# Test the function with the provided assertion
assert math.isclose(count_binary_seq(1), 2.0, rel_tol=0.001)
```

### Explanation:
- We use `math.comb` to compute the binomial coefficient \(\binom{2n}{n}\).
- The function `count_binary_seq` takes an integer \(n\) and returns the count of valid binary sequences of length \(2n\).
- The assertion checks if the function works correctly for \(n = 1\), which should return \(2\) (the sequences are `00` and `11`).

This code defines the function `amicable_numbers_sum` which calculates the sum of all amicable numbers up to a given limit.
