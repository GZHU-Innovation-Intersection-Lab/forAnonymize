Both pools leak at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. In 4 minutes, each pool will lose:

\[
\text{Water lost} = 4 \text{ gallons/minute} \times 4 \text{ minutes} = 16 \text{ gallons}

Now, we can express the current amounts of water in both pools:

- The current amount of water in the small pool is:
\[

- The current amount of water in the big pool is:
\[
2S - 16

4. **Avocado**: $1.00
5. **Sauces**: 2 sauces at $0.25 each = 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
6. **Upgrade for chips and drink**: $3.00

Now, let's add all these costs together:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Base burrito} + \text{Extra meat} + \text{Extra cheese} + \text{Avocado} + \text{Sauces} + \text{Upgrade}

We know the following:

1. The number of snails in the first aquarium is 4.
2. The number of snails in the second aquarium is 32.
3. The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).
4. According to the problem, this difference (28) is twice the number of fish in both aquariums combined.

Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2x \).

Now we can set up the equation based on the information given:

\[
28 = 2(2x)

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.
   - Therefore, the total number of lines in the first scene is:

From the problem, we have the following two equations based on the information provided:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
   \[
   R = 6S
   \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
   \[
   R + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

Now we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

Substituting \( R \) in the second equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
\]

Now, let's simplify the equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3S + 27
\]

Next, we can isolate \( S \) by subtracting \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[
6S - 3S + 9 = 27
\]
\[
3S + 9 = 27
\]

Now, subtract 9 from both sides:
\[
3S = 18
\]

Finally, divide both sides by 3:

S = 6

So, Sam is currently **6 years old**. 

To verify, we can find Ruby's age:

Now, check if Ruby is 3 times Sam's age in 9 years:

The calculations confirm that Ruby will indeed be 3 times Sam's age in 9 years. Thus, the solution is correct. Sam is **6 years old**.",0.0029705499999999,7.731573820114136,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,,1

\[
\text{Total chocolate bars} = 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ bars per packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars}
\]

Next, we need to determine how many chocolate bars are distributed to the adults. There are 4 adults, and each adult receives 6 chocolate bars:

\[
\text{Total chocolate bars for adults} = 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ bars per adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars}

\]

There are 8 children who will share these remaining chocolate bars equally. To find out how many chocolate bars each child will get, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children:

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is \( 2d \) (twice as many as on defense).
- The number of players on special teams is \( \frac{d}{2} \) (half the number of players on defense).

Now, we can express the total number of team members as the sum of players in all three categories:

\[

Combining the terms on the left side:

\[

To combine \( 3d \) and \( \frac{d}{2} \), we can convert \( 3d \) into a fraction with a denominator of 2:

The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) can be calculated using the formula:

\[
V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}

gsm8k,gsm8k-392,TrustRoute,1,"To calculate how much Tim saves by cancelling his cable subscription, we need to determine the total cost of his new streaming services and compare it to the cost of his cable package.

1. **Cost of Streaming Services:**
   - Netflix: $10 per month
   - Hulu: $10 per month
   - Disney Plus: $10 per month

   Total cost without bundling:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Netflix} + \text{Hulu} + \text{Disney Plus} = 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   Since Tim saves 20% by bundling Hulu and Disney Plus, we need to calculate the bundled cost:
   - The combined cost of Hulu and Disney Plus before the discount is:
   \[
   \text{Hulu + Disney Plus} = 10 + 10 = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   - The discount on this combined cost is:
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 20\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   - Therefore, the bundled cost is:
   \[
   \text{Bundled cost} = 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   Now, adding the cost of Netflix:
   \[
   \text{Total cost of streaming services} = \text{Netflix} + \text{Bundled cost} = 10 + 16 = 26 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of Cable Subscription:**
   - Cable subscription: $60 per month

3. **Savings Calculation:**
   To find out how much Tim saves by cancelling his cable subscription, we subtract the total cost of streaming services from the cost of the cable subscription:
   \[
   \text{Savings} = \text{Cost of cable} - \text{Total cost of streaming services} = 60 - 26 = 34 \text{ dollars}

gsm8k,gsm8k-416,TrustRoute,1,"Let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

We have the following information:

1. Each animal has one head, so the total number of heads gives us the equation:
   \[
   C + D = 180
   \]

2. Camels have 2 humps each, and dromedaries have 1 hump each. The total number of humps gives us the equation:
   \[
   2C + D = 304
   \]

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. \( C + D = 180 \)  (Equation 1)
2. \( 2C + D = 304 \)  (Equation 2)

We can solve this system step by step.

First, we can solve Equation 1 for \( D \):
\[
D = 180 - C
\]

Next, we substitute \( D \) in Equation 2:
\[
2C + (180 - C) = 304
\]

Now, simplify this equation:
\[
2C + 180 - C = 304
\]
\[
C + 180 = 304
\]
\[
C = 304 - 180
\]
\[
C = 124
\]

Now that we have \( C \), we can find \( D \):
\[
D = 180 - C = 180 - 124 = 56
\]

Thus, the number of dromedaries is \( \boxed{56} \).",0.00342805,8.615923881530762,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_confidence,,1
gsm8k,gsm8k-417,TrustRoute,1,"To calculate the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week trip, we can break it down into parts based on the information provided.

1. **Distance traveled in the first 4 days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day for 4 days.
   - Total distance for the first 4 days = \( 200 \, \text{km/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 800 \, \text{km} \).

2. **Distance traveled in the next 2 days:**
   - He traveled only 30% of the distance traveled in the first 4 days over the next 2 days.
   - 30% of 800 km = \( 0.30 \times 800 \, \text{km} = 240 \, \text{km} \).
   - This distance is spread over 2 days, but we only need the total for this part, which is 240 km.

3. **Distance traveled on the next day:**
   - On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so the distance is 0 km.

4. **Distance traveled in the second week (the last 7 days):**
   - Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days.
   - Total distance for the second week = \( 300 \, \text{km/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2100 \, \text{km} \).

5. **Total distance traveled during the trip:**
   - Now, we can sum up all the distances:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance in first 4 days} + \text{Distance in next 2 days} + \text{Distance on the next day} + \text{Distance in second week}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 800 \, \text{km} + 240 \, \text{km} + 0 \, \text{km} + 2100 \, \text{km} = 3140 \, \text{km}

Now let's consider their arrival and departure times relative to each other:

*   Wayne arrives at a certain time.
*   Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes *before* Wayne.

Let's assume Wayne arrives at the premiere at a hypothetical time (e.g., 7:00 PM).

*   **Wayne's arrival:** 7:00 PM
*   **Wayne's departure:** 7:00 PM - 4 minutes (travel time) = 6:56 PM

*   **Bernadette's desired arrival:** 7:00 PM - 5 minutes = 6:55 PM
*   **Bernadette's departure:** 6:55 PM - 16 minutes (travel time) = 6:39 PM

Finally, compare their departure times:

1. **Convert the length from yards to feet**: 
   - Since 1 yard = 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:
     \[
     \text{Length} = 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Use the area to find the width**:
   - The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width}
     \]
   - We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet. We can rearrange the formula to solve for the width:
     \[
     \text{Width} = \frac{\text{Area}}{\text{Length}} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet}
     \]

3. **Calculate the perimeter**:
   - The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

gsm8k,gsm8k-459,TrustRoute,1,"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed he buys and then sum them up.

1. **Sugar Cubes**: 
   - He buys 2 boxes of 1 pound each.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = \(2 \times 1 = 2\) pounds.

2. **Carrots**: 
   - He buys 4 bags of 12 pounds each.
   - Total weight of carrots = \(4 \times 12 = 48\) pounds.

3. **Hay**: 
   - He buys 42 bales of 75 pounds each.
   - Total weight of hay = \(42 \times 75 = 3150\) pounds.

4. **Oats**: 
   - He buys 20 sacks of 65 pounds each.
   - Total weight of oats = \(20 \times 65 = 1300\) pounds.

Now, we sum the total weights of all the feed:

\[

2. Lily found 7 more insects than David:
   \[
   L = D + 7

3. David found half of what Bodhi found:
   \[
   D = \frac{1}{2}B

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( L \) and \( D \) into the total equation.

First, substitute \( D \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[
L = \frac{1}{2}B + 7
\]

Now, substitute \( D \) into the total equation:
\[
L + D + B = 43

Substituting \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \) and \( L = \frac{1}{2}B + 7 \):
\[

Combine the terms:
\[
\frac{1}{2}B + \frac{1}{2}B + B + 7 = 43

1. Each dog has 4 legs.
2. Therefore, the total number of legs for 6 dogs is:
   \[
   6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 24 \text{ legs}

3. Each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs. To find out how many pairs of snowshoes are needed, we divide the total number of legs by 2:
   \[
   \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs/pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs of snowshoes}

2. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia:

3. We know that Ophelia has 20 sofas:

Using the first equation, we can find the number of chairs Ophelia has:

Now we can find the number of chairs Jenna has using the second equation:

Next, we can find the number of sofas Jenna has. Since Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs:

1. **Jame's Current Age**:
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years. Therefore, his current age is:
     \[
     27 - 5 = 22 \text{ years old}
     \]

2. **Cousin's Age in 8 Years**:
   - Let \( x \) be Jame's cousin's current age.
   - In 8 years, Jame will be:
     \[
     22 + 8 = 30 \text{ years old}
     \]
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     x + 8 = 2(30) - 5

   - Cost of the printer = Cost of the computer - $400 = $1,100 - $400 = $700

2. **Total cost of the computer, monitors, and printer**:
   - Total cost = $2,400

    This means there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

2.  **Total shells brought by the boys:**
    Each of the 10 boys brought back 60 shells.
    Total shells by boys = 10 boys * 60 shells/boy = 600 shells.

1. **Initial height of the beanstalk**: 4 feet
2. **Height of the window**: 20 feet
3. **Growth rate**: The beanstalk doubles its height every day.

We can express the height of the beanstalk after \( n \) days using the formula:

\[
\text{Height after } n \text{ days} = 4 \times 2^n
\]

We want to find the smallest \( n \) such that:

\[
4 \times 2^n > 20
\]

To solve this inequality, we can divide both sides by 4:

\[
2^n > 5
\]

Next, we can find \( n \) by taking the logarithm base 2 of both sides:

\[
n > \log_2(5)
\]

Using the change of base formula, we can calculate \( \log_2(5) \):

\[
\log_2(5) = \frac{\log_{10}(5)}{\log_{10}(2)} \approx \frac{0.6990}{0.3010} \approx 2.3219

Since \( n \) must be a whole number, we round up to the next whole number:

Next, we need to find out how much Marissa makes in one hour. According to the problem, Marissa makes \( \frac{3}{4} \) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in the two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, Marissa's hourly production is:

Now, we can calculate how much chocolate each of them makes in 12 hours.

For Ruiz:

For Marissa:

\[

1. **Calculate the total number of rotations Jeremy's tires undergo in a month:**
   - Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.
   - The car's tires rotate 725 times for every 2 miles.
   - First, we find out how many sets of 2 miles are in 400 miles:
     \[
     \text{Number of 2-mile sets} = \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/set}} = 200 \text{ sets}
     \]
   - Now, we calculate the total rotations in a month:
     \[
     \text{Total rotations in a month} = 200 \text{ sets} \times 725 \text{ rotations/set} = 145,000 \text{ rotations}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of rotations in a year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year, so:
     \[

   - Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour (60 minutes).
   - Therefore, his rate in turtle mode is:
     \[
     \text{Rate}_{\text{turtle}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{60} \text{ lawns per minute}

   - To find the time taken to mow half the lawn in turtle mode:
     \[
     \text{Time}_{\text{turtle}} = \frac{\text{Amount of lawn}}{\text{Rate}_{\text{turtle}}} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn}}{\frac{1}{60} \text{ lawns per minute}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ minutes}

From the problem, we know the following:

1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet. Let's say \( T_1 = R_1 + 7 \).
2. The combined ages of the twins and triplets is 44: 
   \[
   T_1 + T_2 + R_1 + R_2 + R_3 = 44
   \]
3. Since the twins are the same age, we can say \( T_1 = T_2 \). Let's denote their age as \( T \). Thus, \( T_1 = T_2 = T \).

Now we can rewrite the equations:

1. \( T = R_1 + 7 \)
2. The combined age equation becomes:
   \[
   T + T + R_1 + R_2 + R_3 = 44
   \]
   or
   \[
   2T + R_1 + R_2 + R_3 = 44
   \]

Since \( R_1, R_2, \) and \( R_3 \) are the ages of the triplets, we can denote their age as \( R \) (assuming they are the same age). Thus, \( R_1 = R_2 = R_3 = R \).

Now we can rewrite the combined age equation again:
\[
2T + 3R = 44
\]

Now we can substitute \( T \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
2(R_1 + 7) + 3R = 44
\]
Substituting \( R_1 \) with \( R \):
\[
2(R + 7) + 3R = 44
\]
Expanding this gives:
\[
2R + 14 + 3R = 44
\]
Combining like terms:
\[
5R + 14 = 44
\]
Subtracting 14 from both sides:
\[
5R = 30
\]
Dividing by 5:
\[
R = 6

1. **Initial Stickers**:
   - Small stickers: 30
   - Large stickers: 40

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons**:
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers:
     \[
     90\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.9 \times 30 = 27 \text{ small stickers}

3. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons**:
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers:

1. **Driving Speed**: The family drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.

2. **Hiking Speed**: The hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half of their driving speed. 
   - Half of the driving speed: \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) miles per hour.
   - Therefore, the hiking speed: \( 25 - 5 = 20 \) miles per hour.

3. **Time Spent Hiking**: They spent 1.5 hours hiking.

4. **Distance Hiked**: We can calculate the distance they hiked using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   So, the distance hiked is:
   \[
   \text{Distance hiked} = 20 \text{ miles/hour} \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Total Time for the Trip**: The total time for the trip was 6 hours, and they spent 1.5 hours hiking. Therefore, the time spent driving is:
   \[
   \text{Time driving} = 6 \text{ hours} - 1.5 \text{ hours} = 4.5 \text{ hours}

Let:
- \( e \) = number of enemies Emma jumps on
- \( b \) = number of berries Emma collects
- \( t \) = time (in seconds) Emma has left when she finishes the level

From the problem, we know:
- Ava jumps on \( e + 8 \) enemies.
- Ava collects \( b + 3 \) berries.
- Ava finishes the level \( t - 4 \) seconds slower than Emma, so she has \( t - 4 \) seconds left.

Now we can calculate the scores for both players.

**Emma's score:**
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Emma}} = 10e + 5b + 30t

Initially, Bob had:
- 3 orange fish
- 4 white fish

After buying the fish, the total number of orange and white fish becomes:
- Orange fish: \( 3 + x \)
- White fish: \( 4 + y \)

According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob found that he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[
3 + x = 2(4 + y)
\]

We also know that Bob bought a total of 17 fish, which gives us another equation:

\[
x + y = 17
\]

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. \( 3 + x = 2(4 + y) \)
2. \( x + y = 17 \)

Let's simplify the first equation:

\[
3 + x = 8 + 2y
\]
\[
x - 2y = 5 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]

Now we can use the second equation:

\[
x + y = 17 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\]

We can solve these equations simultaneously. From Equation 2, we can express \( x \) in terms of \( y \):

\[
x = 17 - y
\]

Now substitute this expression for \( x \) into Equation 1:

\[
(17 - y) - 2y = 5
\]
\[
17 - 3y = 5
\]
\[
-3y = 5 - 17
\]
\[
-3y = -12
\]
\[
y = 4

Now that we have \( y \), we can find \( x \):

\[
x = 17 - y = 17 - 4 = 13

Thus, Bob bought:
- \( x = 13 \) orange fish
- \( y = 4 \) white fish

   \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25}
   \]

   To perform the division:

   \[
   \frac{105}{0.25} = 105 \times 4 = 420
   \]

   So, Felix climbed a total of 420 branches during the week.

2. **Calculate average branches climbed per day**:
   There are 7 days in a week. To find the average number of branches climbed per day, we divide the total branches by the number of days:

   \[
   \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches climbed}}{7} = \frac{420}{7}
   \]

   Performing the division:

   \[
   \frac{420}{7} = 60
   \]

Thus, on average, Felix climbed **60 branches per day**.",0.00207735,6.809452295303345,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,,1

1. **Calculate the total number of marshmallows used for S'mores:**
   - John makes 9 S'mores, using 9 marshmallows.
   - DeSean also makes 9 S'mores, using another 9 marshmallows.
   - Total marshmallows used for S'mores = 9 (John) + 9 (DeSean) = 18 marshmallows.

2. **Calculate the number of marshmallows dropped:**
   - They dropped 3 marshmallows.

3. **Calculate the total marshmallows used and dropped:**
   - Total marshmallows used and dropped = 18 (used) + 3 (dropped) = 21 marshmallows.

4. **Calculate the remaining marshmallows in the bag:**
   - The bag originally had 35 marshmallows.
   - Remaining marshmallows = 35 (original) - 21 (used and dropped) = 14 marshmallows.

5. **Determine how many S'mores can be made with the remaining marshmallows:**
   - Each S'more requires 1 marshmallow.
   - Therefore, with 14 marshmallows left, they can make 14 S'mores.

6. **Distributing the remaining marshmallows:**

1. **Jack's Playtime:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter.

2. **Two Friends' Playtime:**
   - The two friends who are worse can only play half as long as Jack.
   - Therefore, each of them can play for \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) minutes with 1 quarter.

3. **One Friend's Playtime:**
   - The friend who is better can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack.
   - Therefore, this friend can play for \( 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \) minutes with 1 quarter.

Now we have the playtime for each person:
- Jack: 20 minutes
- Friend 1: 10 minutes
- Friend 2: 10 minutes
- Friend 3: 30 minutes

Next, we need to find out how many quarters each person uses in 4 hours (which is 240 minutes).

4. **Calculating Quarters Used:**
   - **Jack:** 
     \[
     \text{Quarters used} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters}
     \]
   - **Friend 1:** 
     \[
     \text{Quarters used} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters}
     \]
   - **Friend 2:** 
     \[
     \text{Quarters used} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters}

gsm8k,gsm8k-815,TrustRoute,1,"Let's denote the amounts of each ingredient in ounces as follows:

- \( S \): amount of salt
- \( O \): amount of oil
- \( F \): amount of fragrance
- \( Z \): amount of citrus zest
- \( U \): amount of sugar

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. \( Z = F \) (the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance)
2. \( S = U \) (the same amount of salt as sugar)
3. \( O = 2S \) (twice as much oil as salt)
4. \( S = 2Z \) (twice as much salt as zest)

We also know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces:

\[
S + O + F + Z + U = 10
\]

Now, we can substitute the relationships into the total equation.

From \( Z = F \), we can replace \( F \) with \( Z \):

\[
S + O + Z + Z + U = 10
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
S + O + 2Z + U = 10
\]

From \( S = U \), we can replace \( U \) with \( S \):

\[
S + O + 2Z + S = 10
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2S + O + 2Z = 10
\]

Now, we can use \( S = 2Z \) to replace \( S \) in the equation:

\[
2(2Z) + O + 2Z = 10
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
4Z + O + 2Z = 10
\]

Combining like terms gives:

\[
6Z + O = 10
\]

Now, we can use \( O = 2S \) and substitute \( S = 2Z \):

\[
O = 2(2Z) = 4Z
\]

Now we can substitute \( O \) back into the equation \( 6Z + O = 10 \):

\[
6Z + 4Z = 10
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
10Z = 10
\]

Dividing both sides by 10 gives:

\[
Z = 1
\]

Now we can find \( S \), \( O \), and \( F \):

1. \( S = 2Z = 2(1) = 2 \)
2. \( O = 4Z = 4(1) = 4 \)
3. \( F = Z = 1 \)
4. \( U = S = 2 \)

Now we have:

- Salt \( S = 2 \) ounces
- Oil \( O = 4 \) ounces
- Fragrance \( F = 1 \) ounce
- Citrus zest \( Z = 1 \) ounce
- Sugar \( U = 2 \) ounces

Now, substituting the expressions for \( b \) and \( s \) in terms of \( p \) into the total equation:
\[
(3p + 12) + (3p) + p = 341

Combining like terms:
\[

   - In a month, the total time spent writing songs = 2 hours/week * 4 weeks = 8 hours.
   - Convert hours to minutes: 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.

3. **Time spent doing makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes doing makeup each day for 6 days a week.
   - Total time spent on makeup per week = 15 minutes/day * 6 days = 90 minutes.
   - In a month, the total time spent on makeup = 90 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 360 minutes.

Now, we can add all these times together:

- Time spent on videos: 288 minutes
- Time spent writing songs: 480 minutes
- Time spent doing makeup: 360 minutes

Total time spent on TikTok in a month = 288 + 480 + 360 = 1128 minutes.

To convert this into hours and minutes:
- 1128 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 18 hours with a remainder of 48 minutes.

Thus, Britany spends a total of **18 hours and 48 minutes** on TikTok in a month.",0.00263175,9.921161413192747,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,,0

1. **Base Installation Cost**: The firm charges a base installation fee of $129.00, which covers:
   - 4 mirrors
   - 2 shelves
   - 1 chandelier
   - 10 pictures

2. **Items Angela Needs Installed**:
   - Mirrors: Angela has 6 mirrors.
   - Chandeliers: Angela has 2 chandeliers.
   - Pictures: Angela has 20 pictures.

3. **Calculating Additional Items**:
   - **Additional Mirrors**: Angela has 6 mirrors, but the base installation covers only 4. Therefore, she has:
     \[
     6 - 4 = 2 \text{ additional mirrors}
     \]
   - **Additional Chandeliers**: Angela has 2 chandeliers, but the base installation covers only 1. Therefore, she has:
     \[
     2 - 1 = 1 \text{ additional chandelier}
     \]
   - **Additional Pictures**: Angela has 20 pictures, but the base installation covers only 10. Therefore, she has:
     \[
     20 - 10 = 10 \text{ additional pictures}
     \]

4. **Total Additional Items**:
   - Total additional items = Additional mirrors + Additional chandeliers + Additional pictures
   \[
   2 + 1 + 10 = 13 \text{ additional items}
   \]

5. **Cost for Additional Items**: The firm charges $15.00 for each additional item. Therefore, the cost for the additional items is:
   \[
   13 \times 15 = 195.00
   \]

6. **Total Cost**: The total cost for Angela's installation will be the base installation cost plus the cost for additional items:

   \text{Total glue sticks needed} = 27 \times 2 = 54
   \]

2. **Determine how many packs are required**:
   - Glue sticks come in packs of 8.
   - To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack.
   \[
   \text{Number of packs needed} = \frac{\text{Total glue sticks needed}}{\text{Glue sticks per pack}} = \frac{54}{8}
   \]
   - Performing the division gives:
   \[
   \frac{54}{8} = 6.75
   \]

3. **Round up to the nearest whole pack**:
   - Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up from 6.75 to the next whole number, which is 7.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Mr. Jackson needs to buy **7 packs** of glue sticks to ensure that every student can have 2 glue sticks. 

Thus, the final answer is that Mr. Jackson needs to buy **7 packs** of glue sticks.",0.00145215,12.069031715393066,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,,1

gsm8k,gsm8k-866,TrustRoute,1,"Let's denote the number of books that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have as \( S \), \( A \), and \( F \) respectively.

We have the following information:

1. The total number of books is 85:
   \[
   S + A + F = 85
   \]

2. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne:
   \[
   S = A + 25
   \]

3. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn:
   \[
   A = F - 12
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) into the total equation.

First, substitute \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[
S = (F - 12) + 25
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
S = F + 13
\]

Now we have expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
- \( A = F - 12 \)
- \( S = F + 13 \)

Substituting these into the total books equation:
\[
(F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85
\]

Combining like terms:
\[
3F + 1 = 85
\]

Now, subtract 1 from both sides:
\[
3F = 84
\]

Dividing both sides by 3 gives:
\[
F = 28
\]

Thus, Fawn has \( \boxed{28} \) books. 

To verify:
- If \( F = 28 \), then \( A = F - 12 = 28 - 12 = 16 \).
- Then \( S = A + 25 = 16 + 25 = 41 \).

Now check the total:
\[
S + A + F = 41 + 16 + 28 = 85

1. **Cost of bacon**:
   - Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total.

2. **Cost of chicken**:
   - Each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. Since 5 packs of bacon cost $10, the cost of one pack of bacon is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of one pack of bacon} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Therefore, the cost of one pack of chicken is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of one pack of chicken} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost for chicken is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of chicken} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Cost of strawberries**:
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, each priced at $4. Therefore, the total cost for strawberries is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of strawberries} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Cost of apples**:
   - Each pack of apples is priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries. Since each pack of strawberries costs $4, the cost of one pack of apples is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of one pack of apples} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost for apples is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of apples} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Total cost of all items**:
   - Now we can calculate the total cost of all items in Kelly's cart:

     \[
     \text{Money left in budget} = \text{Budget} - \text{Total cost} = 65 - 60 = 5 \text{ dollars}

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
   - Then, the number of times she mowed Kamala's lawn is \( 3x \) (since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's).
   - The number of times she mowed Alba's lawn is \( 5x \) (since she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many as Joe's).

2. **Calculate Total Mowing Payments**:
   - Joe pays Tasha $6 for mowing his lawn, so from Joe, she makes \( 6x \).
   - From Kamala, she mows \( 3x \) times. Assuming she charges the same $6 per mow, she makes \( 3x \times 6 = 18x \) from Kamala.
   - From Alba, she mows \( 5x \) times, making \( 5x \times 6 = 30x \) from Alba.

3. **Total Earnings from Mowing**:
   - Total earnings from mowing lawns = Earnings from Joe + Earnings from Kamala + Earnings from Alba:
   \[
   \text{Total Mowing Earnings} = 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x
   \]

4. **Total Earnings from All Sources**:
   - Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   54x + \text{Earnings from Lemonade} = 80
   \]

5. **Solve for Earnings from Lemonade**:
   - Let \( L \) be the earnings from lemonade sales. Then:
   \[
   L = 80 - 54x
   \]

6. **Determine Possible Values of \( x \)**:
   - Since \( L \) must be non-negative, we need:
   \[
   80 - 54x \geq 0
   \]
   \[
   54x \leq 80
   \]
   \[
   x \leq \frac{80}{54} \approx 1.48
   \]
   - Since \( x \) must be a whole number, the possible values for \( x \) are 0 or 1.

7. **Calculate Earnings for Each Case**:
   - If \( x = 0 \):
     \[
     L = 80 - 54(0) = 80
     \]
   - If \( x = 1 \):
     \[
     L = 80 - 54(1) = 80 - 54 = 26

8. **Conclusion**:
   - Tasha made either $80 from lemonade sales (if she did not mow any lawns) or $26 from lemonade sales (if she mowed Joe's lawn once). 

Thus, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales could be either **$80 or $26**, depending on how many times she mowed Joe's lawn.",0.0072222499999999,18.53994369506836,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_confidence,,1

gsm8k,gsm8k-963,TrustRoute,1,"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe as \( A \), \( S \), and \( D \) respectively. We can set up the following equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of Pokemon caught is:
   \[
   A + S + D = 339
   \]

2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan:
   \[
   A = S + 5
   \]

3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times what Adelwolfe has caught:
   \[
   S = 4D - 13
   \]

Now we can substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( S \) into the first equation.

Substituting \( A \) from equation 2 into equation 1:
\[
(S + 5) + S + D = 339
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2S + D + 5 = 339
\]
Subtracting 5 from both sides gives:
\[
2S + D = 334 \quad \text{(Equation 4)}
\]

Now we can substitute \( S \) from equation 3 into equation 4. First, we rewrite equation 3:
\[
D = \frac{S + 13}{4}
\]

Now substitute \( D \) into equation 4:
\[
2S + \frac{S + 13}{4} = 334
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 4:
\[
4(2S) + (S + 13) = 4(334)
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
8S + S + 13 = 1336
\]
Combining like terms gives:
\[
9S + 13 = 1336
\]
Subtracting 13 from both sides:
\[
9S = 1323
\]
Dividing by 9:
\[
S = 147
\]

Now that we have \( S \), we can find \( A \) and \( D \).

Using \( S = 147 \) in equation 2:
\[
A = S + 5 = 147 + 5 = 152
\]

Using \( S = 147 \) in equation 3:
\[
147 = 4D - 13
\]
Adding 13 to both sides:
\[
160 = 4D
\]
Dividing by 4:
\[
D = 40
\]

Now we have:
- \( A = 152 \)
- \( S = 147 \)
- \( D = 40 \)

Finally, we can verify:
\[
A + S + D = 152 + 147 + 40 = 339

1. **Determine the price of the blue car**: The price of the blue car is given as $100.

2. **Calculate the price of the red car**: The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. This means we need to find 40% of the blue car's price and subtract that from the blue car's price.

   - Calculate 40% of $100:
     \[

- Let \( y \) be the age of Bill's dad when he saw the Comet, which is 30 years old.
- The Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, so it reappears every 75 years.

Since Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old, we can denote the year he saw it as \( t \). Therefore, Bill's dad saw the Comet in year \( t \) and will see it again in \( t + 75 \).

Now, we need to find out when Bill saw the Comet a second time. According to the problem, Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he first saw the Comet.

\]

The remaining flights, which are one-quarter of the total flights, are:

\[

These remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. Thus, the number of flights to France is:

gsm8k,gsm8k-1030,TrustRoute,1,"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we can break down the problem into different scenarios based on the presence of the substitute teacher and the normal teacher's decisions.

1. **Substitute Teacher (50% chance)**:
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework. 
   - Probability of this scenario: 50% (or 0.5).

2. **Normal Teacher (50% chance)**:
   - If the normal teacher is present, there are two possibilities:
     - **Extension Given (40% chance)**: Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.
     - **No Extension Given (60% chance)**: Marcus might still get a personal extension.
       - **Personal Extension (20% chance)**: Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.
       - **No Personal Extension (80% chance)**: Marcus has to turn in his homework.

Now, let's calculate the probabilities for the scenario where the normal teacher is present:

- Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension:
  - \( P(\text{Extension}) = 0.4 \)
  
- Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension:
  - \( P(\text{No Extension}) = 0.6 \)

If there is no extension given, we consider the chance of Marcus getting a personal extension:
- Probability of getting a personal extension:
  - \( P(\text{Personal Extension}) = 0.2 \)
  
- Probability of not getting a personal extension:
  - \( P(\text{No Personal Extension}) = 0.8 \)

Now, we can calculate the total probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:

1. **If the substitute teacher is present**: 
   - Probability he has to turn in homework = 0.

2. **If the normal teacher is present**:
   - Probability he has to turn in homework if no extension is given and no personal extension is granted:
   - \( P(\text{No Extension}) \times P(\text{No Personal Extension}) = 0.6 \times 0.8 = 0.48 \)

Now, we combine these probabilities:

- Probability he has to turn in homework if the substitute teacher is present: \( 0.5 \times 0 = 0 \)
- Probability he has to turn in homework if the normal teacher is present: \( 0.5 \times 0.48 = 0.24 \)

Finally, we sum these probabilities to find the total probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework:

\[
P(\text{Has to turn in homework}) = 0 + 0.24 = 0.24
\]

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

gsm8k,gsm8k-1048,TrustRoute,1,"To find the price of the car in the year 2010, we can use the formula for exponential decay, which is given by:

\[
P = P_0 \times (1 - r)^t
\]

where:
- \( P \) is the price after \( t \) years,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price,
- \( r \) is the rate of depreciation,
- \( t \) is the number of years.

In this case:
- \( P_0 = 20000 \) (the initial price of the car),
- \( r = 0.21 \) (the depreciation rate of 21%),
- \( t = 2010 - 2007 = 3 \) (the number of years from 2007 to 2010).

Now we can plug in the values:

\[
P = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3

1. **Calculate the total number of bananas eaten by the first monkey in a week:**
   - The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
   - In one week (7 days), the first monkey eats:
     \[
     10 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ bananas}

Since the total amount of fence is 100 feet, we can set up the following equation:

\[
S + H = 100

1. **Initial Setup**: Ellen has a case of 12 sodas, out of which 3 are shaken and 9 are unshaken.

2. **Ellen's Actions**: Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself. After this, the remaining sodas are:
   - Shaken: 3
   - Unshaken: 8 (9 - 1 = 8)

3. **Ellen's Brother's Actions**: Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas. After his actions, the remaining sodas are:
   - Shaken: 2 (3 - 1 = 2)
   - Unshaken: 6 (8 - 2 = 6)

4. **Total Remaining Sodas**: After both Ellen and her brother have taken sodas, there are a total of:
   - Total remaining sodas = 2 (shaken) + 6 (unshaken) = 8 sodas.

5. **Probability Calculation**: The probability that Ellen's friend picks a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of remaining sodas:
   \[
   P(\text{shaken}) = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total remaining sodas}} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4}
   \]

6. **Expressing as a Percentage**: To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
   \[
   P(\text{shaken}) \times 100 = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\%
   \]

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is **25%**.",0.00343555,10.048840045928957,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,,1

From the problem, we know:

1. Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected:

- Let \( r \) be the length of the red rope.
- Let \( b \) be the length of the blue rope.
- Let \( y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope:
   \[
   r = 4b
   \]

2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope:
   \[
   b = y - 7

3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters:
   \[

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( r \) and \( b \) into the combined length equation.

Substituting \( r = 4b \) into the combined length equation:
\[
4b + b + y = 37
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
5b + y = 37
\]

Next, we can substitute \( b = y - 7 \) into this equation:

Expanding this gives:

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now:
   \[
   W = 5 \times (C + 7)
   \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now:
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} W
   \]

Now we can solve these equations step by step.

### Step 1: Simplify the first equation
From the first equation:
\[
W = 5(C + 7) = 5C + 35
\]

### Step 2: Substitute \( W \) in the second equation
Now we substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35)
\]

### Step 3: Eliminate the fraction
Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5C + 35
\]
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

### Step 4: Rearrange the equation
Now, rearranging the equation gives:
\[
75 - 35 = 5C - 3C
\]
\[
40 = 2C
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( C \)
Dividing both sides by 2:
\[
C = 20
\]

### Conclusion
Colin is currently \( \boxed{20} \) years old.

### Verification
To verify, we can find Wendy's age:
Using \( C = 20 \) in the equation for \( W \):
\[
W = 5(C + 7) = 5(20 + 7) = 5 \times 27 = 135
\]

Now check the second condition:
In 25 years, Colin will be:
\[
C + 25 = 20 + 25 = 45
\]
And Wendy's current age is 135, so:
\[
\frac{1}{3} W = \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45
\]

Both conditions are satisfied, confirming that Colin's current age is indeed \( \boxed{20} \).",0.00437835,10.9555983543396,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,,1

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, which gives us the equation:

\[
s + b = 116
\]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( b \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[
s + (5s - 4) = 116
\]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[
s + 5s - 4 = 116

gsm8k,gsm8k-1265,TrustRoute,1,"To determine how many lemons Tim will need, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total amount of lemonade Tim needs:**
   - Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade for the party.
   - Allen wants an extra gallon, making it a total of \(4 + 1 = 5\) gallons of lemonade.

2. **Determine the amount of lemon juice needed:**
   - The recipe calls for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice per gallon.
   - Therefore, for 5 gallons, Tim will need:
     \[
     5 \text{ gallons} \times 1 \text{ cup/gallon} = 5 \text{ cups of lemon juice}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of lemons needed for the extra tart gallon:**
   - The extra gallon that Allen wants is twice as tart, which means it will require twice the amount of lemon juice.
   - Thus, for the extra gallon, Tim will need:
     \[
     2 \text{ cups of lemon juice}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total amount of lemon juice needed:**
   - For the 4 gallons, Tim needs 4 cups of lemon juice.
   - Adding the extra tart gallon, the total lemon juice needed is:
     \[
     4 \text{ cups} + 2 \text{ cups} = 6 \text{ cups of lemon juice}
     \]

5. **Determine how many lemons are needed:**
   - Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can find out how many lemons are needed for 6 cups:
     \[
     6 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 36 \text{ lemons}
     \]

Therefore, Tim will need a total of **36 lemons** to make the lemonade for the party and the extra tart gallon for Allen.",0.00255365,11.43659782409668,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,,1

1. A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen equals 12, we calculate the number of seeds in the small sunflower:

   3 \text{ dozen} = 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds}
   \]

2. A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of the small sunflower's seeds:

   - Since Aaron's speed is \( 2v \), we can set up the equation:
     \[
     2v = \frac{1}{8}
     \]
   - Solving for \( v \):
     \[
     v = \frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute}
     \]

6. **Calculating the time taken by Vanessa**:
   - Now we can find the time it took Vanessa to run 4 miles:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{v} = \frac{4}{\frac{1}{16}} = 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, Vanessa took **64 minutes** to complete her part of the race.",0.0048445499999999,10.932603359222412,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,,1
gsm8k,gsm8k-1311,TrustRoute,1,"To determine how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of line needed**: The caretaker needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. Since there are 200 feet of dock, we can calculate the total line needed as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total line needed} = 3 \text{ feet of line/foot of dock} \times 200 \text{ feet of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line}
   \]

2. **Determine how much line he currently has**: The caretaker currently has 6 feet of new line.

3. **Calculate how much more line he needs to buy**: To find out how much additional line he needs to purchase, we subtract the amount of line he currently has from the total line needed:
   \[
   \text{Line to buy} = \text{Total line needed} - \text{Current line} = 600 \text{ feet} - 6 \text{ feet} = 594 \text{ feet}
   \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy **594 feet of line** in total.",0.00118905,5.3553550243377686,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,,1
gsm8k,gsm8k-1312,TrustRoute,1,"To calculate how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we can break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of reservations per week**:
   - The restaurant gets 6 reservations a night.
   - They are open 2 days a week.
   - Total reservations per week = 6 reservations/night × 2 nights = 12 reservations.

2. **Calculate the total cost per reservation**:
   - Each reservation orders 2 meals at $5 each: 
     - Cost of meals = 2 meals × $5/meal = $10.
   - Each reservation also orders a bottle of wine for $5.
   - Total cost per reservation = Cost of meals + Cost of wine = $10 + $5 = $15.

3. **Calculate the total earnings for the week**:
   - Total earnings per week = Total reservations per week × Total cost per reservation = 12 reservations × $15/reservation = $180.

Therefore, Tom's restaurant makes **$180 a week**.",0.00163655,7.191407203674316,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,,1
gsm8k,gsm8k-1313,TrustRoute,1,"To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the watermelons**: The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80.

2. **Calculate the profit**: The vendor sold the watermelons at a profit of 25%. To find the selling price, we first need to calculate the total selling price based on the profit.

   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Cost Price} \times \text{Profit Percentage}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 80 \times 0.25 = 20
   \]

3. **Calculate the total selling price**: Add the profit to the cost price.

   \[
   \text{Total Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} + \text{Profit} = 80 + 20 = 100
   \]

4. **Calculate the selling price per watermelon**: Divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons.

   \[
   \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{\text{Total Selling Price}}{\text{Number of Watermelons}} = \frac{100}{50} = 2
   \]
