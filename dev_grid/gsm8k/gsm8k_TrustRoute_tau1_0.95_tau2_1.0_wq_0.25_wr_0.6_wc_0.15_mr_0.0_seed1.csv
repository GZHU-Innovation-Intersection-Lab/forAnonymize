1. **Calculate the total investment**: This includes the purchase price of the house and the cost of repairs.
   \[
   \text{Total Investment} = \text{Purchase Price} + \text{Repair Costs} = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the increased value of the house**: The value of the house increased by 150%. To find the new value, we first calculate 150% of the original purchase price.
   \[
   \text{Increase in Value} = 150\% \times \text{Purchase Price} = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000
   \]
   Now, we add this increase to the original purchase price to find the new value of the house.
   \[
   \text{New Value of the House} = \text{Purchase Price} + \text{Increase in Value} = 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000

3. **Calculate the profit**: Profit is calculated by subtracting the total investment from the new value of the house.
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{New Value of the House} - \text{Total Investment} = 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000

     \[
     \text{Pounds of beeswax} = \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds}

2. **Calculate the total cost of supplies**:
   - Each pound of beeswax and wicks costs $10.00. Therefore, for 2 pounds:

   She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday.  
   The number of articles written on Tuesday is:

   The number of articles written on Wednesday is:

1.  **Determine the full pension value:** If Marcy works for 40 years, her full annual pension is $50,000.

2.  **Determine when entitlement begins:** She starts becoming entitled to a percentage of the pension after 20 years.

3.  **Calculate the number of years she accrues pension value:** She quits after 30 years. Since entitlement starts after 20 years, she accrues pension for:
    30 years (total worked) - 20 years (entitlement start) = 10 years.

gsm8k,gsm8k-93,TrustRoute,1,"To determine how fast Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles with his improved diet, let's reason through the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the original relationship
- We are told that Lee used to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald.
- Lee's current time is given as 38 seconds. Assuming this is the same as his original time (since there's no indication that Lee's time has changed), Lee's original time was 38 seconds.
- Therefore, Gerald's original time was 2 seconds slower than Lee's original time:
  \[
  \text{Gerald's original time} = \text{Lee's original time} + 2 = 38 + 2 = 40 \text{ seconds}.
  \]

### Step 2: Account for Gerald's improvement
- Gerald improved his speed by 10%. Speed and time are inversely related for a fixed distance (like the 400 meters).
- If Gerald's speed increases by 10%, his new speed is 110% of his original speed, or 1.1 times the original.
- Time is inversely proportional to speed, so Gerald's new time is his original time divided by 1.1:
  \[
  \text{Gerald's new time} = \frac{\text{Gerald's original time}}{1.1} = \frac{40}{1.1}.
  \]

### Step 3: Perform the calculation
- First, express the division:
  \[
  \frac{40}{1.1} = \frac{40}{\frac{11}{10}} = 40 \times \frac{10}{11} = \frac{400}{11}.
  \]
- Now, calculate the exact value:
  \[
  \frac{400}{11} \approx 36.3636 \text{ seconds}.
  \]
- For precision, we can leave it as a fraction or approximate to two decimal places (common for track times).

### Final Answer:
Gerald, with his improved diet, can run the 400-meter hurdles in approximately **36.36 seconds**. For exactness, this is \(\frac{400}{11}\) seconds.",0.0038138399999999998,27.36506223678589,0,0,cand-grok-3-mini,stage2_confidence,

- Adrien's salary 4 years ago: $40,000
- Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's (4 years ago)
- Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%
- Both salaries increased simultaneously (by the same percentage)

**Step 1: Find Lylah's salary 4 years ago**

If Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's:
- Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary × 1.30
- $40,000 = Lylah's salary × 1.30
- Lylah's salary = $40,000 ÷ 1.30
- Lylah's salary = $30,769.23 (approximately)

**Step 2: Find Adrien's salary four years later**

Adrien's salary increased by 40%:
- New salary = $40,000 × 1.40
- New salary = $56,000

**Step 3: Find Lylah's salary four years later**

Since both salaries increased simultaneously (by the same 40%):
- Lylah's new salary = $30,769.23 × 1.40
- Lylah's new salary = $43,076.92 (approximately)

**Step 4: Calculate total salary four years later**

Total = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
Total = $56,000 + $43,076.92
Total = $99,076.92

**Answer: $99,076.92** (or approximately $99,077)

Alternatively, using exact fractions:
- Lylah's original salary = $40,000/1.3 = $400,000/13
- Total after increase = ($40,000 + $400,000/13) × 1.4 = $920,000/13 × 1.4 = $1,288,000/13 ≈ **$99,076.92**",0.01996575,24.611982583999634,0,0,cand-claude-sonnet-4-5,stage2_confidence,

gsm8k,gsm8k-141,TrustRoute,1,"Let's define the number of each type of bee in the hive:

- Let \( q \) be the number of queen bees.
- Then the number of baby bees \( b \) is \( 2q \) (since there are twice as many babies as queens).
- The number of worker bees \( w \) is \( 2b \) (since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees).

Now we can express the total number of bees in terms of \( q \):

1. The number of baby bees: \( b = 2q \)
2. The number of worker bees: \( w = 2b = 2(2q) = 4q \)

Now, we can write the total number of bees in the hive:

\[
q + b + w = 700

Substituting \( b \) and \( w \) in terms of \( q \):

\[
q + 2q + 4q = 700
\]

This simplifies to:

\[

Now, solve for \( q \):

Let me break this down step by step to calculate Kim's weekly profit. Profit is defined as total income minus total expenses.

### Step 1: Determine the total number of clients
- Kim currently has 3 clients.
- He is confident about adding 5 potential clients.
- Total clients = 3 + 5 = 8 clients.

### Step 2: Calculate the expenses per client
- Each client requires:
  - 2 bottles of bleach at $2 each = 2 × $2 = $4
  - 1 pack of cloths at $5 each = $5
- Total expenses per client = $4 (bleach) + $5 (cloths) = $9

### Step 3: Calculate total expenses for all clients
- For 8 clients, total expenses = 8 × $9 = $72

### Step 4: Calculate profit
- Total income per week = $92 (as stated)
- Profit = Total income - Total expenses = $92 - $72 = $20

So, Kim will make a profit of **$20 per week**. If you have any additional details or questions, I'd be happy to help!",0.0052943,11.87333631515503,0,0,cand-grok-3-mini,stage2_vote,

- **Steve's distance**: 
  \[
  3 \text{ miles} = 3 \times 5280 \text{ feet} = 15840 \text{ feet}

2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28:
   \[

We can simplify the second equation:
\[

Subtracting 4 from both sides gives:

Now we have a system of equations:

   - Let \( h \) be the number of hamsters in each cage. The total straw used for hamsters is:
     \[
     \text{Straw for hamsters} = 10 \times h \times 5 = 50h
     \]

2. **Determine the total straw used for rabbits:**
   - The problem states that 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

3. **Determine the total straw used for rats:**
   - The rats are kept in 3 cages, and each rat receives 6 pieces of straw.
   - Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage. The total straw used for rats is:
     \[
     \text{Straw for rats} = 3 \times r \times 6 = 18r
     \]

4. **Set up the equation for total straw:**
   - The total amount of straw distributed among all rodents is given as 160 pieces. Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     50h + 20 + 18r = 160
     \]

5. **Simplify the equation:**
   - Subtract 20 from both sides:
     \[
     50h + 18r = 140
     \]

6. **Express \( h \) in terms of \( r \):**
   - Rearranging gives:
     \[
     50h = 140 - 18r
     \]
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18r}{50}
     \]

7. **Determine integer solutions:**
   - Since \( h \) must be a non-negative integer, \( 140 - 18r \) must be non-negative and divisible by 50.
   - We can check values of \( r \) to find valid integers for \( h \).

   - **If \( r = 0 \):**
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18 \times 0}{50} = \frac{140}{50} = 2.8 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]

   - **If \( r = 1 \):**
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18 \times 1}{50} = \frac{122}{50} = 2.44 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]

   - **If \( r = 2 \):**
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18 \times 2}{50} = \frac{104}{50} = 2.08 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]

   - **If \( r = 3 \):**
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18 \times 3}{50} = \frac{86}{50} = 1.72 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]

   - **If \( r = 4 \):**
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18 \times 4}{50} = \frac{68}{50} = 1.36 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]

   - **If \( r = 5 \):**
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18 \times 5}{50} = \frac{50}{50} = 1 \quad \text{(valid)}
     \]

   - **If \( r = 6 \):**
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18 \times 6}{50} = \frac{32}{50} = 0.64 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]

   - **If \( r = 7 \):**
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18 \times 7}{50} = \frac{14}{50} = 0.28 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]

   - **If \( r = 8 \):**
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18 \times 8}{50} = \frac{-4}{50} \quad \text{(not valid)}
     \]

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The only valid solution is when \( r = 5 \) and \( h = 1 \).
   - Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is \( \boxed{5} \).",0.0037912500000000003,27.158241033554077,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,
gsm8k,gsm8k-187,TrustRoute,1,"To calculate how much Mandy should pay Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can use the formula for compound interest:

\[ A = P(1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n months, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (as a decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of months the money is borrowed.

Given:
- \( P = 100 \) (the amount owed)
- \( r = 0.02 \) (2% interest rate)
- \( n = 3 \) (the number of months)

Now, we can plug in the values:

\[ A = 100(1 + 0.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100(1.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 \times 1.061208 \]

gsm8k,gsm8k-188,TrustRoute,1,"To find out how many bags the trader sold, we can set up the problem step by step.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of bags the trader bought and sold.

2. **Calculate Costs**:
   - The cost of buying the bags: \( 20x \) (since each bag costs $20).
   - The cost of transporting the bags: \( 2x \) (since it costs $2 to transport each bag).
   - Total cost: 
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = 20x + 2x = 22x
     \]

3. **Calculate Revenue**:
   - The selling price of each bag is $30, so the total revenue from selling \( x \) bags is:
     \[
     \text{Total Revenue} = 30x
     \]

4. **Calculate Profit**:
   - Profit is defined as total revenue minus total cost:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost}
     \]
   - Substituting the expressions we found:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = 30x - 22x = 8x
     \]

5. **Set Up the Profit Equation**:
   - We know the total profit is $400:
     \[
     8x = 400
     \]

6. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - Divide both sides by 8:
     \[
     x = \frac{400}{8} = 50
