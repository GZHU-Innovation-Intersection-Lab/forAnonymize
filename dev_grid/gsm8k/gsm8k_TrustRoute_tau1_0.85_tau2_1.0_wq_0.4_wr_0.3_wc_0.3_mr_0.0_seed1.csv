gsm8k,gsm8k-2,TrustRoute,1,"To determine Josh's profit from flipping the house, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total investment**:
   - Purchase price of the house: $80,000
   - Repair costs: $50,000
   - Total investment = Purchase price + Repair costs
   \[
   \text{Total investment} = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the increased value of the house**:
   - The value of the house increased by 150%. 
   - To find the new value, we first calculate 150% of the original purchase price.
   \[
   \text{Increase in value} = 150\% \times 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000
   \]
   - Now, add this increase to the original purchase price to find the new value of the house.
   \[
   \text{New value of the house} = 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the profit**:
   - Profit is calculated as the new value of the house minus the total investment.
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{New value of the house} - \text{Total investment}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000

### Step 1: Understand the problem
- Kyle bought the book for $19.50 after a 25% discount.
- A 25% discount means he paid 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

### Step 2: Set up the equation
- Let the original price be \( P \).
- 75% of \( P \) equals $19.50.
- In mathematical terms: \( 0.75 \times P = 19.50 \).

### Step 3: Solve for \( P \)
- Divide both sides by 0.75:  
  \( P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \).
- Performing the calculation:  
  \( 19.50 \div 0.75 = 26 \).

### Step 4: Verify the result
- If the original price was $26, a 25% discount would be \( 0.25 \times 26 = 6.50 \).

Combining the terms, we have:

### Step 1: Identify the guesses
- The first friend guesses: 80 jelly beans.
- The second friend guesses: 20 more than half of the first friend's guess.
  - Half of 80 is \( 80 \div 2 = 40 \).
  - Adding 20 to that: \( 40 + 20 = 60 \).
  - So, the second guess is 60.
- The third friend guesses: 25% more than the first friend's guess.
  - 25% of 80 is \( 0.25 \times 80 = 20 \).
  - Adding that to the original guess: \( 80 + 20 = 100 \).
  - So, the third guess is 100.

The three guesses are: 80, 60, and 100.

### Step 2: Calculate the average
To find the average, add the guesses together and divide by the number of guesses (which is 3).

- Sum of the guesses: \( 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \).
- Average: \( 240 \div 3 = 80 \).

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Calculate the weight removed from comic books:**
   - Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound.
   - He is removing 30 comic books.
   - Total weight from comic books = 30 × (1/4) = 30/4 = 7.5 pounds.

2. **Determine the remaining weight to remove:**
   - Total weight to remove = 15 pounds.
   - Weight already removed from comic books = 7.5 pounds.
   - Remaining weight = 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

3. **Calculate the number of toys needed to remove the remaining weight:**
   - Each toy weighs 1/2 pound.
   - Let X be the number of toys to remove.
   - The weight from toys should equal the remaining weight: X × (1/2) = 7.5.
   - Solve for X: X = 7.5 ÷ (1/2) = 7.5 × 2 = 15.

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

### Verification:
- Weight from comic books: 7.5 pounds.
- Weight from toys: 15 × (1/2) = 7.5 pounds.
- Total weight removed: 7.5 + 7.5 = 15 pounds.

### Step 1: Understand the components
- **Base cost of groceries**: $40.00 (this is the initial final bill).
- **25% fee**: This is applied to the base cost ($40.00).
- **Delivery fees**: $3.00.
- **Tip**: $4.00.

### Step 2: Calculate the 25% fee
- 25% of $40.00 = 0.25 × 40 = $10.00.

### Step 3: Add up all the costs
- Base cost: $40.00
- Plus 25% fee: +$10.00
- Plus delivery fees: +$3.00
- Plus tip: +$4.00

Total amount = $40.00 + $10.00 + $3.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.

gsm8k,gsm8k-62,TrustRoute,1,"To determine Marcy's annual pension after quitting at 30 years, let's break this down step by step based on the information provided.

### Step 1: Understand the pension structure
- The full annual pension is $50,000 per year if Marcy works for 40 years.
- She starts earning towards this pension after 20 years of service.
- For each year after 20 years, she earns 5% of the full pension value ($50,000) per year.
- 5% of $50,000 is calculated as:  
  \[
  0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500
  \]
  So, for each year beyond 20 years, she earns $2,500 toward her annual pension.

### Step 2: Calculate the years of accrual
- Marcy has worked for 30 years in total.
- The pension accrual begins after 20 years, so the number of years she has accrued pension is:  
  \[
  30 - 20 = 10 \text{ years}
  \]

### Step 3: Compute the annual pension
- For each of those 10 years, she earns $2,500.
- Therefore, her total annual pension is:  
  \[
  10 \times 2,500 = 25,000
  \]
- This means her annual pension after 30 years is $25,000.

Let me set up the problem:

- They won W games
- They won 8 more than they lost, so: W = L + 8

Since all games were either won or lost (assuming no ties):

Now I can substitute W = L + 8 into this equation:

Let me break this down step by step:

**Initial Information:**
- Starting monthly salary: $600
- Salary increase: 10% of initial salary per year
- Increase applies to employees who have stayed 5+ years
- Sylvie just completed 5 years in December

**Step 1: Determine when increases apply**
Sylvie gets her first increase after completing 5 years. Then she'll get increases after years 6, 7, and 8.

**Step 2: Calculate the increase amount**
- Initial monthly salary: $600
- 10% of initial salary: 0.10 × $600 = $60 per month

**Step 3: Calculate salary after 3 more years (at 8 years total)**
- After 5 years: $600/month (first increase applied)
- After 6 years: $600 + $60 = $660/month (second increase)
- After 7 years: $660 + $60 = $720/month (third increase)
- After 8 years: $720 + $60 = $780/month (fourth increase)

Or more directly: $600 + (4 × $60) = $600 + $240 = $780/month

**Step 4: Calculate annual salary**

gsm8k,gsm8k-114,TrustRoute,1,"Let me break this down step by step to solve the problem.

### Step 1: Understand the relationships
- Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
- Jamal's phone can hold 6 times as many photographs as Brittany's phone. So, if Brittany's phone can hold \( B \) photographs, then:
  \[
  1800 = 6 \times B
  \]
- Brittany's phone can hold 50 times as many photographs as the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. Let \( D \) be the number of ducks. Then:
  \[
  B = 50 \times D
  \]

### Step 2: Solve for Brittany's phone capacity
From the equation for Jamal's phone:
\[
B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300
\]
So, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.

### Step 3: Solve for the number of ducks
Now, substitute into the equation for Brittany's phone:
\[
300 = 50 \times D
\]
\[
D = \frac{300}{50} = 6
\]

### Step 4: Final Answer

gsm8k,gsm8k-115,TrustRoute,1,"To calculate Sasha's profit from selling her leftover lumber, we need to determine both her total costs and the total revenue from selling the lumber at the new prices.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the lumber:**
   - For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
     - Cost per board = $10
     - Number of boards = 10
     - Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100

   - For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
     - Cost per board = $16
     - Number of boards = 5
     - Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80

   - Total cost of all lumber = Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards + Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards
   - Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180

2. **Calculate the selling price after the price increase:**
   - The prices have gone up by 50%. Therefore, the new selling prices are:
     - For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
       - New price = Original price + (50% of Original price)
       - New price = $10 + (0.50 * $10) = $10 + $5 = $15

     - For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
       - New price = Original price + (50% of Original price)
       - New price = $16 + (0.50 * $16) = $16 + $8 = $24

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber:**
   - For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
     - Selling price per board = $15
     - Total revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $15/board = $150

   - For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
     - Selling price per board = $24
     - Total revenue from 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $24/board = $120

   - Total revenue = Total revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 boards + Total revenue from 4 x 4 x 10 boards
   - Total revenue = $150 + $120 = $270

4. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   - Profit = $270 - $180 = $90

gsm8k,gsm8k-119,TrustRoute,1,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate Adrien's and Lylah's salaries four years ago and then their new salaries four years later.

**Step 1: Calculate Lylah's salary four years ago.**
*   Adrien's salary four years ago ($A_{old}$) = $40,000
*   Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's salary ($L_{old}$).
    This can be written as: $A_{old} = L_{old} \times (1 + 0.30)$
    $40,000 = L_{old} \times 1.30$
*   Now, solve for $L_{old}$:
    $L_{old} = \frac{40,000}{1.30}$
    $L_{old} \approx \$30,769.23$ (We'll keep this as a fraction for precision in later steps: $\frac{400,000}{13}$)

**Step 2: Calculate Adrien's current salary (four years later).**
*   Adrien's salary increased by 40% from four years ago.
    Adrien's new salary ($A_{new}$) = $A_{old} \times (1 + 0.40)$
    $A_{new} = \$40,000 \times 1.40$
    $A_{new} = \$56,000$

**Step 3: Calculate Lylah's current salary (four years later).**
*   The problem states ""Adrien's and Lylah's salary increased simultaneously."" Since only Adrien's percentage increase (40%) is given, the most reasonable interpretation is that Lylah's salary also increased by the same percentage.
*   Lylah's new salary ($L_{new}$) = $L_{old} \times (1 + 0.40)$
    $L_{new} = \frac{40,000}{1.30} \times 1.40$
    $L_{new} = \frac{56,000}{1.30}$
    $L_{new} \approx \$43,076.92$

**Step 4: Calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later.**
*   Total salary = $A_{new} + L_{new}$
    Total salary = $56,000 + \frac{56,000}{1.30}$
    To add these, we can find a common denominator:
    Total salary = $\frac{56,000 \times 1.30}{1.30} + \frac{56,000}{1.30}$
    Total salary = $\frac{72,800 + 56,000}{1.30}$
    Total salary = $\frac{128,800}{1.30}$
    Total salary = $\frac{1,288,000}{13}$

- 2 subs at $7.50 each: 2 × $7.50 = $15.00
- 2 bags of chips at $1.50 each: 2 × $1.50 = $3.00
- 2 cookies at $1.00 each: 2 × $1.00 = $2.00

**Step 2: Calculate the subtotal (before delivery fee)**
Subtotal = $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

**Step 3: Calculate the 20% delivery fee**
Delivery fee = 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 × $20.00 = $4.00

Let me define variables:
- Let q = number of queen bees
- Let b = number of baby bees
- Let w = number of worker bees

Now I'll set up equations based on the given information:

**Given relationships:**
1. Total bees: q + b + w = 700
2. ""Twice as many worker bees as baby bees"": w = 2b
3. ""Twice as many babies as queens"": b = 2q

**Solving:**

From equation 3: b = 2q

Substituting into equation 2: w = 2b = 2(2q) = 4q

Now substituting both into equation 1:
q + b + w = 700
q + 2q + 4q = 700
7q = 700
q = 100

Therefore:
- Queens: q = 100
- Babies: b = 2q = 2(100) = 200
- Workers: w = 4q = 4(100) = 400

**Verification:**

### Step 1: Understand the key information
- Total clients: Kim has 3 current clients and is including 5 potential ones, so total clients = 3 + 5 = 8.
- Expenses per client:
  - Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach at $2 per bottle.
  - Each client requires 1 pack of cloths at $5 per pack.
- Total income per week: $92.
- Profit formula: Profit = Total Income - Total Expenses.

### Step 2: Calculate total expenses
- Cost for bleach per client: 2 bottles × $2/bottle = $4.
- Cost for cloths per client: 1 pack × $5/pack = $5.
- Total cost per client: $4 + $5 = $9.
- Total expenses for 8 clients: 8 clients × $9/client = $72.

(Alternatively, we can calculate it separately for verification:
- Total bleach needed: 8 clients × 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles.
- Total cost for bleach: 16 bottles × $2/bottle = $32.
- Total cloths needed: 8 clients × 1 pack/client = 8 packs.
- Total cost for cloths: 8 packs × $5/pack = $40.
- Total expenses: $32 + $40 = $72.)

### Step 3: Calculate profit

2. **Next 6 hours:**

   - So, the number of bees returning = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \) bees return.

3. **Next 6 hours:**
   - More bees leave: Two times the number of bees that first left the hive leave again.
   - So, the number of bees leaving = \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees leave.

4. **Final 6 hours:**
   - All the bees that had left before and had not yet returned come back to the hive.
   - The total number of bees that left before this period (which includes the first leaving and the additional leaving) is:
     - First leaving: 30 bees
     - Additional leaving: 60 bees
     - Total bees that left = \( 30 + 60 = 90 \).
   - The number of bees that had returned before this period (after the first 6 hours) is 15.

### Step 1: Convert distances from miles to feet
1 mile = 5280 feet

- **Steve's distance**: 
  \[
  3 \text{ miles} = 3 \times 5280 \text{ feet} = 15840 \text{ feet}
  \]

- **Tim's distance**: 
  \[
  2 \text{ miles} = 2 \times 5280 \text{ feet} = 10560 \text{ feet}

### Step 2: Calculate the time taken for each to get home
Time is calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

- **Steve's time**:
  \[
  \text{Time}_{\text{Steve}} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/min}} = 36 \text{ minutes}

1. **Cost of the computer**: €1090
2. **Cost of the scanner**: €157
3. **Cost of the CD burner**: €74
4. **Cost of the printer**: €102

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of computer} + \text{Cost of scanner} + \text{Cost of CD burner} + \text{Cost of printer}

Now, we calculate the total time for Team B:
- Total time for Team B = 60 seconds + 57 seconds + 54 seconds + 51 seconds
- Total time for Team B = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

Now we find the difference in total time between the two teams:

gsm8k,gsm8k-186,TrustRoute,1,"To find out how many rats are in each cage, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the total straw distributed**: We know that a total of 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the rodents.

2. **Calculate the straw used for hamsters**: There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster receives 5 pieces of straw. Let \( h \) be the number of hamsters in each cage. The total straw used for hamsters is:
   \[
   \text{Straw for hamsters} = 10 \times h \times 5 = 50h
   \]

3. **Calculate the straw used for rabbits**: We know that 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

4. **Calculate the straw used for rats**: Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage. There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat receives 6 pieces of straw. The total straw used for rats is:
   \[
   \text{Straw for rats} = 3 \times r \times 6 = 18r
   \]

5. **Set up the equation**: The total straw distributed is the sum of the straw used for hamsters, rabbits, and rats:
   \[
   50h + 20 + 18r = 160
   \]

6. **Simplify the equation**: Subtract 20 from both sides:
   \[
   50h + 18r = 140
   \]

7. **Express \( h \) in terms of \( r \)**: To find integer solutions, we can try different values for \( h \) and solve for \( r \).

   - If \( h = 2 \):
     \[
     50(2) + 18r = 140 \implies 100 + 18r = 140 \implies 18r = 40 \implies r = \frac{40}{18} \text{ (not an integer)}
     \]

   - If \( h = 3 \):
     \[
     50(3) + 18r = 140 \implies 150 + 18r = 140 \implies 18r = -10 \text{ (not possible)}
     \]

   - If \( h = 1 \):
     \[
     50(1) + 18r = 140 \implies 50 + 18r = 140 \implies 18r = 90 \implies r = 5
     \]

   - If \( h = 0 \):
     \[
     50(0) + 18r = 140 \implies 18r = 140 \implies r = \frac{140}{18} \text{ (not an integer)}
     \]

8. **Conclusion**: The only integer solution we found is when \( h = 1 \) and \( r = 5 \).

Thus, the number of rats in each cage is \( \boxed{5} \).",0.00263895,23.142362594604492,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,
gsm8k,gsm8k-187,TrustRoute,1,"To calculate how much Mandy should pay Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can use the formula for compound interest:

\[ A = P(1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n months, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (as a decimal).
