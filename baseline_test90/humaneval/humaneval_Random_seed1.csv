humaneval,HumanEval/84,Random,1,"It looks like there's a misunderstanding in the problem description. Based on the examples provided:

- For N = 1000, the sum of its decimal digits is 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1, and the output is the binary representation of 1, which is ""1"".
- For N = 150, the sum of its decimal digits is 1 + 5 + 0 = 6, and the output is the binary representation of 6, which is ""110"".
- For N = 147, the sum of its decimal digits is 1 + 4 + 7 = 12, and the output is the binary representation of 12, which is ""1100"".

The function should:
1. Compute the sum of the digits of N in decimal.
2. Convert that sum to its binary representation as a string.

I'll implement this in Python as per the instructions.

Here's the corrected and executable code:

```python
def solve(N):
    # Step 1: Calculate the sum of the digits of N
    sum_of_digits = 0
    temp = N
    while temp > 0:
        sum_of_digits += temp % 10  # Add the last digit
        temp = temp // 10  # Remove the last digit
    
    # Step 2: Convert the sum to binary and return as a string
    # bin() function returns a string like '0b101', so we slice to remove '0b'
    if sum_of_digits == 0:
        return '0'  # Special case for sum of 0
    return bin(sum_of_digits)[2:]  # [2:] removes the '0b' prefix
```

### Explanation:
- **Input Handling**: The function takes an integer N (0 ≤ N ≤ 10000).
- **Sum Calculation**: We loop through the digits of N by repeatedly taking the modulus 10 and integer division by 10.
- **Binary Conversion**: We use Python's `bin()` function to convert the sum to binary, then remove the '0b' prefix.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - If N = 0, the sum is 0, and the output is ""0"".
  - For larger N, like 10000, the sum is 1, and the output is ""1"".

### Examples:
- `solve(1000)`: Sum = 1, Binary = ""1"" → Output: ""1""
- `solve(150)`: Sum = 6, Binary = ""110"" → Output: ""110""
- `solve(147)`: Sum = 12, Binary = ""1100"" → Output: ""1100""

            number -= value   # Subtract the value from the number
    
    return result.lower()  # Return the result in lowercase
```

### Explanation:
- **Input Validation**: The function first checks if the input `number` is between 1 and 1000. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.
- **Roman Numeral Mapping**: A list of tuples is used, where each tuple contains an integer value and its corresponding Roman symbol (in uppercase).
- **Conversion Logic**: The function iterates through the list. For each value, it appends the corresponding symbol to the result string as many times as possible without exceeding the remaining value of the number.
- **Lowercase Output**: The final string is converted to lowercase using the `.lower()` method.
- **Edge Cases**: This handles all numbers from 1 to 1000 correctly, as per the restrictions.

You can test this function directly in a Python environment. For example:
```python

humaneval,HumanEval/119,Random,1,"Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Check if concatenating the two strings in either order results in balanced parentheses
2. A balanced string has matching open and close parentheses in the correct order

Let me think through the approach:
- There are only 2 possible concatenations: `lst[0] + lst[1]` or `lst[1] + lst[0]`
- For each concatenation, I need to check if parentheses are balanced
- To check balance: count should never go negative (no closing before opening), and final count should be 0

Here's my solution:

```python
def match_parens(lst):
    '''
    You are given a list of two strings, both strings consist of open
    parentheses '(' or close parentheses ')' only.
    Your job is to check if it is possible to concatenate the two strings in
    some order, that the resulting string will be good.
    A string S is considered to be good if and only if all parentheses in S
    are balanced. For example: the string '(())()' is good, while the string
    '())' is not.
    Return 'Yes' if there's a way to make a good string, and return 'No' otherwise.

    Examples:
    match_parens(['()(', ')']) == 'Yes'
    match_parens([')', ')']) == 'No'
    '''
    
    def is_balanced(s):
        """"""Check if a string of parentheses is balanced""""""
        count = 0
        for char in s:
            if char == '(':
                count += 1
            else:  # char == ')'
                count -= 1
            # If count goes negative, we have more closing than opening at some point
            if count < 0:
                return False
        # At the end, count should be 0 for balanced parentheses
        return count == 0
    
    # Try both possible concatenations
    if is_balanced(lst[0] + lst[1]) or is_balanced(lst[1] + lst[0]):
        return 'Yes'
    else:
        return 'No'
```

**How it works:**

1. `is_balanced(s)`: Helper function that checks if a string has balanced parentheses
   - Maintains a counter: +1 for '(', -1 for ')'
   - If counter goes negative, we have a ')' without matching '(' → not balanced
   - If counter ends at 0, all parentheses are matched → balanced

2. Main function tries both concatenation orders:
   - `lst[0] + lst[1]`
   - `lst[1] + lst[0]`
   
3. Returns 'Yes' if either order produces a balanced string, 'No' otherwise

**Test cases:**
- `match_parens(['()(', ')'])`: `'()()' ` is balanced → 'Yes'
- `match_parens([')', ')'])`: `'))' ` is never balanced → 'No'",0.0115799999999999,23.071058988571167,0,0,claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,,

        else:  # Odd index
            result.append(l[i])  # Keep the original element
    
    return result
```

### Explanation:
- **Line 1-2**: Check if the input list is empty and return an empty list if so.
- **Line 5**: Use a list comprehension to collect elements from even indices (i.e., indices where `i % 2 == 0`).
- **Line 8**: Sort the collected even-indexed elements using Python's `sorted()` function, which sorts in ascending order by default.
- **Line 11-19**: Iterate through the original list:
  - For even indices, append the next element from the sorted even list.
  - For odd indices, append the original element from the input list.
- **Line 20**: Return the resulting list.

### Example Usage:
You can test the function in a Python environment like this:

### Explanation:
- **Line 1-2**: Imports are already provided, and I've added `import math` for completeness, though it's not used in this function.
- **Error Handling**: I added a check for an empty list to make the function robust, as dividing by zero would cause an error.
- **Mean Calculation**: `sum(numbers) / n` computes the arithmetic mean.
- **Absolute Deviations**: A list comprehension generates the absolute differences between each element and the mean.

### Explanation:
- **Import**: `hashlib` is imported at the top to handle MD5 hashing.
- **Edge Case Handling**: If `text` is an empty string (i.e., `""""`), the function immediately returns `None`.
- **MD5 Computation**: For non-empty strings, the string is encoded to bytes using UTF-8 (default for `.encode()`), and the MD5 hash is computed. The result is returned as a lowercase hexadecimal string.
- **Testing**: You can verify it with the provided example:

```

### Explanation:
- **Line 1-2**: Check if `n > m`. If true, immediately return `-1`.
- **Line 5**: Compute the average as `(n + m) / 2.0`. This is derived from the formula for the average of an arithmetic series from `n` to `m`.
- **Line 8**: Use `round()` to round the average to the nearest integer. Python's `round()` function handles halfway cases (e.g., 26.5 rounds to 26).
- **Line 11**: Convert the rounded integer to a binary string using `bin()`, which automatically prefixes the result with ""0b"".
- **Return**: The function returns the binary string as a string.

### Explanation:
- **Absolute value**: We use `abs(num)` to ignore the negative sign, as it doesn't count as a digit.
- **String conversion**: Converting the number to a string makes it easy to iterate through each digit.
- **Loop and checks**: For each digit, we convert it back to an integer and check if it's even (using `digit % 2 == 0`).
- **Edge cases handled**:
  - If `num` is 0, it returns `(1, 0)` since 0 is even.
  - Single-digit numbers work as expected.
  - Negative numbers are processed correctly by taking the absolute value.

You can test this function directly in a Python environment. For example:

humaneval,HumanEval/26,Random,1,"To solve this problem, we need to identify elements that appear exactly once in the input list while preserving their original order. Elements that appear more than once should be excluded.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1.  **Count Occurrences**: First, iterate through the input list to count how many times each element appears. A hash map (dictionary in Python) is ideal for this, where keys are the numbers and values are their counts. Python's `collections.Counter` provides an efficient way to do this.

2.  **Filter and Build Result**: After counting, iterate through the *original* input list again. For each element, check its count from the previously built count map. If an element's count is exactly `1`, it means it's unique and should be included in the result. Append such elements to a new list.

3.  **Return**: The new list containing only the unique elements (those appearing exactly once) in their original order is the desired result.

**Example Walkthrough:**

Let's use `numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4]`

1.  **Count Occurrences**:
    Using `collections.Counter(numbers)`:
    `counts = {1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 1, 4: 1}`

2.  **Filter and Build Result**:
    Initialize `result = []`.
    Iterate through `numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4]`:
    *   `num = 1`: `counts[1]` is `1`. Append `1` to `result`. `result = [1]`
    *   `num = 2`: `counts[2]` is `2`. This is not `1`, so skip.
    *   `num = 3`: `counts[3]` is `1`. Append `3` to `result`. `result = [1, 3]`
    *   `num = 2`: `counts[2]` is `2`. This is not `1`, so skip.
    *   `num = 4`: `counts[4]` is `1`. Append `4` to `result`. `result = [1, 3, 4]`

3.  **Return**: `[1, 3, 4]`

This matches the example output.

humaneval,HumanEval/133,Random,1,"To solve this problem, we need to compute the sum of the squares of each element in a list after rounding each element up to the nearest integer (ceiling). The solution involves processing each number in the list, applying the ceiling operation, squaring the result, and summing all the squared values.

### Approach
1. **Ceiling Operation**: For each number in the list, round it up to the nearest integer. This is done using the `math.ceil` function, which handles both positive and negative numbers correctly (e.g., `ceil(1.4)` is 2, `ceil(-2.4)` is -2).
2. **Squaring**: Square each of the ceiling values obtained from the previous step.
3. **Summing**: Sum all the squared values to get the final result.

### Solution Code
```python

   - **Squaring**: The ceiling value is squared.
   - **Summing**: The squared value is added to a running total.

humaneval,HumanEval/93,Random,1,"The problem asks us to implement an `encode` function that transforms a given message string. The encoding process involves two main rules applied to each character:

1.  **Swap Case:** All letters in the message should have their case swapped (lowercase to uppercase, uppercase to lowercase).
2.  **Vowel Replacement:** If a letter becomes a vowel *after* its case has been swapped, it should then be replaced by the letter that appears two places ahead of it in the English alphabet. Non-vowel letters (after case swap) are not further modified. Non-alphabetic characters (like spaces) should remain unchanged.

Let's break down the logic for a single character:

1.  **Check if the character is an alphabet letter:**
    *   If it's not a letter (e.g., a space, punctuation), it should be appended to the result as is.
2.  **If it is a letter:**
    *   First, perform the case swap. Python's `str.swapcase()` method is perfect for this.
    *   Next, determine if this *case-swapped* character is a vowel. We'll consider 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' (and their uppercase counterparts) as vowels. It's easiest to convert the `swapped_char` to lowercase for this check.
    *   **If `swapped_char` is a vowel:** Calculate the character that is two places ahead in the alphabet. We can do this by getting its ASCII value using `ord()`, adding 2, and converting back to a character using `chr()`. Since we are only shifting standard English vowels (A, E, I, O, U) by +2, they will not wrap around past 'Z' or 'z' (e.g., U + 2 = W).
    *   **If `swapped_char` is *not* a vowel:** The `swapped_char` (after case swap but no vowel replacement) is appended to the result.

We will build the encoded message by collecting modified characters in a list and then joining them at the end for efficiency.

**Example Walkthrough (`encode('test')`):**

*   **'t'**:
    *   Is a letter.
    *   `'t'.swapcase()` is `'T'`.
    *   Is `'T'` a vowel? No (`'T'.lower()` is `'t'`, not in `{'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}`).
    *   Result: `'T'`.
*   **'e'**:
    *   Is a letter.
    *   `'e'.swapcase()` is `'E'`.
    *   Is `'E'` a vowel? Yes (`'E'.lower()` is `'e'`, which is in `{'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}`).
    *   Shift 'E' by 2: `ord('E') + 2 = 69 + 2 = 71`. `chr(71)` is `'G'`.
    *   Result: `'G'`.
*   **'s'**:
    *   Is a letter.
    *   `'s'.swapcase()` is `'S'`.
    *   Is `'S'` a vowel? No.
    *   Result: `'S'`.
*   **'t'**:
    *   Is a letter.
    *   `'t'.swapcase()` is `'T'`.
    *   Is `'T'` a vowel? No.
    *   Result: `'T'`.

Combining these gives `'TGST'`, which matches the example.

    else:  # Even number of elements
        return (sorted_l[mid - 1] + sorted_l[mid]) / 2  # Average of the two middle elements

### Explanation:
- **Sorting**: The list is sorted using `sorted(l)` to ensure we can find the middle value(s).
- **Edge Case Handling**: If the list is empty, a `ValueError` is raised.
- **Median Calculation**:
  - For an odd-length list, the middle element is returned.
  - For an even-length list, the average of the two middle elements is calculated, which results in a float (e.g., 15.0).
- **Assumptions**: The list contains numbers (integers or floats). If the list contains non-numeric values, a `TypeError` will occur during sorting, which is standard Python behavior.

1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing `min_sum` to positive infinity to ensure that any sum we calculate will be smaller. `current_sum` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the sum of the current sub-array.

2. **Iteration**: We loop through each number in the input list `nums`:

   - We update `min_sum` to be the minimum of its current value and `current_sum`.
   - If `current_sum` becomes positive, we reset it to 0 because starting a new sub-array from the next element would yield a smaller sum.

humaneval,HumanEval/152,Random,1,"To solve this problem, we need to compare two lists of scores: the actual scores from a game and the guessed scores. The goal is to generate a new list where each element represents how far off each guess was from the actual score. If the guess matches the actual score, the corresponding element in the result list should be 0; otherwise, it should be the absolute difference between the actual score and the guessed score.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires comparing each element in the `guess` list with the corresponding element in the `game` list. For each index, if the values are the same, the result is 0. If they differ, the result is the absolute difference between the two values.
2. **Intuition**: By iterating through both lists simultaneously, we can compute the absolute difference for each pair of elements. This approach efficiently processes each element in linear time.
3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a list comprehension to iterate over pairs of elements from the `game` and `guess` lists. For each pair, we compute the absolute difference between the elements.
4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution processes each element exactly once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the lists. The space complexity is O(n) to store the result list.

### Solution Code
```python

humaneval,HumanEval/41,Random,1,"To solve the problem of counting the number of collisions between two sets of cars moving in opposite directions, we can reason through the scenario step by step.

1. **Understanding the Movement**: We have `n` cars moving from left to right and `n` cars moving from right to left. Since they are infinitely sturdy and continue moving as if they did not collide, every car from the left will eventually ""collide"" with every car from the right.

2. **Counting Collisions**: Each car moving left to right will collide with each car moving right to left. Therefore, if there are `n` cars in each direction, the total number of collisions can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Total Collisions} = n \times n = n^2
   \]

3. **Implementation**: We can implement this logic in the function `car_race_collision`.

Here’s the code that implements this logic:

```python

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: We initialize a `count` variable to keep track of the number of occurrences and a `start` variable to indicate where to start searching in the string.
2. **Loop**: We use a `while True` loop to continuously search for the substring.
3. **Finding Substring**: The `find` method is used to locate the substring starting from the current `start` index. If the substring is not found, `find` returns `-1`, and we break the loop.
4. **Counting Occurrences**: Each time we find the substring, we increment the `count` and move the `start` index one position to the right to check for overlapping occurrences.
5. **Return Count**: Finally, we return the total count of occurrences.

humaneval,HumanEval/25,Random,1,"To factorize an integer `n` into its prime factors, we can follow a systematic approach:

1.  **Handle the factor 2:** Continuously divide `n` by 2 as long as it's divisible, adding 2 to our list of factors each time.
2.  **Handle odd factors:** After removing all factors of 2, `n` must be odd. We then iterate through odd numbers starting from 3 up to the square root of the current `n`. For each odd number `i`, we continuously divide `n` by `i` as long as it's divisible, adding `i` to our list of factors. We increment `i` by 2 to only check odd numbers.
3.  **Handle remaining prime factor:** If, after the loop, `n` is still greater than 1, it means the remaining value of `n` is a prime number itself (and it's the largest prime factor). We add this remaining `n` to our list of factors.

This method ensures that factors are added in ascending order and that each factor appears the correct number of times.

**Edge Cases:**
*   **`n = 1`**: The function should return an empty list `[]` as 1 has no prime factors. The product of an empty set of factors is conventionally 1.

humaneval,HumanEval/109,Random,1,"To determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing right shift operations, we need to check if the array is a ""cyclically sorted"" array. A cyclically sorted array is essentially a sorted array that has been rotated.

**Key Idea:**
A truly sorted array (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`) or an array that can be sorted by a single rotation (e.g., `[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`) will have at most one ""descent"" when traversed cyclically. A descent occurs when `arr[i] > arr[i+1]`.

Let's analyze the number of descents (or ""breaks"" in the non-decreasing order) in a cyclic fashion:
1.  **Empty array**: An empty array is considered sorted, so it has 0 descents.
2.  **Already sorted array (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`)**:
    *   `1 < 2`, `2 < 3`, `3 < 4`, `4 < 5`. No descents here.
    *   However, when we consider the cyclic wrap-around, we compare the last element `arr[N-1]` with the first element `arr[0]`. Here, `5 > 1`. This counts as one descent. So, an already sorted array with `N > 0` elements will have exactly 1 cyclic descent.
3.  **Rotated sorted array (e.g., `[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`)**:
    *   `3 < 4`, `4 < 5`.
    *   `5 > 1` (descent!). This is the actual ""break"" point from the sorted order.
    *   `1 < 2`.
    *   Cyclic wrap-around: `2 < 3`. No descent.
    *   Total: 1 cyclic descent.
4.  **Non-sortable array (e.g., `[3, 5, 4, 1, 2]`)**:
    *   `3 < 5`.
    *   `5 > 4` (descent 1!).
    *   `4 > 1` (descent 2!).
    *   `1 < 2`.
    *   Cyclic wrap-around: `2 < 3`. No descent.
    *   Total: 2 cyclic descents.

**Conclusion:**
An array `arr` with unique elements can be sorted by right shifts if and only if there is at most one pair `(arr[i], arr[(i+1) % N])` such that `arr[i] > arr[(i+1) % N]`.

**Algorithm:**
1.  Get the length of the array, `N`.
2.  **Handle the empty array edge case**: If `N` is 0, return `True`.
3.  Initialize a counter `breaks` to 0.
4.  Iterate through the array from index `i = 0` to `N-1`.
5.  In each iteration, compare `arr[i]` with `arr[(i + 1) % N]`. The modulo operator `(i + 1) % N` correctly handles the wrap-around from the last element to the first.
6.  If `arr[i] > arr[(i + 1) % N]`, increment `breaks`.
7.  After iterating through all elements, if `breaks` is less than or equal to 1, return `True`. Otherwise, return `False`.

**Example `move_one_ball([3, 4, 5, 1, 2])`:**
*   `N = 5`
*   `breaks = 0`
*   `i = 0`: `arr[0]=3`, `arr[1]=4`. `3 < 4`.
*   `i = 1`: `arr[1]=4`, `arr[2]=5`. `4 < 5`.
*   `i = 2`: `arr[2]=5`, `arr[3]=1`. `5 > 1`. `breaks` becomes 1.
*   `i = 3`: `arr[3]=1`, `arr[4]=2`. `1 < 2`.
*   `i = 4`: `arr[4]=2`, `arr[(4+1)%5]=arr[0]=3`. `2 < 3`.
*   Loop ends. `breaks` is 1. Since `1 <= 1`, return `True`.

**Example `move_one_ball([3, 5, 4, 1, 2])`:**
*   `N = 5`
*   `breaks = 0`
*   `i = 0`: `arr[0]=3`, `arr[1]=5`. `3 < 5`.
*   `i = 1`: `arr[1]=5`, `arr[2]=4`. `5 > 4`. `breaks` becomes 1.
*   `i = 2`: `arr[2]=4`, `arr[3]=1`. `4 > 1`. `breaks` becomes 2.
*   `i = 3`: `arr[3]=1`, `arr[4]=2`. `1 < 2`.
*   `i = 4`: `arr[4]=2`, `arr[(4+1)%5]=arr[0]=3`. `2 < 3`.
*   Loop ends. `breaks` is 2. Since `2 <= 1` is false, return `False`.

This approach is efficient, running in O(N) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.

humaneval,HumanEval/56,Random,1,"Here's the implementation of the `correct_bracketing` function in Python. I've added the code inside the function to check if every opening bracket ""<"" has a corresponding closing bracket "">"". This is done by maintaining a balance counter: increment for each ""<"", decrement for each "">"", and ensure the counter never goes negative and ends at zero.

```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    """""" brackets is a string of ""<"" and "">"".
    return True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

    >>> correct_bracketing(""<"")

            balance -= 1  # Decrement for closing bracket

This function works as follows:
- It iterates through each character in the string.
- If the counter goes negative at any point, it means there's an unmatched "">"", so it returns `False`.
- At the end, if the counter is zero, all ""<"" have matching "">"", so it returns `True`.

humaneval,HumanEval/104,Random,1,"To solve this problem, we need to iterate through each number in the input list `x`. For each number, we'll check if any of its digits are even. If a number contains no even digits, we add it to a temporary list. Finally, we sort this temporary list and return it.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1.  **Initialize an empty list:** Create an empty list, say `result_list`, to store the numbers that satisfy the condition (i.e., contain no even digits).

2.  **Iterate through input numbers:** Loop through each `num` in the given input list `x`.

3.  **Check for even digits in each number:**
    *   For each `num`, convert it to a string. This makes it easy to access its individual digits.
    *   Initialize a boolean flag, `has_even_digit`, to `False`. This flag will become `True` if we find any even digit in the current number.
    *   Iterate through each character (digit) in the string representation of `num`.
    *   Convert the character back to an integer.
    *   Check if this integer digit is even (i.e., `digit % 2 == 0`).
    *   If an even digit is found, set `has_even_digit` to `True` and break out of the inner loop (no need to check further digits for this number, as it already fails the condition).

4.  **Add to result if no even digits:** After checking all digits of `num`, if `has_even_digit` is still `False`, it means the number contains only odd digits. In this case, add `num` to our `result_list`.

5.  **Sort and return:** After processing all numbers in the input list `x`, sort the `result_list` in increasing order as required by the problem description. Then, return the sorted `result_list`.

humaneval,HumanEval/14,Random,1,"To solve this problem, we need to generate all prefixes of a given string, ordered from the shortest to the longest. A prefix of a string is any substring that starts from the beginning of the string up to any position in the string. 

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The task requires generating all possible prefixes of the input string. For a string of length `n`, there will be `n` prefixes. For example, the string ""abc"" has prefixes ""a"", ""ab"", and ""abc"".
2. **Intuition**: By iterating from the start of the string to each subsequent character, we can collect substrings starting from the first character up to the current character. This ensures we capture all prefixes in order of increasing length.
3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a simple loop that runs from 1 to the length of the string (inclusive). In each iteration, we take a substring from the start of the string up to the current index. This substring is added to a list which is then returned.
4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in O(n) time, where `n` is the length of the string. Each substring operation takes O(k) time for the k-th prefix, but the total time remains O(n) due to the linear pass through the string.

### Solution Code
```python
from typing import List

def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    return [string[:i] for i in range(1, len(string) + 1)]
```

### Explanation
- **List Comprehension**: The solution uses a list comprehension to generate prefixes efficiently. The loop variable `i` ranges from 1 to the length of the string (inclusive).
- **Substring Extraction**: For each value of `i`, the expression `string[:i]` extracts the substring from the start of the string up to (but not including) the `i`-th character. Since Python slicing is zero-based and the end index is exclusive, `string[:i]` gives the prefix of length `i`.
- **Ordering**: The loop naturally progresses from 1 to the string's length, ensuring prefixes are generated in order from shortest to longest.

humaneval,HumanEval/70,Random,1,"To sort a list in ""strange order"" as described, we need to repeatedly pick the minimum remaining element, then the maximum remaining element, then the minimum, and so on.

Here's a step-by-step approach using a two-pointer technique:

1.  **Handle Edge Cases:** If the input list is empty, return an empty list.
2.  **Sort the List:** Create a sorted copy of the input list. This is crucial because it allows us to easily access the current minimum (at the beginning of the sorted list) and the current maximum (at the end of the sorted list).
3.  **Initialize Pointers and Result List:**
    *   `result`: An empty list to store the elements in the strange order.
    *   `left`: A pointer initialized to `0` (start of the sorted list, representing the minimum).
    *   `right`: A pointer initialized to `len(sorted_lst) - 1` (end of the sorted list, representing the maximum).
    *   `take_min_turn`: A boolean flag, initialized to `True`, to alternate between picking the minimum and maximum.
4.  **Iterate and Append:** Loop as long as `left <= right`:
    *   If `take_min_turn` is `True`, append `sorted_lst[left]` to `result` and increment `left`.
    *   If `take_min_turn` is `False`, append `sorted_lst[right]` to `result` and decrement `right`.
    *   Toggle `take_min_turn` for the next iteration.
5.  **Return Result:** Once the loop finishes (when `left` crosses `right`), return the `result` list.

**Example Walkthrough: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`**

1.  `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
2.  `sorted_lst = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
3.  `result = []`, `left = 0`, `right = 3`, `take_min_turn = True`

*   **Iteration 1:** (`left=0, right=3`, `take_min_turn=True`)
    *   Append `sorted_lst[0]` (which is `1`) to `result`. `result = [1]`
    *   `left` becomes `1`.
    *   `take_min_turn` becomes `False`.
*   **Iteration 2:** (`left=1, right=3`, `take_min_turn=False`)
    *   Append `sorted_lst[3]` (which is `4`) to `result`. `result = [1, 4]`
    *   `right` becomes `2`.
    *   `take_min_turn` becomes `True`.
*   **Iteration 3:** (`left=1, right=2`, `take_min_turn=True`)
    *   Append `sorted_lst[1]` (which is `2`) to `result`. `result = [1, 4, 2]`
    *   `left` becomes `2`.
    *   `take_min_turn` becomes `False`.
*   **Iteration 4:** (`left=2, right=2`, `take_min_turn=False`)
    *   Append `sorted_lst[2]` (which is `3`) to `result`. `result = [1, 4, 2, 3]`
    *   `right` becomes `1`.
    *   `take_min_turn` becomes `True`.
*   **End:** `left` (2) is no longer `<= right` (1). The loop terminates.
*   Return `[1, 4, 2, 3]`.

This approach correctly handles lists of even and odd lengths, as well as lists with duplicate elements.

### Explanation:
- **is_prime function**: This is a helper function that efficiently checks if a number is prime. It handles edge cases (e.g., numbers ≤ 1 are not prime) and uses an optimized loop to check divisibility up to the square root of the number.
- **prime_fib function**: 
  - It first checks if `n` is a positive integer.
  - It generates Fibonacci numbers using a loop (`a` and `b` are the first two numbers in the sequence).
  - For each Fibonacci number (`b`), it checks if it's greater than 1 and prime.
  - It increments a counter for each prime Fibonacci number found and returns the number when the counter reaches `n`.
- **Time Complexity**: Fibonacci generation is O(1) per step, and prime checking is O(√k) for a number k. The function will run until it finds the n-th prime Fibonacci, which grows quickly, so it's efficient for small to moderate n.

You can test this code in a Python environment. For example:
```python
print(prime_fib(1))  # Output: 2
print(prime_fib(2))  # Output: 3
print(prime_fib(5))  # Output: 89

humaneval,HumanEval/160,Random,1,"To solve this problem, we need to construct an algebraic expression string by interleaving the operands and operators, and then evaluate this string. Python's built-in `eval()` function is perfectly suited for this task, as it can parse and execute a string as a Python expression, respecting standard operator precedence.

Here's a step-by-step approach:
1.  **Initialize the expression string**: Start by converting the first operand (`operand[0]`) to a string and assigning it to a variable, say `expression_str`.
2.  **Iterate and append**: Loop through the `operator` list. For each operator at index `i`, append the operator itself to `expression_str`, and then append the corresponding next operand (`operand[i+1]`) (also converted to a string) to `expression_str`.
3.  **Evaluate**: After the loop completes, `expression_str` will contain the full algebraic expression. Use `eval(expression_str)` to calculate its value.

Let's walk through the example:
`operator = ['+', '*', '-']`
`operand = [2, 3, 4, 5]`

1.  `expression_str` starts as `str(operand[0])`, which is `""2""`.
2.  **Loop 1 (i=0)**:
    *   `operator[0]` is `'+'`. `expression_str` becomes `""2+""`.
    *   `operand[1]` is `3`. `expression_str` becomes `""2+3""`.
3.  **Loop 2 (i=1)**:
    *   `operator[1]` is `'*'`. `expression_str` becomes `""2+3*""`.
    *   `operand[2]` is `4`. `expression_str` becomes `""2+3*4""`.
4.  **Loop 3 (i=2)**:
    *   `operator[2]` is `'-'`. `expression_str` becomes `""2+3*4-""`.
    *   `operand[3]` is `5`. `expression_str` becomes `""2+3*4-5""`.
5.  After the loop, `expression_str` is `""2+3*4-5""`.
6.  `eval(""2+3*4-5"")` calculates `2 + (3 * 4) - 5 = 2 + 12 - 5 = 14 - 5 = 9`.

### Explanation:
1. **Base Cases**: We handle the first four cases directly since they are defined explicitly.
2. **Iterative Calculation**: For `n >= 4`, we use a loop to calculate each subsequent value based on the previous four values.
3. **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(n) due to the list storing the sequence values, but we could optimize it to O(1) if we only keep track of the last four values.
4. **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is O(n) since we compute each value once in a single loop.

humaneval,HumanEval/96,Random,1,"To implement the `count_up_to` function that returns an array of the first prime numbers less than a given non-negative integer `n`, we can follow these steps:

1. Create a helper function to check if a number is prime.
2. Iterate through numbers starting from 2 up to `n-1`.
3. Collect the prime numbers in a list and return that list.

Here’s the implementation:

```python

    if num <= 1:
        return False

print(count_up_to(18))  # => [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]
```

### Explanation:
- The `is_prime` function checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number.
- The `count_up_to` function initializes an empty list `primes`, iterates through all integers from 2 to `n-1`, checks if each integer is prime, and appends it to the list if it is.

1. The number must be greater than 10.
2. Both its first and last digits must be odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the implementation:

1.  **Initialize a counter**: We'll need a variable, say `count`, to keep track of numbers that meet the criteria. Initialize it to 0.
2.  **Iterate through the numbers**: Loop through each `num` in the input list `nums`.
3.  **Check the first condition**: Inside the loop, first check if `num > 10`. If this condition is not met, the number cannot be counted, so we move to the next number in the list.
4.  **Extract the last digit**: If `num > 10`, we extract its last digit. This can be done using the modulo operator: `last_digit = num % 10`.
5.  **Extract the first digit**: To get the first digit of a number, the easiest way is to convert the number to a string and then take the first character.
    *   Convert `num` to a string: `s_num = str(num)`.
    *   Get the first character and convert it back to an integer: `first_digit = int(s_num[0])`.
6.  **Check if digits are odd**: Now, we check if both `first_digit` and `last_digit` are odd. A digit is odd if its remainder when divided by 2 is not 0 (i.e., `digit % 2 != 0`).
7.  **Increment counter**: If both the first and last digits are odd, increment our `count` variable.
8.  **Return the count**: After iterating through all numbers in the list, return the final `count`.

Let me think through the logic:

1. For `lst1` to contain only even numbers, I need exactly `len(lst1)` even numbers total
2. I can exchange any elements between the lists, so what matters is the **total count of even numbers** across both lists
3. If the total number of even numbers in both lists combined is at least `len(lst1)`, then I can move enough even numbers into `lst1`

  - Single element: Works correctly (e.g., `[5]` returns `(5, 5)`).
  - Lists with zeros or negatives: The code handles them as expected (e.g., `[0, 0]` returns `(0, 0)`, and `[-1, 2]` returns `(1, -2)`).

humaneval,HumanEval/107,Random,1,"The problem asks us to count the number of even and odd integer palindromes within a given range `[1, n]`.

Here's a step-by-step approach to solve this:

1.  **Initialize Counters**: We need two variables to keep track of the counts: `even_palindromes = 0` and `odd_palindromes = 0`.
2.  **Iterate through Numbers**: Loop through each integer `i` from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
3.  **Check for Palindrome**: For each number `i`, determine if it is a palindrome.
    *   The easiest way to do this is to convert the integer to a string.
    *   Then, compare the string with its reverse. If they are the same, the number is a palindrome.
    *   For example, `str(121)` is ""121"". The reverse of ""121"" is also ""121"". So, 121 is a palindrome.
    *   For example, `str(12)` is ""12"". The reverse of ""12"" is ""21"". They are not the same, so 12 is not a palindrome.
4.  **Check for Even/Odd**: If the number `i` is indeed a palindrome, check if it's even or odd.
    *   An integer is even if it is perfectly divisible by 2 (i.e., `i % 2 == 0`).
    *   Otherwise, it is odd.
5.  **Increment Counters**:
    *   If the palindrome is even, increment `even_palindromes`.
    *   If the palindrome is odd, increment `odd_palindromes`.
6.  **Return Result**: After checking all numbers from 1 to `n`, return the counts as a tuple `(even_palindromes, odd_palindromes)`.

**Example Walkthrough (n=3):**

1.  `even_palindromes = 0`, `odd_palindromes = 0`
2.  **i = 1**:
    *   `str(1)` is ""1"". Reverse is ""1"". It's a palindrome.
    *   `1 % 2 != 0`, so it's odd.
    *   `odd_palindromes = 1`.
3.  **i = 2**:
    *   `str(2)` is ""2"". Reverse is ""2"". It's a palindrome.
    *   `2 % 2 == 0`, so it's even.
    *   `even_palindromes = 1`.
4.  **i = 3**:
    *   `str(3)` is ""3"". Reverse is ""3"". It's a palindrome.
    *   `3 % 2 != 0`, so it's odd.
    *   `odd_palindromes = 2`.
5.  Loop ends.
6.  Return `(even_palindromes, odd_palindromes)` which is `(1, 2)`.

This approach is efficient enough given the constraint `1 <= n <= 10^3`, as it involves a simple loop and string conversions for each number.

humaneval,HumanEval/76,Random,1,"To determine if a number `x` is a ""simple power"" of `n`, we need to check if `x` can be expressed as `n` raised to some non-negative integer power `k`, i.e., `x = n**k` where `k >= 0`.

Let's break down the logic and consider edge cases:

1.  **Invalid Inputs (`x < 1` or `n < 1`):**
    *   If `x` is less than 1 (i.e., `0` or negative), it cannot be a power of a positive integer `n` raised to a non-negative integer `k`. For `n >= 1` and `k >= 0`, `n**k` will always be `1` or greater. So, `x < 1` should return `False`.
    *   If `n` is less than 1 (i.e., `0` or negative): The problem's examples consistently use positive `n`. If `n=0`, `0**k` is either `0` (for `k>0`) or `1` (for `k=0`). If `n` is negative, `(-n)**k` alternates signs. Given the context and examples, `n` is usually assumed to be a positive integer base. We'll return `False` for `n < 1`.

2.  **Special Case: `n = 1`:**
    *   If `n` is `1`, then `1` raised to any integer power (`1**k`) is always `1`.
    *   Therefore, `x` can only be a power of `1` if `x` itself is `1`.
    *   So, if `n == 1`, return `x == 1`.
        *   `is_simple_power(1, 1)` should be `True` (`1**0 = 1`).
        *   `is_simple_power(3, 1)` should be `False`.

3.  **Special Case: `x = 1` (for `n > 1`):**
    *   Any positive integer `n` (greater than 1) raised to the power of `0` is `1` (`n**0 = 1`).
    *   So, if `x == 1` and `n > 1`, it is a simple power. Return `True`.
        *   `is_simple_power(1, 4)` should be `True` (`4**0 = 1`).

4.  **Main Logic (`x > 1` and `n > 1`):**
    *   If `x` is a power of `n`, we should be able to repeatedly divide `x` by `n` until it becomes `1`.
    *   We use a `while` loop: As long as `x` is greater than `1`, we check if it's divisible by `n`.
        *   If `x` is not divisible by `n` at any point, then it cannot be a power of `n`. Return `False`.
        *   If it is divisible, divide `x` by `n` (using integer division `//`).
    *   If the loop finishes (meaning `x` has been reduced to `1`), then `x` was indeed a power of `n`. Return `True`.

Let's trace `is_simple_power(8, 2)`:
- `x=8`, `n=2`.
- `x < 1` is false.
- `n < 1` is false.
- `n == 1` is false.
- `x == 1` is false.
- `temp_x = 8`.
- Loop `while temp_x > 1` (`8 > 1` is true):
    - `8 % 2 != 0` is false.
    - `temp_x = 8 // 2 = 4`.
- Loop `while temp_x > 1` (`4 > 1` is true):
    - `4 % 2 != 0` is false.
    - `temp_x = 4 // 2 = 2`.
- Loop `while temp_x > 1` (`2 > 1` is true):
    - `2 % 2 != 0` is false.
    - `temp_x = 2 // 2 = 1`.
- Loop `while temp_x > 1` (`1 > 1` is false): Loop terminates.
- Return `temp_x == 1` (which is `1 == 1`), so `True`.

Let's trace `is_simple_power(3, 2)`:
- `x=3`, `n=2`.
- `x < 1` is false.
- `n < 1` is false.
- `n == 1` is false.
- `x == 1` is false.
- `temp_x = 3`.
- Loop `while temp_x > 1` (`3 > 1` is true):
    - `3 % 2 != 0` is true. Return `False`.

### Explanation:
- We need to iterate through the list using the index and value.
- For each element, check if its index is even (0-based, so indices like 0, 2, 4, etc.).
- If the index is even, then check if the element is odd (i.e., not divisible by 2).
- If both conditions are met, add the element to a running total.
- Return the total sum at the end.

The idea is to iterate through the list and for each element, check if there are two other distinct elements that can sum with it to zero. Here's how we can do this step by step:

1. Iterate through each element in the list.
2. For each element, use a set to keep track of the numbers we have seen so far.
3. For each subsequent element, check if the negation of the current element minus the first element exists in the set.
4. If we find such a pair, return `True`.

### Explanation:
- We first check if the list has fewer than 3 elements, in which case we return `False`.
- We sort the list to facilitate the two-pointer technique.
- We iterate through the list, using a nested loop with two pointers (`left` and `right`) to find pairs that, along with the current element, sum to zero.
- We skip duplicates to ensure distinct elements are considered.
- If we find a triplet that sums to zero, we return `True`. If no such triplet is found after checking all possibilities, we return `False`.

Since the prompt specifies that the list will always have an even number of coefficients and guarantees a solution, we can use the bisection method or Newton's method for root finding.

Here, I will implement the `find_zero` function using the `scipy.optimize` library, which provides a convenient method for finding roots. We will use the `fsolve` function, which is suitable for this task.

humaneval,HumanEval/69,Random,1,"To solve this problem, we need to find the frequency of each number in the list and then check which numbers satisfy the given condition. We are looking for the *greatest* such integer.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1.  **Count Frequencies**: First, we need to determine how many times each unique integer appears in the input list. A hash map (dictionary in Python) or `collections.Counter` is ideal for this.
2.  **Identify Candidates**: Iterate through the unique numbers found in the list. For each number `x`, check if its frequency (let's call it `freq_x`) is greater than or equal to `x` itself (i.e., `freq_x >= x`).
3.  **Find the Greatest**: Since we need the *greatest* integer that satisfies the condition, it's efficient to iterate through the unique numbers in *descending order*. The first number we find that meets the condition will automatically be the greatest such integer.
4.  **Handle No Candidates**: If after checking all unique numbers no integer satisfies the condition, we should return -1.

Let's illustrate with an example: `lst = [4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]`

1.  **Count Frequencies**:
    Using `collections.Counter`, we get `counts = {4: 1, 1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 1}`.

2.  **Unique Numbers (sorted descending)**:
    The unique numbers are `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Sorted descending, they are `[4, 3, 2, 1]`.

3.  **Iterate and Check**:
    *   **`num = 4`**: `counts[4]` is 1. Is `1 >= 4`? No.
    *   **`num = 3`**: `counts[3]` is 1. Is `1 >= 3`? No.
    *   **`num = 2`**: `counts[2]` is 2. Is `2 >= 2`? Yes. This number satisfies the condition. Since we are iterating in descending order, this `2` is the greatest valid number found so far. We can immediately return `2`.

    If the loop finished without finding any such number, we would return -1.

```python
import collections

def search(lst):
    '''
    You are given a non-empty list of positive integers. Return the greatest integer that is greater than 
    zero, and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself. 
    The frequency of an integer is the number of times it appears in the list.
    If no such a value exist, return -1.
    Examples:
        search([4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]) == 2
        search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) == 3
        search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]) == -1
    '''
    # Step 1: Count the frequency of each number in the list.
    # collections.Counter is very efficient for this.
    counts = collections.Counter(lst)

    # Step 2: Get all unique numbers from the list and sort them in descending order.
    # Sorting in descending order allows us to return the first number that satisfies
    # the condition, as it will automatically be the greatest.
    unique_numbers = sorted(counts.keys(), reverse=True)

    # Step 3: Iterate through the unique numbers (from greatest to smallest).
    for num in unique_numbers:
        # Check if the frequency of 'num' is greater than or equal to 'num' itself.
        # The problem states 'positive integers', so num > 0 is implicitly handled.
        if counts[num] >= num:
            # If the condition is met, 'num' is the greatest such integer
            # because we are iterating in descending order.
            return num
            
    # Step 4: If no such integer is found after checking all unique numbers, return -1.

### Explanation:
1. **Base Cases**: The function first checks for the base cases where `n` is 0, 1, or 2, returning the corresponding values directly.
2. **Iterative Calculation**: For values of `n` greater than 2, it initializes a list to store the computed FibFib numbers. It then iteratively computes each subsequent number using the formula `fibfib(n) = fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-3)`.
3. **Return the Result**: Finally, it returns the n-th FibFib number.

1. The function first checks if there are any whitespace characters in the input string. If found, it splits the string using whitespace and returns the resulting list.
2. If no whitespace is found, it checks for commas. If commas are present, it splits the string using commas and returns the resulting list.
3. If neither whitespace nor commas are present, it counts the number of lowercase letters that have an odd position in the alphabet (i.e., 'b', 'd', 'f', ..., 'z') and returns that count. The position is determined using the `ord()` function.",0.00028695,3.5796058177948,0,0,gpt-4o-mini,,

humaneval,HumanEval/151,Random,1,"The goal is to write a Python function `double_the_difference` that processes a list of numbers.
It should calculate the sum of squares of numbers that meet specific criteria:
1.  **Positive**: The number must be greater than or equal to 0. (The problem states ""ignore numbers that are negative"").
2.  **Integer**: The number must be an integer, or a float that represents a whole number (e.g., `3.0` should be treated as `3`, but `3.5` should be ignored). The problem states ""ignore numbers that... not integers"".
3.  **Odd**: Among the numbers that are positive and integers, only the odd ones should be considered.

Let's break down the implementation steps:

1.  **Initialize `total_sum`**: Start with a variable `total_sum = 0` to accumulate the squares.
2.  **Iterate through the list**: Loop through each `num` in the input `lst`.
3.  **Filter for number type**: Ensure `num` is an actual number (`int` or `float`). This helps to ignore non-numeric types like strings or `None`.
4.  **Filter for non-negativity and integer value**:
    *   Check `num >= 0` to ensure it's not negative.
    *   Check `num == int(num)` to ensure it's an integer value. This handles cases like `3.0` (which evaluates to `True`) while correctly ignoring `3.5` (which evaluates to `False`).
5.  **Filter for oddness**: If the above conditions are met, convert `num` to an integer using `int(num)` and then check if `int(num) % 2 != 0`.
6.  **Calculate square and add to sum**: If a number passes all checks, square its integer value (`int(num) ** 2`) and add it to `total_sum`.
7.  **Return `total_sum`**: After iterating through all elements, return the final `total_sum`.

**Example Walkthrough:** `double_the_difference([1, 3, 2, 0, -1, 3.5, 5.0])`

*   `total_sum = 0`
*   `num = 1`:
    *   `isinstance(1, (int, float))` is `True`.

    *   `1 == int(1)` is `True`.
    *   `int(1) % 2 != 0` (i.e., `1 % 2 != 0`) is `True`.
    *   `total_sum = 0 + (1 ** 2) = 1`.
*   `num = 3`:
    *   Passes all checks.
    *   `total_sum = 1 + (3 ** 2) = 1 + 9 = 10`.

    *   Passes non-negative and integer checks.
    *   `int(2) % 2 != 0` (i.e., `2 % 2 != 0`) is `False` (2 is even).
    *   `total_sum` remains `10`.
*   `num = 0`:
    *   Passes non-negative and integer checks.

    *   `3.5 >= 0` is `True`.
    *   `3.5 == int(3.5)` (i.e., `3.5 == 3`) is `False`.
    *   `total_sum` remains `10`.
*   `num = 5.0`:
    *   `isinstance(5.0, (int, float))` is `True`.
    *   `5.0 >= 0` is `True`.
    *   `5.0 == int(5.0)` (i.e., `5.0 == 5`) is `True`.

humaneval,HumanEval/131,Random,1,"To solve this problem, we need to compute the product of the odd digits in a given positive integer. If all digits are even, we return 0. 

### Approach
1. **Convert the integer to a string**: This allows us to iterate over each digit easily.
2. **Initialize a product variable**: Start with `product = 1` since we will be multiplying digits.
3. **Check each digit**:
   - Convert each character in the string back to an integer.
   - If the digit is odd (i.e., `digit % 2 != 0`), multiply it with the current product.
4. **Handle edge cases**:
   - If no odd digits are found, the product remains `1`. In this case, return `0`.
   - Otherwise, return the computed product.

### Solution Code
```python
def digits(n):
    product = 1
    found_odd = False
    for d in str(n):
        digit = int(d)
        if digit % 2 != 0:
            product *= digit
            found_odd = True
    return product if found_odd else 0
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: We start with `product = 1` and a flag `found_odd = False` to track if any odd digits are encountered.
2. **Iteration**: For each digit in the integer converted to a string:
   - Convert the digit character back to an integer.
   - Check if the digit is odd using `digit % 2 != 0`.
   - If it is odd, multiply it with `product` and set `found_odd = True`.

```python
def add(lst):
    """"""
    Given a non-empty list of integers lst, add the even elements that are at odd indices.

            total += num  # Add the even number to the total
    return total  # Return the final sum
```

### Explanation:
- **Looping with `enumerate`**: This gives both the index (`i`) and the value (`num`) for each element in the list.
- **Condition check**: 
  - `i % 2 != 0` ensures the index is odd (e.g., 1, 3, 5, ...).
  - `num % 2 == 0` ensures the number is even.
- **Edge cases handled**:
  - If the list has no even elements at odd indices, the function returns 0.
  - The list is assumed to be non-empty as per the docstring.

You can test this function like this:
```python
print(add([4, 2, 6, 7]))  # Output: 2
print(add([1, 3, 5]))     # Output: 0 (no even elements at odd indices)
print(add([2]))           # Output: 0 (index 0 is even, so not added)

# print(histogram('b b b b a'))  # Output: {'b': 4}
# print(histogram(''))  # Output: {}

### Explanation:
- **Input Handling:** The function first checks if the input string is empty or splits to an empty list, returning an empty dictionary in those cases.
- **Splitting the String:** `test.split()` splits the string into a list of substrings based on spaces.
- **Counting Frequencies:** I use `collections.Counter` to efficiently count the occurrences of each letter.
- **Finding the Maximum Frequency:** `max(counter.values())` gets the highest count.
- **Filtering Results:** A dictionary comprehension creates a new dictionary that only includes letters with the maximum frequency.
- **Output:** The function returns a dictionary as specified, with no particular order for the keys (as dictionaries in Python 3.7+ maintain insertion order, but the problem doesn't require a specific order).

            result.append(word)  # Add the original word to the result list
    
    return result  # Return the list of qualifying words
```

### Explanation:
- **Empty String Check**: If `s` is an empty string, the function immediately returns an empty list.
- **Splitting the String**: `s.split()` splits the string into a list of words based on spaces.
- **Consonant Counting**: For each word, we convert it to lowercase and iterate through its characters. We check if a character is a letter (`isalpha()`) and not a vowel. If it meets these conditions, it's counted as a consonant.
- **Result Building**: Only words with exactly `n` consonants are added to the result list, using the original casing of the word.
- **Edge Cases Handled**:
  - Strings with only spaces (e.g., ""   "") will result in an empty list after splitting.
  - Words with no consonants or more/less than `n` consonants are ignored.

### Example Usage:
You can test the function in a Python environment like this:

```python
# Example 1
print(select_words(""Mary had a little lamb"", 4))  # Output: ['little']

# Example 2
print(select_words(""Mary had a little lamb"", 3))  # Output: ['Mary', 'lamb']

### Explanation:

2. It iterates over the first `k` elements of the input array `arr`.
3. For each element, it checks if the element is between -100 and 100 (exclusive), which means it has at most two digits.

    return f""{class_name}.{strongest_extension}""

print(Strongest_Extension('my_class', ['AA', 'Be', 'CC']))  # Output: my_class.AA
```

### Explanation:
- **Helper Function (`calculate_strength`)**: This function computes the strength of a single extension by counting uppercase letters (using `isupper()`) and lowercase letters (using `islower()`), then returns the difference (CAP - SM).
- **Main Function**:
  - It first checks if the `extensions` list is empty and raises an error if it is, to handle this edge case gracefully.
  - It uses Python's `max()` function with a `key` argument to select the extension with the highest strength. The `key` function is `calculate_strength`, which ensures we're comparing based on strength values.
  - If multiple extensions have the same strength, `max()` will return the first one in the list, as per Python's behavior for ties.
  - Finally, it constructs and returns the result string in the format `{class_name}.{strongest_extension}`.
- **Edge Cases Handled**:
  - Empty list: Raises a `ValueError`.
  - Single extension: Works as expected.
  - Ties: The first occurrence is selected.
  - Extensions with no letters (e.g., numbers or symbols): Their strength will be 0, and they are compared normally.

humaneval,HumanEval/123,Random,1,"Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Generate the Collatz sequence starting from n
2. Collect only the odd numbers from that sequence
3. Return them sorted in increasing order

Let me trace through the example:
- n = 5
- Sequence: 5 (odd) → 16 (even) → 8 (even) → 4 (even) → 2 (even) → 1 (odd)
- Odd numbers: [5, 1]
- Sorted: [1, 5]

Here's the solution:

```python
def get_odd_collatz(n):
    """"""
    Given a positive integer n, return a sorted list that has the odd numbers in collatz sequence.

    The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined
    as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the 
    previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of 
    the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous
    term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.

    Note: 
        1. Collatz(1) is [1].
        2. returned list sorted in increasing order.

    For example:
    get_odd_collatz(5) returns [1, 5] # The collatz sequence for 5 is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1], so the odd numbers are only 1, and 5.
    """"""
    odd_numbers = []
    current = n
    
    while current != 1:
        if current % 2 == 1:  # current is odd

            current = 3 * current + 1

    # Add 1 (the final number in the sequence)
    odd_numbers.append(1)
    
    # Return sorted list
    return sorted(odd_numbers)
```

**Testing with the example:**
- `get_odd_collatz(5)`:
  - 5 is odd → add 5, next = 16
  - 16 is even → next = 8
  - 8 is even → next = 4
  - 4 is even → next = 2
  - 2 is even → next = 1
  - Loop ends, add 1
  - odd_numbers = [5, 1]
  - sorted = [1, 5] ✓

### Explanation:
1. **Input Validation**: The function checks if the base is valid (between 2 and 9).
2. **Zero Case**: If `x` is 0, it immediately returns '0'.
3. **Conversion Loop**: It uses a while loop to divide `x` by `base`, collecting the remainders.
4. **Reversing Digits**: Since the digits are collected in reverse order, we reverse the list of digits before joining them into a string.

humaneval,HumanEval/101,Random,1,"To solve this problem, we need to split a given string into an array of words where the words are separated by commas or spaces. The solution should handle cases where there are multiple consecutive commas or spaces, and it should also handle leading or trailing delimiters efficiently.

### Approach
The approach involves two main steps:
1. **Replace Commas with Spaces**: Convert all commas in the input string into spaces. This standardizes the delimiters to spaces only.
2. **Split by Whitespace**: Use the `split()` method without any arguments to split the string into words. This method automatically handles multiple consecutive spaces and removes any leading or trailing whitespace, resulting in a clean list of words.

This method ensures that all commas and spaces are treated uniformly as delimiters, and consecutive delimiters do not result in empty strings in the final output.

### Solution Code
```python
def words_string(s):
    return s.replace(',', ' ').split()
```

### Explanation
1. **Replacing Commas with Spaces**: The `replace(',', ' ')` method call converts every comma in the string into a space. For example, the string `""Hi, my name is John""` becomes `""Hi  my name is John""`.
2. **Splitting the String**: The `split()` method is then used on the modified string. This method splits the string at any sequence of whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines, etc.), effectively separating the words. Consecutive whitespace characters are treated as a single delimiter, and any leading or trailing whitespace is ignored. Thus, the string `""Hi  my name is John""` is split into the list `[""Hi"", ""my"", ""name"", ""is"", ""John""]`.

This approach efficiently handles all specified cases, including strings with mixed commas and spaces, multiple consecutive delimiters, and leading or trailing delimiters.

humaneval,HumanEval/147,Random,1,"To solve this problem, we need to count triples `(a[i], a[j], a[k])` such that `i < j < k` and `a[i] + a[j] + a[k]` is a multiple of 3. This condition is equivalent to `(a[i] % 3 + a[j] % 3 + a[k] % 3) % 3 == 0`.

Let's first analyze the pattern of `a[x] % 3` for `a[x] = x*x - x + 1`. We can rewrite `a[x]` as `x*(x-1) + 1`.

We'll consider the value of `x % 3`:

1.  **If `x % 3 == 0`**:
    Let `x = 3m` for some integer `m`.
    `a[x] = (3m) * (3m - 1) + 1`.
    Since `(3m) * (3m - 1)` is a multiple of 3, `a[x] % 3 = 1`.

2.  **If `x % 3 == 1`**:
    Let `x = 3m + 1` for some integer `m`.
    `a[x] = (3m + 1) * (3m) + 1`.
    Since `(3m + 1) * (3m)` is a multiple of 3, `a[x] % 3 = 1`.

3.  **If `x % 3 == 2`**:
    Let `x = 3m + 2` for some integer `m`.
    `a[x] = (3m + 2) * (3m + 1) + 1`.
    `a[x] = (9m^2 + 3m + 6m + 2) + 1`.
    `a[x] = 9m^2 + 9m + 3`.
    Since `9m^2 + 9m + 3` is a multiple of 3, `a[x] % 3 = 0`.

**Summary of `a[x] % 3`:**
*   `a[x] % 3 == 0` if `x % 3 == 2`.
*   `a[x] % 3 == 1` if `x % 3 == 0` or `x % 3 == 1`.

Now, we need to find triples `(a[i], a[j], a[k])` such that `(a[i]%3 + a[j]%3 + a[k]%3) % 3 == 0`.
Given that `a[x]%3` can only be `0` or `1`, the only combinations of remainders that sum to a multiple of 3 are:
1.  `(0, 0, 0)`: sum = `0 + 0 + 0 = 0`, which is divisible by 3.
2.  `(1, 1, 1)`: sum = `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`, which is divisible by 3.
Any other combination (e.g., `(0,0,1)` sums to 1, `(0,1,1)` sums to 2) will not work.

So, the problem reduces to:
1.  Count how many elements `a[x]` in the array have a remainder of 0 when divided by 3. Let this be `count0_rem`.
2.  Count how many elements `a[x]` in the array have a remainder of 1 when divided by 3. Let this be `count1_rem`.

The number of ways to choose 3 distinct elements with remainder 0 from `count0_rem` elements is `math.comb(count0_rem, 3)`.
The number of ways to choose 3 distinct elements with remainder 1 from `count1_rem` elements is `math.comb(count1_rem, 3)`.

The total number of valid triples will be `math.comb(count0_rem, 3) + math.comb(count1_rem, 3)`.

To find `count0_rem` and `count1_rem`, we need to count how many `x` in the range `[1, n]` satisfy `x % 3 == 0`, `x % 3 == 1`, or `x % 3 == 2`.

*   **`num_x_mod_0`**: Number of `x` in `[1, n]` such that `x % 3 == 0`.
    These are `3, 6, ..., 3 * (n // 3)`. The count is `n // 3`.
*   **`num_x_mod_1`**: Number of `x` in `[1, n]` such that `x % 3 == 1`.
    These are `1, 4, ..., 3k+1 <= n`. The count is `(n - 1) // 3 + 1`, which simplifies to `(n + 2) // 3`.
*   **`num_x_mod_2`**: Number of `x` in `[1, n]` such that `x % 3 == 2`.
    These are `2, 5, ..., 3k+2 <= n`. The count is `(n - 2) // 3 + 1`, which simplifies to `(n + 1) // 3`.

Now, we map these counts to `count0_rem` and `count1_rem`:
*   `count0_rem` = `num_x_mod_2` (since `a[x]%3 == 0` when `x%3 == 2`).
*   `count1_rem` = `num_x_mod_0 + num_x_mod_1` (since `a[x]%3 == 1` when `x%3 == 0` or `x%3 == 1`).

Finally, we sum the combinations.

**Example for n = 5:**
*   `num_x_mod_0 = 5 // 3 = 1` (for `x=3`)
*   `num_x_mod_1 = (5 + 2) // 3 = 2` (for `x=1, 4`)
*   `num_x_mod_2 = (5 + 1) // 3 = 2` (for `x=2, 5`)

*   `count0_rem = num_x_mod_2 = 2` (These correspond to `a[2]` and `a[5]`, which are 3 and 21)
*   `count1_rem = num_x_mod_0 + num_x_mod_1 = 1 + 2 = 3` (These correspond to `a[1], a[3], a[4]`, which are 1, 7, and 13)

*   Triples of type `(0, 0, 0)`: `math.comb(count0_rem, 3) = math.comb(2, 3) = 0`.
*   Triples of type `(1, 1, 1)`: `math.comb(count1_rem, 3) = math.comb(3, 3) = 1`.

Total valid triples = `0 + 1 = 1`. This matches the example output.

        else:
            modified_num = num  # No change
        result += modified_num  # Add the modified (or original) number to the sum
    
    return result

# print(sum_squares([]))        # Output: 0
# print(sum_squares([-1, -5, 2, -1, -5]))  # Output: -126
```

### Explanation:
- **Input Handling**: The function checks if the list is empty and returns 0 immediately, as specified.
- **Loop with enumerate**: We use `enumerate(lst)` to get both the index and the value for each element.
- **Conditions**:
  - If the index is a multiple of 3 (`index % 3 == 0`), we square the number using `num ** 2`.
  - If the index is a multiple of 4 and not caught by the previous condition (`index % 4 == 0`), we cube the number using `num ** 3`.
  - Otherwise, we use the original number.
- **Summing**: We accumulate the modified values in the `result` variable and return it at the end.
- **Edge Cases**: This handles empty lists, lists with negative numbers, and lists of various lengths.

humaneval,HumanEval/19,Random,1,"To sort the numbers represented as words, we need a way to convert them into comparable numerical values, sort those values, and then convert them back to words.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1.  **Create Mappings**:
    *   A dictionary to map number words (e.g., 'one') to their integer equivalents (e.g., 1). This is used for sorting.
    *   A list (or another dictionary) to map integers back to their corresponding number words. A list is convenient here because the index can directly represent the integer.

2.  **Split Input String**: The input string is space-delimited, so we split it into a list of individual number words.

3.  **Convert to Integers**: Iterate through the list of number words and use the word-to-integer mapping to create a list of integer values.

4.  **Sort Integers**: Sort the list of integer values in ascending order.

5.  **Convert Back to Words**: Iterate through the sorted list of integers and use the integer-to-word mapping to create a new list of sorted number words.

6.  **Join Words**: Join the sorted number words back into a single space-delimited string.

humaneval,HumanEval/66,Random,1,"To solve this problem, we need to write a function that calculates the sum of the ASCII values of all uppercase characters in a given string. The solution involves iterating through each character in the string, checking if it is uppercase, and accumulating the ASCII values of these characters.

### Approach
1. **Initialize a Sum Variable**: Start with a sum variable set to zero to accumulate the ASCII values.
2. **Iterate Through Characters**: For each character in the input string:
   - **Check if Uppercase**: Use the `isupper()` method to determine if the character is uppercase.
   - **Add ASCII Value**: If the character is uppercase, convert it to its ASCII value using `ord()` and add it to the sum.
3. **Return the Sum**: After processing all characters, return the accumulated sum.

### Solution Code
```python
def digitSum(s):
    total = 0
    for char in s:
        if char.isupper():
            total += ord(char)
    return total
```

### Explanation
- **Initialization**: The variable `total` is initialized to 0 to store the cumulative sum of ASCII values.
- **Character Processing**: The loop iterates over each character in the input string `s`.
- **Uppercase Check**: For each character, `char.isupper()` checks if it is uppercase. This method returns `True` for uppercase characters (e.g., 'A'-'Z').
- **Summing ASCII Values**: If a character is uppercase, `ord(char)` converts it to its ASCII value (e.g., 'A' → 65, 'B' → 66), which is added to `total`.
- **Result**: The function returns `total`, which contains the sum of ASCII values for all uppercase characters encountered.

This approach efficiently processes the string in a single pass, ensuring optimal performance with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string. The solution handles edge cases like empty strings correctly (returning 0).",0.00170799,9.052733182907104,0,0,deepseek-r1,,

    while i * i <= n:  # Loop up to sqrt(n)

            n = n // i  # Divide n by i
        i += 2  # Move to the next odd number
    
    # If n is a prime number greater than 2, it will be the largest factor
    if n > 1:
        largest = n  # Update largest to n if it's greater than 1
    
    return largest
```

### Explanation:
- **Step 1:** First, we divide `n` by 2 as many times as possible and set `largest` to 2.
- **Step 2:** Then, we check for odd factors starting from 3 up to the square root of `n`. For each factor found, we update `largest`.
- **Step 3:** After the loop, if `n` is still greater than 1, it means `n` is a prime factor itself, so we update `largest` to `n`.
- This approach ensures we only process necessary divisions and handle the examples correctly (e.g., `largest_prime_factor(13195)` returns 29, and `largest_prime_factor(2048)` returns 2).

### Explanation:
- The function `is_palindrome` checks if a string is the same forwards and backwards.
- In `make_palindrome`, we loop through the string to find the longest palindromic suffix by checking each substring starting from index `i` to the end.
- Once we find a palindromic suffix, we take the prefix (the part of the string before the palindromic suffix), reverse it, and append it to the original string.
- If the entire string is a palindrome, we simply return the string concatenated with its reverse.

- Uses modulo 26 to wrap around (e.g., 'x' + 5 = 'c')
- Formula: `((ord(ch) + 5 - ord(""a"")) % 26) + ord(""a"")`

**To decode:**
- I need to shift backward by 5 positions
- Simply replace `+ 5` with `- 5` in the formula

Here's the solution:

```python
def decode_shift(s: str):
    """"""
    takes as input string encoded with encode_shift function. Returns decoded string.
    """"""
    return """".join([chr(((ord(ch) - 5 - ord(""a"")) % 26) + ord(""a"")) for ch in s])
```

**How it works:**
1. For each character `ch` in the encoded string
2. Convert to position in alphabet: `ord(ch) - ord(""a"")` (0-25)
3. Shift backward by 5: subtract 5
4. Apply modulo 26 to handle wrap-around (e.g., 'b' - 5 = 'w')
5. Convert back to character: add `ord(""a"")` and use `chr()`

**Example:**
- If encoded character is 'f' (shifted from 'a')
- Position: ord('f') - ord('a') = 5
- Shift back: 5 - 5 = 0
- Result: chr(0 + ord('a')) = 'a' ✓",0.0066569999999999,7.97078537940979,0,0,claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,,

### Explanation:
- **Helper Function `is_prime(n)`**: This checks if a given number `n` is prime. It uses an optimized approach to test divisibility up to the square root of `n`.
- **Main Function `words_in_sentence(sentence)`**:
  - `sentence.split()`: Splits the input string into a list of words based on spaces.
  - List comprehension: Iterates through the words and includes only those whose lengths are prime.
  - `' '.join(filtered_words)`: Joins the filtered words into a single string, separated by spaces. If no words qualify, it returns an empty string.

### Example Walkthrough:
1. **Input: ""This is a test""**
   - Words: [""This"", ""is"", ""a"", ""test""]
   - Lengths: [4, 2, 1, 4]
   - Prime lengths: 2 (only ""is"")
   - Output: ""is""

2. **Input: ""lets go for swimming""**
   - Words: [""lets"", ""go"", ""for"", ""swimming""]
   - Lengths: [4, 2, 3, 8]
   - Prime lengths: 2 and 3 (""go"" and ""for"")
   - Output: ""go for""

- **Line 4-5**: Initialize variables to track the maximum unique character count and the best string.
- **Line 7-14**: Loop through each word:
  - Compute the unique characters using `set(word)`, which removes duplicates.
  - If the current word has more unique characters than the maximum seen so far, update the maximum and set it as the best string.
  - If it has the same number of unique characters, compare it lexicographically with the current best string and update if it's smaller.
- **Line 16**: Return the best string after processing all words.
