gsm8k,gsm8k-205,Random,1,"Here's how to solve this problem:

1.  **Determine the target sum for the five highest scores:**
    Since one score is dropped, Brinley needs an average of 93 across 5 scores.
    Total sum needed = Average * Number of scores = 93 * 5 = 465

2.  **Identify Brinley's current scores and the lowest among them:**
    Her scores are: 89, 71, 92, 100, 86
    The lowest score currently is 71.

3.  **Assume the lowest current score (71) will be dropped:**
    This is the most common scenario for ""what score do you need"" problems, as you're typically trying to score high enough so that your *existing* low score is still the one dropped. If Brinley scores lower than 71, *that* score would be dropped, and the 71 would then count, making it harder to reach the average.

4.  **Sum the four highest existing scores:**
    These are the scores that would definitely count if 71 is dropped: 89, 92, 100, 86.
    Sum = 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367

5.  **Calculate the score needed on the sixth test:**
    Let 'X' be the score on the sixth test.
    The sum of the five scores that count (the four highest existing + X) must equal 465.
    367 + X = 465
    X = 465 - 367
    X = 98

6.  **Verify:**
    If Brinley scores 98, her six scores are: 89, 71, 92, 100, 86, 98.
    The lowest is 71, so it's dropped.
    The scores averaged are: 89, 92, 100, 86, 98.
    Sum = 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 + 98 = 465

1. **Cost of the jacket**: $30
2. **Cost of 2 pairs of shoes**: 2 pairs × $20/pair = $40

Now, we can find the total cost:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of jacket} + \text{Cost of shoes} = 30 + 40 = 70
\]

Next, we calculate how much money Sara has after babysitting and her initial savings.

1. **Earnings from babysitting**: She babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from babysitting} = 4 \times 5 = 20

2. **Total money Sara has before mowing the lawn**:
   \[
   \text{Total money} = \text{Initial savings} + \text{Earnings from babysitting} = 10 + 20 = 30

gsm8k,gsm8k-211,Random,1,"Let 'r' be the number of red chickens and 'w' be the number of white chickens.

We can set up two equations based on the information given:

1.  **Egg production:** The total number of eggs collected daily is 42.
    *   Red chickens produce 3 eggs each: `3r`
    *   White chickens produce 5 eggs each: `5w`
    *   So, `3r + 5w = 42`

2.  **Number of chickens:** Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens.
    *   `w = r + 2`

Now we can solve this system of equations using substitution. Substitute the value of `w` from the second equation into the first equation:

`3r + 5(r + 2) = 42`

Now, distribute the 5:
`3r + 5r + 10 = 42`

Combine like terms:
`8r + 10 = 42`

Subtract 10 from both sides:
`8r = 42 - 10`
`8r = 32`

Divide by 8:
`r = 32 / 8`
`r = 4`

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

To verify, if he has 4 red chickens, then he has `4 + 2 = 6` white chickens.
Eggs from red chickens: `4 * 3 = 12`
Eggs from white chickens: `6 * 5 = 30`
Total eggs: `12 + 30 = 42`

gsm8k,gsm8k-212,Random,1,"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the edge of the rectangular park, let's reason through the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the problem
- The park is a rectangle with dimensions 1.5 miles by 6 miles.
- Walking around the edge means Gary is walking the perimeter of the rectangle.
- His walking speed is 3 miles per hour.

### Step 2: Calculate the perimeter
- The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:  
  \( P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \)
- Here, length = 6 miles and width = 1.5 miles.  
  \( P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \) miles.

### Step 3: Calculate the time spent walking
- Time is calculated using the formula:  
  \( \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \)
- Distance = 15 miles (the perimeter).  
- Speed = 3 miles per hour.  
  \( \text{Time} = \frac{15}{3} = 5 \) hours.

- Let `S_now` be the amount of water in the small pool now.
- Let `B_now` be the amount of water in the big pool now.

We are told that 4 minutes ago, the leaks had been emptying the pools at 4 gallons/minute.
So, in 4 minutes, each pool lost `4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons` of water.

Let `S_4min_ago` be the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago.
Let `B_4min_ago` be the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago.

We can relate the current amounts to the amounts 4 minutes ago:
1. `S_now = S_4min_ago - 16`  =>  `S_4min_ago = S_now + 16`
2. `B_now = B_4min_ago - 16`  =>  `B_4min_ago = B_now + 16`

We are given two conditions based on the ratios of water in the pools:
Condition A (4 minutes ago): The big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
`B_4min_ago = 2 * S_4min_ago`

Condition B (Now): The big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.
`B_now = 4 * S_now`

Now, let's substitute the expressions for `S_4min_ago` and `B_4min_ago` from steps 1 and 2 into Condition A:
`(B_now + 16) = 2 * (S_now + 16)`

Expand the equation:
`B_now + 16 = 2 * S_now + 32`

Now we have a system of two equations with `B_now` and `S_now`:
(1) `B_now = 4 * S_now` (from Condition B)
(2) `B_now + 16 = 2 * S_now + 32`

Substitute equation (1) into equation (2):
`(4 * S_now) + 16 = 2 * S_now + 32`

Now, solve for `S_now`:
`4 * S_now - 2 * S_now = 32 - 16`
`2 * S_now = 16`
`S_now = 16 / 2`
`S_now = 8`

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

Let's check the answer:
If `S_now = 8` gallons:
- `B_now = 4 * S_now = 4 * 8 = 32` gallons.

4 minutes ago:
- `S_4min_ago = S_now + 16 = 8 + 16 = 24` gallons.
- `B_4min_ago = B_now + 16 = 32 + 16 = 48` gallons.

Check Condition A: `B_4min_ago = 2 * S_4min_ago`
`48 = 2 * 24`
`48 = 48` (This is correct)

Check Condition B: `B_now = 4 * S_now`
`32 = 4 * 8`
`32 = 32` (This is correct)

The answer is consistent with all conditions.

### Step 1: Understand the values
- 1 penny = $0.01
- 1 nickel = $0.05
- 1 dime = $0.10
- 1 dollar bill = $1.00

### Step 2: Calculate the value of each type
- **Pennies:** Brady has 100 pennies.  
  Value = 100 × $0.01 = $1.00
- **Nickels:** Brady has 40 nickels.  
  Value = 40 × $0.05 = $2.00
- **Dimes:** Brady has 20 dimes.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of 10-foot sections in the tree.
- The tree is 200 feet tall.
- Each section is 10 feet long.
- Number of sections = 200 feet ÷ 10 feet per section = 20 sections.

### Step 2: Calculate the original total weight of the tree.
- Each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds.
- Total weight = 20 sections × 400 pounds per section = 8,000 pounds.

### Step 3: Account for the termites eating 30% of the wood.
- If 30% of the wood is eaten, then 70% of the wood remains.
- Remaining weight = Original weight × 70% = 8,000 pounds × 0.70 = 5,600 pounds.

From the problem, we have the following two equations:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
   \[
   R = 6S
   \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
   \[
   R + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

Substituting \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
\]

Now, simplify the right side:
\[
6S + 9 = 3S + 27
\]

Next, we can isolate \( S \) by moving all terms involving \( S \) to one side and constant terms to the other side:
\[
6S - 3S = 27 - 9
\]
\[
3S = 18
\]

Now, divide both sides by 3:
\[
S = 6
\]

So, Sam is currently **6 years old**.

To find Ruby's age, we can substitute \( S \) back into the first equation:

R = 6S = 6 \times 6 = 36

Thus, Ruby is currently **36 years old**.

To verify, in 9 years:
- Sam will be \( 6 + 9 = 15 \)

And indeed, \( 45 \) is \( 3 \times 15 \), confirming our solution is correct.

1. **Calculate the total rice consumption per meal for the household:**
   Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Therefore, for 5 members:
   \[
   \text{Total consumption per meal} = 5 \text{ members} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/member} = 1 \text{ kg/meal}

1. **Total books**: Elise started with 250 books.
2. **Unsold books**: Currently, there are 50 unsold books.
3. **Books sold this year**: Elise sold 45 books this year.

From the total number of books and the unsold books, we can calculate the total number of books sold over the three years:

\[
\text{Total books sold} = \text{Total books} - \text{Unsold books} = 250 - 50 = 200
\]

Next, we know that Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she sold this year. Let \( x \) be the number of books sold this year (which is 45). Therefore, the number of books sold in the first year is:

\[
\text{Books sold in the first year} = 2x = 2 \times 45 = 90
\]

Now, we can find the number of books sold in the second year. The total number of books sold over the three years is 200, so:

\[
\text{Books sold in the second year} = \text{Total books sold} - \text{Books sold in the first year} - \text{Books sold this year}

Substituting the known values:

\[
\text{Books sold in the second year} = 200 - 90 - 45 = 65

The serum causes an extra arm to grow every 3 days and an extra leg to grow every 5 days. We'll calculate the number of arms and legs separately and then add them together for the total.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of extra arms
- An extra arm grows every 3 days.
- Starting from day 0 (when the serum is drunk), the arms grow on days that are multiples of 3: day 3, day 6, day 9, day 12, and day 15.
- This gives us: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 (a total of 5 days).
- Therefore, 5 extra arms grow.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of extra legs
- An extra leg grows every 5 days.
- Starting from day 0, the legs grow on days that are multiples of 5: day 5, day 10, and day 15.
- This gives us: 5, 10, 15 (a total of 3 days).
- Therefore, 3 extra legs grow.

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of new limbs
- New limbs include both arms and legs.
- Total new limbs = number of extra arms + number of extra legs = 5 + 3 = 8.

**Step 1: Find Cera's age six years ago**
- Current age of Cera = 46 years old
- Cera's age six years ago = 46 - 6 = 40 years old

**Step 2: Find Noah's age six years ago**
- Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera

gsm8k,gsm8k-314,Random,1,"Let the number of players on the defense be \( d \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is \( 2d \) (twice as many as on the defense).
- The number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{d}{2} \) (half the number of players on the defense).

The total number of members in the team is given as 105. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
d + 2d + \frac{d}{2} = 105
\]

Now, let's combine the terms on the left side:

\[
3d + \frac{d}{2} = 105
\]

To combine \( 3d \) and \( \frac{d}{2} \), we can convert \( 3d \) into a fraction with a denominator of 2:

\[
3d = \frac{6d}{2}
\]

Now, substitute this back into the equation:

\[
\frac{6d}{2} + \frac{d}{2} = 105
\]

Combine the fractions:

\[
\frac{6d + d}{2} = 105
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{7d}{2} = 105
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 2:

\[
7d = 210
\]

Now, divide both sides by 7:

\[
d = 30
\]

Thus, the number of players on the defense is \( \boxed{30} \). 

To verify:
- Offense: \( 2d = 2 \times 30 = 60 \)
- Special teams: \( \frac{d}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \)

Now, check the total:

30 + 60 + 15 = 105

### Step 1: Understand the problem
- Farmer Brown has a total of 60 animals, which are either chickens or cows.
- He has twice as many chickens as cows.
- We need to calculate the total number of legs, knowing that:
  - Each chicken has 2 legs.
  - Each cow has 4 legs.

### Step 2: Define the variables and set up the equation
- Let \( c \) represent the number of cows.
- Then, the number of chickens is \( 2c \) (since there are twice as many chickens as cows).
- The total number of animals is 60, so:
  \[
  c + 2c = 60

- Simplify the equation:

### Step 1: Understand the weights
- The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
- The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
- The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
- The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
- The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Summarizing the weights:
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds

### Step 2: Calculate the total weight
The container carries one of each animal and weighs 20 pounds itself. So, we add up:
- Weight of the container: 20 pounds
- Weight of the pink frog: 50 pounds
- Weight of the blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Weight of the green toad: 50 pounds
- Weight of the yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Weight of the red bird: 30 pounds

Total weight = 20 + 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30

### Step 1: Understand the problem
- The company purchased equipment worth a total of $400,000.
- 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty and returned to the seller.
- We need to determine the net amount spent on the functioning (non-faulty) pieces.
- The problem doesn't specify the exact number of pieces or their individual values, so we'll assume the pieces are of equal value for simplicity. This means the faulty pieces represent 40% of the total value.

### Step 2: Calculate the value of the faulty pieces
- Total value of equipment: $400,000
- Faulty pieces: 40% of the total number of pieces
- Assuming equal value per piece, the value of the faulty pieces is 40% of the total value:
  \[
  \text{Value of faulty pieces} = 0.40 \times 400,000 = 160,000

### Step 3: Calculate the value of the functioning pieces
- Functioning pieces: 60% of the total number of pieces (since 100% - 40% = 60%)
- Assuming equal value per piece, the value of the functioning pieces is 60% of the total value:
  \[
  \text{Value of functioning pieces} = 0.60 \times 400,000 = 240,000
  \]

### Step 4: Determine the net amount spent
- The company initially spent $400,000.
- They returned the faulty pieces, so they should receive a refund for the value of those pieces ($160,000).
- The net amount spent on the functioning pieces is the initial total minus the refund:
  \[
  \text{Net amount spent} = 400,000 - 160,000 = 240,000
  \]

### Final Answer
The total amount of money spent on the functioning pieces of equipment, after returning the faulty ones and receiving a refund, is **$240,000**.",0.0005668,12.628500938415527,0,0,grok-3-mini,,,1

gsm8k,gsm8k-384,Random,1,"To solve the problem of how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, let's reason through it step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the problem
- Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land.
- This means he had 2/5 of his land left (since 1 - 3/5 = 2/5).
- We know the amount left is 12.8 hectares.
- Let \( x \) represent the total amount of land he had at first (in hectares).

### Step 2: Set up the equation
- The amount left is 2/5 of the total land, so:
  \[
  \frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
  \]

### Step 3: Solve for \( x \)
- Multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 2/5, which is 5/2:
  \[
  x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
  \]
- First, multiply 12.8 by 5:
  \[
  12.8 \times 5 = 64
  \]
- Then, divide by 2:
  \[
  64 \div 2 = 32
  \]
- So, \( x = 32 \).

### Step 4: Verify the solution
- If he had 32 hectares initially, he sold 3/5 of it:
  \[
  \frac{3}{5} \times 32 = \frac{3 \times 32}{5} = \frac{96}{5} = 19.2 \text{ hectares sold}
  \]
- The amount left would be:
  \[
  32 - 19.2 = 12.8 \text{ hectares}
  \]
- This matches the problem, so our solution is correct.

Mr. Ruther had **32 hectares** of land at first.",0.0004171,9.823860168457031,0,0,grok-3-mini,,,1

gsm8k,gsm8k-405,Random,1,"To determine how much Tyson will spend on meat and cheese for the muffaletta sandwiches, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of sandwiches needed**: Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we can find the number of sandwiches needed for 20 people by dividing the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves.

   \[
   \text{Number of sandwiches} = \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people/sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed**: Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. Therefore, for 5 sandwiches, Tyson will need:

   - Meat: 
   \[
   5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound/sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat}
   \]
   - Cheese: 
   \[
   5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound/sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of cheese}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the meat and cheese**:
   - The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound, so for 5 pounds:
   \[
   \text{Cost of meat} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 7.00 \text{ dollars/pound} = 35.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   - The cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound, so for 5 pounds:
   \[
   \text{Cost of cheese} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 3.00 \text{ dollars/pound} = 15.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost**:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of meat} + \text{Cost of cheese} = 35.00 \text{ dollars} + 15.00 \text{ dollars} = 50.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, Tyson would spend a total of **$50.00** on meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people.",0.00030705,6.33739447593689,0,0,gpt-4o-mini,,,0

### Step 1: Understand the initial situation
- Allan has a total of 40 cannolis in his house.
- There is twice as much corn as cannolis, so the initial amount of corn is \(2 \times 40 = 80\).

Initial amounts:
- Cannolis: 40
- Corns: 80

### Step 2: Account for what Allan bought
- Allan bought 60 more cannolis, which means he bought 60 cannolis.
- He also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought. Since he bought 60 cannolis, the number of corns he bought is \(60 - 40 = 20\).

Amounts after buying:
- New cannolis: Initial cannolis + Bought cannolis = \(40 + 60 = 100\)
- New corns: Initial corns + Bought corns = \(80 + 20 = 100\)

### Step 3: Calculate the combined total
- Total corns and cannolis: \(100 \text{ (corns)} + 100 \text{ (cannolis)} = 200\)

Therefore, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in his house is **200**.",0.0007516,22.76049017906189,0,0,grok-3-mini,,,1

Let:
- \( c \) be the number of camels.
- \( d \) be the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of heads (which is the total number of animals) is 180:
   \[
   c + d = 180
   \]

2. The total number of bumps (humps) is 304. Since camels have 2 humps each and dromedaries have 1 hump each, we can express this as:
   \[
   2c + d = 304
   \]

Now we have the following system of equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)  (Equation 1)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \)  (Equation 2)

We can solve this system step by step.

**Step 1: Solve Equation 1 for \( d \)**:
\[
d = 180 - c
\]

**Step 2: Substitute \( d \) in Equation 2**:
Substituting \( d \) from Equation 1 into Equation 2:
\[
2c + (180 - c) = 304
\]

**Step 3: Simplify the equation**:
\[
2c + 180 - c = 304
\]
\[
c + 180 = 304
\]

**Step 4: Solve for \( c \)**:
\[
c = 304 - 180
\]
\[
c = 124
\]

**Step 5: Substitute \( c \) back to find \( d \)**:
Now substitute \( c \) back into Equation 1 to find \( d \):
\[
d = 180 - 124
\]
\[
d = 56

### Step 1: Calculate the subtotal before the discount
- Cost of the set of pots and pans: $120.00
- Cost of the set of mixing bowls: $20.00
- Cost of 5 utensils at $5.00 each: 5 × $5.00 = $25.00

gsm8k,gsm8k-439,Random,1,"Let me reason through this step by step to determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne.

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- Wayne's drive time to the theater is 4 minutes.
- Bernadette's drive time is four times as long as Wayne's, so:
  - Bernadette's drive time = 4 × 4 minutes = 16 minutes.
- Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.

### Step 2: Define the variables
- Let \( t_w \) be the time Wayne leaves (in minutes from some reference point).
- Let \( t_b \) be the time Bernadette leaves (in minutes from the same reference point).
- Wayne's arrival time = \( t_w + 4 \) minutes.
- Bernadette's arrival time = \( t_b + 16 \) minutes.

### Step 3: Set up the condition
- Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so:
  - Bernadette's arrival time = Wayne's arrival time - 5 minutes.
  - Mathematically: \( t_b + 16 = (t_w + 4) - 5 \).

### Step 4: Solve the equation
- Simplify the right side: \( (t_w + 4) - 5 = t_w - 1 \).
- So, the equation is: \( t_b + 16 = t_w - 1 \).
- Rearrange to solve for \( t_w - t_b \) (the difference in their leaving times):
  - Add 1 to both sides: \( t_b + 17 = t_w \).
  - Therefore, \( t_w - t_b = 17 \).

This means Bernadette needs to leave 17 minutes before Wayne.

### Step 5: Verify the solution
- If Bernadette leaves 17 minutes before Wayne:
  - Suppose Wayne leaves at time \( T \).
  - Bernadette leaves at \( T - 17 \).
  - Bernadette arrives at: \( (T - 17) + 16 = T - 1 \).
  - Wayne arrives at: \( T + 4 \).
  - The difference in arrival times: Wayne's arrival - Bernadette's arrival = \( (T + 4) - (T - 1) = 5 \) minutes.
- This confirms Bernadette arrives exactly 5 minutes before Wayne.

Bernadette should leave **17 minutes earlier than Wayne**.",0.00058,12.626501321792604,0,0,grok-3-mini,,,1

gsm8k,gsm8k-452,Random,1,"To find the car's average speed for the entire trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken. Average speed is defined as:

\[
\text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the distance for each part of the trip.
- **First part:** The car drives at 60 mph for 2 hours.  
  Distance = Speed × Time = \( 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \).
  
- **Second part:** The car drives at 30 mph for 1 hour.  
  Distance = Speed × Time = \( 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles} \).

### Step 2: Calculate the total distance traveled.
Total distance = Distance (first part) + Distance (second part) = \( 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles} \).

### Step 3: Calculate the total time taken.
Total time = Time (first part) + Time (second part) = \( 2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours} \).

### Step 4: Calculate the average speed.
Average speed = \( \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph} \).

### Explanation:
- The average speed is not simply the average of the two speeds (which would be \( \frac{60 + 30}{2} = 45 \, \text{mph} \)) because the car spends different amounts of time at each speed. Since it traveled longer at the higher speed (2 hours at 60 mph vs. 1 hour at 30 mph), the average speed is weighted toward the higher speed, resulting in 50 mph.
- This approach ensures the calculation is based on the total distance and total time, which is the correct method for average speed.

gsm8k,gsm8k-459,Random,1,"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the total weight of each type of feed
- **Sugar cubes**: The farmer buys 2 boxes, each weighing 1 pound.  
  Total weight = 2 × 1 = 2 pounds.

- **Carrots**: The farmer buys 4 bags, each weighing 12 pounds.  
  Total weight = 4 × 12 = 48 pounds.

- **Hay**: The farmer buys 42 bales, each weighing 75 pounds.  
  Total weight = 42 × 75 = 3,150 pounds.

- **Oats**: The farmer buys 20 sacks, each weighing 65 pounds.  
  Total weight = 20 × 65 = 1,300 pounds.

### Step 2: Calculate the total weight of all the feed
Add up the weights from each category:  
Total weight = 2 (sugar) + 48 (carrots) + 3,150 (hay) + 1,300 (oats) = 4,500 pounds.

### Step 3: Determine the number of trips needed
The farm truck can carry 2,250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips, divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:  
4,500 ÷ 2,250 = 2 trips exactly.

Since the total weight divides evenly, the farmer needs exactly 2 trips to transport all the feed.

### Step 1: Understand the purchase
- Heather is buying 2 packs of razors.
- Each pack contains 4 razors, so 2 packs contain:  
  \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) razors.

### Step 2: Apply the sale (Buy One Get One Free)
- The sale means that for every pack she buys, she gets another one free.
- For 2 packs, she pays for 1 pack and gets the second pack free.
- The original price per pack is $4.00.
- Cost for 2 packs with the sale:  
  \( 1 \times 4.00 = 4.00 \) dollars (she only pays for one pack).

### Step 3: Apply the coupon
- She has a $2.00 coupon, which is applied to the total cost.
- Total cost before coupon: $4.00
- Total cost after coupon:  
  \( 4.00 - 2.00 = 2.00 \) dollars.

### Step 4: Calculate the cost per razor
- Total cost after discounts: $2.00
- Total razors: 8
- Cost per razor:  
  \( 2.00 \div 8 = 0.25 \) dollars per razor.

### Step 5: Convert to cents
- $0.25 is equivalent to 25 cents.

Each individual razor will cost **25 cents** after the discounts.",0.000535,12.670451641082764,0,0,grok-3-mini,,,1
gsm8k,gsm8k-494,Random,1,"To find the height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the total height contributed by each layer of cheerleaders.

1. **Bottom Layer (4 girls)**: The height of each of the 9 cheerleaders is 64 inches, and the height of the 10th cheerleader is 60 inches. Since there are 4 girls on the bottom, we will use the height of the taller cheerleaders (64 inches):
   - Height of bottom layer = 4 girls × 64 inches = 256 inches.

2. **Second Layer (3 girls)**: Again, we will use the height of the taller cheerleaders (64 inches):
   - Height of second layer = 3 girls × 64 inches = 192 inches.

3. **Third Layer (2 girls)**: We will continue using the height of the taller cheerleaders (64 inches):
   - Height of third layer = 2 girls × 64 inches = 128 inches.

4. **Top Layer (1 girl)**: The shortest cheerleader (60 inches) is at the top:
   - Height of top layer = 60 inches.

Now, we can add the heights of all the layers together:

\[
\text{Total height} = 256 \text{ inches} + 192 \text{ inches} + 128 \text{ inches} + 60 \text{ inches}

- For the second venue, the cost is $25 per guest, which includes food, so the cost is \( 25g \).

Set the costs equal to find \( g \):
\[
200 + 5g = 25g

gsm8k,gsm8k-510,Random,1,"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to reach his goal of losing 30 lbs by July 19th, we'll break this down step by step. A calorie deficit is the net difference between the calories he consumes and the calories he burns each day.

### Step 1: Calculate the total time available
- Today is December 31st, 2023 (assuming the current year for context).
- Andy's birthday is July 19th, 2024.
- The period from January 1, 2024, to July 19, 2024, includes:
  - January: 31 days
  - February: 29 days (2024 is a leap year)
  - March: 31 days
  - April: 30 days
  - May: 31 days
  - June: 30 days
  - July: 19 days
- Total days: 31 + 29 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 201 days.

Since his resolution starts today (December 31st, 2023), we'll consider the full period from January 1, 2024, to July 19, 2024, as 201 days for the weight loss plan. (If he begins activities today, it adds one extra day, but for simplicity and standard practice, we'll use the 201 days from the new year.)

### Step 2: Calculate the total calories to burn
- Andy wants to lose 30 lbs.
- It takes 3500 calories to lose 1 lb.
- Total calories needed: 30 lbs × 3500 calories/lb = 105,000 calories.

### Step 3: Calculate the daily calorie deficit
- To lose 105,000 calories over 201 days, divide the total calories by the number of days:
  - Daily calorie deficit = 105,000 calories ÷ 201 days ≈ 522.89 calories per day.

### Step 4: Final Answer
Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of approximately **523 calories** to reach his goal. This means he should aim to burn about 523 more calories than he consumes each day on average.

**Important Notes:**
- This is a rough estimate based on the standard 3500 calories per pound rule, which can vary by individual factors like metabolism, age, gender, activity level, and muscle mass.
- A safe and sustainable weight loss rate is 1-2 lbs per week, so consult a doctor or nutritionist before starting any diet or exercise plan.
- To achieve this deficit, Andy could track his daily intake and expenditure using apps like MyFitnessPal or a fitness tracker, ensuring he maintains a balanced diet and incorporates exercise.",0.001052,21.704545736312863,0,0,grok-3-mini,,,0

""Kilowatts per hour"" isn't a standard unit for energy consumption; it's likely meant to be ""kilowatt-hours (kWh)"" per day, which is the common way to measure electricity usage. I'll proceed with that assumption for the calculations, as it aligns with typical electric billing practices.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the current daily consumption:**
   - Ada's daily electric consumption is 12 kWh.

2. **Identify the additional consumption:**
   - The new device adds 2 kWh per day.

3. **Calculate the total daily consumption after adding the device:**
   - New daily consumption = 12 kWh + 2 kWh = 14 kWh.

4. **Determine the cost per kWh:**
   - The cost is $1.50 per kWh.

5. **Calculate the daily cost before and after:**
   - Daily cost before = 12 kWh × $1.50/kWh = $18.00.
   - Daily cost after = 14 kWh × $1.50/kWh = $21.00.

6. **Calculate the weekly cost (assuming 7 days in a week):**
   - Weekly cost before = $18.00 × 7 = $126.00.
   - Weekly cost after = $21.00 × 7 = $147.00.

7. **Find the difference in weekly costs:**
   - Difference = Weekly cost after - Weekly cost before = $147.00 - $126.00 = $21.00.

### Final Answer:
The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device is **$21.00**. This represents the additional cost due to the extra 2 kWh per day over a week.",0.0004858,16.140565633773804,0,0,grok-3-mini,,,0
gsm8k,gsm8k-527,Random,1,"To answer your query, let's break this down step by step. This is a reasoning problem involving work rates, so I'll calculate the time required based on the given information.

### Step 1: Determine the work rate of one person
- We know that one person can paint half a house in 5 days.
- Therefore, the time for one person to paint a whole house is:  
  \( 5 \, \text{days} \times 2 = 10 \, \text{days} \).
- Work rate of one person:  
  \( \frac{1 \, \text{house}}{10 \, \text{days}} = 0.1 \, \text{houses per day} \).

### Step 2: Calculate the combined work rate of 5 people
- If one person paints 0.1 houses per day, then 5 people together paint:  
  \( 5 \times 0.1 \, \text{houses per day} = 0.5 \, \text{houses per day} \).

### Step 3: Find the time for 5 people to paint one whole house
- At a combined rate of 0.5 houses per day, the time to paint 1 house is:  
  \( \frac{1 \, \text{house}}{0.5 \, \text{houses per day}} = 2 \, \text{days} \).

### Step 4: Convert the time to hours
- Assuming a standard day has 24 hours (as no specific working hours are mentioned), the total time is:  
  \( 2 \, \text{days} \times 24 \, \text{hours per day} = 48 \, \text{hours} \).

### Final Answer
It would take 5 people **48 hours** to paint a whole house.  

This assumes continuous work and no other factors like breaks or inefficiencies. If you have additional details (e.g., working hours per day), I can refine this further!",0.0004858,13.655191421508787,0,0,grok-3-mini,,,1

   Plugging in the known values:
   \[

4. **Simplifying the Equation**: Combine the known costs:

- Area = Length × Width = 18 × 12 = 216 square feet

### Step 2: Calculate the costs for each component
- **Cost of the new carpet**: $12 per square foot  
  Total = 12 × 216 = $2,592

- **Cost of padding**: $2 per square foot  
  Total = 2 × 216 = $432

- **Cost to remove the old carpet**: $4 per square foot  
  Total = 4 × 216 = $864

- **Cost to install the new carpet**: $34 per square foot  
  Total = 34 × 216 = $7,744

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost
- Total cost = Cost of carpet + Cost of padding + Cost of removal + Cost of installation  
- Total cost = $2,592 + $432 + $864 + $7,744 = $11,632

### Final Answer
It will cost Michael **$11,632** to replace the carpet in his bedroom. Note that the installation cost per square foot ($34) seems unusually high, but I've used the figures provided in your query for this calculation.

gsm8k,gsm8k-577,Random,1,"To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day over the week, we first need to calculate the total number of birds he saw during the seven days.

1. **Birds counted each day:**
   - Day 1 and Day 2: 50 birds
   - Day 3: 0 birds
   - Day 4 and Day 5: 120 birds
   - Day 6: 20 birds
   - Day 7: 90 birds

2. **Calculating the total:**
   - For Days 1 and 2, since they total 50 birds, we can assume he saw 25 birds each day (but the exact distribution doesn't affect the total).
   - Day 3: 0 birds
   - For Days 4 and 5, since they total 120 birds, we can assume he saw 60 birds each day (again, the exact distribution doesn't affect the total).
   - Day 6: 20 birds
   - Day 7: 90 birds

Now, let's sum these numbers:
- Total = 50 (Days 1 and 2) + 0 (Day 3) + 120 (Days 4 and 5) + 20 (Day 6) + 90 (Day 7)

Calculating the total:
- Total = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

3. **Calculating the average:**
To find the average number of birds seen per day, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days (7 days).

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total birds}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{280}{7} = 40

Thus, on average, Mack saw **40 birds per day**.",0.0002525999999999,12.042372226715088,0,0,gpt-4o-mini,,,1

gsm8k,gsm8k-608,Random,1,"Joe has $50 and wants to buy a shirt for $25 and shorts for $35, with a 30% discount on both items. The problem states that sales tax is included, so I'll assume this means we only need to calculate the discounted prices and not add any additional tax.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Calculate the discounted price of the shirt:**
   - Original price: $25
   - Discount: 30% of $25 = 0.30 × 25 = $7.50
   - Discounted price: $25 - $7.50 = $17.50

2. **Calculate the discounted price of the shorts:**
   - Original price: $35
   - Discount: 30% of $35 = 0.30 × 35 = $10.50
   - Discounted price: $35 - $10.50 = $24.50

3. **Total cost after discount:**
   - Shirt + Shorts = $17.50 + $24.50 = $42.00

4. **Money left after purchase:**
   - Joe starts with $50
   - Amount spent: $42.00
   - Money left: $50 - $42.00 = $8.00

Joe will have **$8.00** left after the purchase.",0.0006923,14.77198600769043,0,0,grok-3-mini,,,1

gsm8k,gsm8k-611,Random,1,"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we can break it down into two parts: the initial funding for the first 5 months and the funding for the additional months.

1. **Initial Funding for the First 5 Months:**
   - The initial funding is $100,000 for the first 5 months.
   - Total cost for the first 5 months = $100,000.

2. **Duration of Research:**
   - John’s research took 10 times longer than initially planned.
   - Therefore, the total duration of the research = 10 months × 5 months = 50 months.

3. **Funding for the Additional Months:**
   - The additional months after the first 5 months = 50 months - 5 months = 45 months.
   - The funding for each of these months increases by 50% compared to the previous month.

   Let's calculate the funding for each of the additional months:
   - The funding for the 6th month = 50% more than the funding for the 5th month.
   - Since the funding for the first 5 months is $100,000, we can assume that the funding for the 5th month is \( \frac{100,000}{5} = 20,000 \).

   Now we can calculate the funding for the subsequent months:
   - 6th month: \( 20,000 \times 1.5 = 30,000 \)
   - 7th month: \( 30,000 \times 1.5 = 45,000 \)
   - 8th month: \( 45,000 \times 1.5 = 67,500 \)
   - 9th month: \( 67,500 \times 1.5 = 101,250 \)
   - 10th month: \( 101,250 \times 1.5 = 151,875 \)
   - 11th month: \( 151,875 \times 1.5 = 227,812.50 \)

   - 16th month: \( 1,153,300.79 \times 1.5 = 1,729,951.19 \)
   - 17th month: \( 1,729,951.19 \times 1.5 = 2,594,926.79 \)

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of street lights.
- Each pole has 4 street lights.
- There are 6 poles at each intersection.
- Therefore, the number of street lights per intersection is:  
  \( 6 \text{ poles/intersection} \times 4 \text{ street lights/pole} = 24 \text{ street lights/intersection} \).
- There are 4 intersections.
- So, the total number of street lights across all intersections is:  
  \( 24 \text{ street lights/intersection} \times 4 \text{ intersections} = 96 \text{ street lights} \).

### Step 2: Account for the non-working street lights.
- Out of the total 96 street lights, 20 are not working.
- Therefore, the number of functioning street lights is:

1. **Calculate the total number of sessions**:
   - John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks.
   - Each week, he went twice.
   - Total sessions = 6 weeks × 2 sessions/week = 12 sessions.

2. **Calculate the total hours**:
   - Each session lasted 2 hours.
   - Total hours = 12 sessions × 2 hours/session = 24 hours.

3. **Calculate the total cost**:
   - The cost per hour is $125.

- The price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of the diamond jewel.
- The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel.

We need to find the total price of all three jewels.

### Step 1: Calculate the price of the gold jewel
The price of the gold jewel is \( \frac{4}{5} \) times the price of the diamond jewel.  
Price of diamond jewel = $2000  
So, price of gold jewel = \( \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 0.8 \times 2000 = 1600 \) dollars.

The price of the silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel.  
Price of gold jewel = $1600

    If the cost per class cannot be more than $10, and the total cost is $60, then:
    Total Cost / Number of Classes Attended <= $10
    $60 / Number of Classes Attended <= $10

    To find the minimum number of classes he needs to attend for the cost to be $10 or less:
    Number of Classes Attended = $60 / $10 = 6 classes

    So, Manny must attend at least 6 classes for his parents to sign him up again.

2.  **Calculate how many classes he can miss:**
    Total classes - Minimum classes to attend = Maximum classes he can miss

gsm8k,gsm8k-639,Random,1,"To find out how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole in cubic feet.

The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is calculated using the formula:

\[
V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}
\]

Given:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

Now, substituting the values into the formula:

\[
V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet}
\]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) to dig the entire hole can be calculated by multiplying the volume by the time per cubic foot:

\[
T = V \times \text{time per cubic foot} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds/cubic foot}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
T = 72 \times 3 = 216 \, \text{seconds}
\]

To convert seconds into minutes, we divide by 60:

\[
T = \frac{216}{60} = 3.6 \, \text{minutes}

Thus, it will take Bob **216 seconds** or **3.6 minutes** to dig the hole.",0.00021855,3.4703028202056885,0,0,gpt-4o-mini,,,0

gsm8k,gsm8k-658,Random,1,"Let me reason through this step by step based on the information provided in your query.

### Step 1: Identify the cooking times
- The time to cook rice is given as 30 minutes.
- Pork takes 20 more minutes than rice, so:
  - Time for pork = Time for rice + 20 minutes = 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.
- Beans take half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. First, calculate the combined time:
  - Combined time of pork and rice = Time for pork + Time for rice = 50 minutes + 30 minutes = 80 minutes.
  - Time for beans = Half of the combined time = 80 minutes ÷ 2 = 40 minutes.

So, the individual cooking times are:
- Rice: 30 minutes
- Pork: 50 minutes
- Beans: 40 minutes

### Step 2: Determine the total time to cook all the food
The query asks for the total time to cook all the food. Assuming the foods are cooked sequentially (one after another), the total time is the sum of the individual cooking times:
- Total time = Time for rice + Time for pork + Time for beans
- Total time = 30 minutes + 50 minutes + 40 minutes = 120 minutes

If the foods could be cooked simultaneously (e.g., in different pots), the total time would be the longest individual cooking time, which is 50 minutes. However, based on the context of the query, it seems more likely that we're calculating the sequential total, as no overlapping is specified.

gsm8k,gsm8k-661,Random,1,"Roger wants to buy a week's worth of coffee and a donut. Let's break this down step by step to calculate the total cost.

### Step 1: Determine the cost of the coffee
- The normal brand costs $5 per pound.
- The more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal price.
  - 20% of $5 = 0.20 × 5 = $1.
  - So, the expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.
- Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day and needs a week's worth, which is 7 days.
- Total coffee needed: 7 pounds.
- Cost of coffee: 7 pounds × $6 per pound = $42.

### Step 2: Add the cost of the donut
- The donut costs $2.

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost
- Total cost = Cost of coffee + Cost of donut = $42 + $2 = $44.

### Step 1: Define the relationships
- Let \( CM \) represent the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has.
- Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so:  
  \( \text{Max's cookies} = CM + 12 \)
- Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so:  
  \( \text{Katarina's cookies} = \text{Max's cookies} - 5 \)
- We're told Katarina has 68 cookies, so:  
  \( 68 = \text{Max's cookies} - 5 \)
- Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so:  
  \( \text{Summer's cookies} = \text{Max's cookies} + 23 \)

### Step 2: Solve for Max's cookies
From the equation for Katarina:  
\( 68 = \text{Max's cookies} - 5 \)  
Add 5 to both sides:  
\( \text{Max's cookies} = 68 + 5 = 73 \)

So, Max has 73 cookies.

### Step 3: Solve for the Cookie Monster's cookies
Using the relationship for Max:  
\( \text{Max's cookies} = CM + 12 \)  
Substitute the value:  
\( 73 = CM + 12 \)  
Subtract 12 from both sides:  
\( CM = 73 - 12 = 61 \)

So, the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies.

### Step 4: Solve for Summer's cookies
Using the relationship for Summer:  
\( \text{Summer's cookies} = \text{Max's cookies} + 23 \)  
Substitute the value:  
\( \text{Summer's cookies} = 73 + 23 = 96 \)

So, Summer has 96 cookies.

### Step 5: Calculate the total cookies
Now we add up the cookies for everyone:  
- Katarina: 68 cookies  
- Max: 73 cookies  
- Cookie Monster: 61 cookies  
- Summer: 96 cookies  

Total = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- Manolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies for a total cost of $3.20.
- Each lollipop costs $0.40.

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the lollipops he bought
- Cost of 5 lollipops = 5 × $0.40 = $2.00.

### Step 3: Determine the cost of the candies
- Total cost for 5 lollipops and 4 candies = $3.20.
- Cost of 4 candies = Total cost - Cost of 5 lollipops = $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20.
- Cost per candy = $1.20 ÷ 4 = $0.30.

### Step 4: Calculate the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies
- Cost of 10 lollipops = 10 × $0.40 = $4.00.
- Cost of 10 candies = 10 × $0.30 = $3.00.

gsm8k,gsm8k-690,Random,1,"To find out how many coins Rong and Neil have after ten years, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of months in ten years**:
   \[
   \text{Total months} = 10 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 120 \text{ months}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total coins saved by Rong**:
   Rong saves 20 coins every month. Therefore, the total coins saved by Rong in ten years is:
   \[
   \text{Total coins by Rong} = 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins}
   \]

3. **Calculate how many coins Neil saves per month**:
   Neil saves \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more than Rong. First, we need to find out how much more that is:
   \[
   \text{More coins} = \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \text{ coins} = 8 \text{ coins}
   \]
   Therefore, Neil saves:
   \[
   \text{Total coins by Neil per month} = 20 \text{ coins} + 8 \text{ coins} = 28 \text{ coins}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total coins saved by Neil**:
   The total coins saved by Neil in ten years is:
   \[
   \text{Total coins by Neil} = 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total coins saved by both Rong and Neil**:
   \[
   \text{Total coins} = \text{Total coins by Rong} + \text{Total coins by Neil} = 2400 \text{ coins} + 3360 \text{ coins} = 5760 \text{ coins}

gsm8k,gsm8k-691,Random,1,"Let me reason through this step by step to determine how much money John leaves with.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the vaccines.
- John’s dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20.
- Total cost for vaccines = 2 × $20 = $40.

### Step 2: Define the total bill and the heartworm check.
- Let T represent the total bill.
- The heartworm check costs 60% of the total bill, so its cost is 0.6T.
- The total bill includes the vaccines ($40) and the heartworm check (0.6T).
- Therefore, the equation for the total bill is: T = $40 + 0.6T.

### Step 3: Solve for T.
- Subtract 0.6T from both sides: T - 0.6T = $40.
- This simplifies to 0.4T = $40.
- Divide both sides by 0.4: T = $40 / 0.4 = $100.
- So, the total bill is $100.

### Step 4: Verify the costs.
- Heartworm check = 60% of $100 = 0.6 × $100 = $60.
- Vaccines = $40.
- Total = $60 + $40 = $100 (which matches).

### Step 5: Calculate how much John leaves with.
- John brought $125.
- He pays the total bill of $100.
- Amount left = $125 - $100 = $25.

gsm8k,gsm8k-707,Random,1,"Let me reason through this step by step to determine what percent of the Colorado River's total water is used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes.

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- Colorado City uses 40% of the total water from the Colorado River.
- Of the water the city uses (which is 40% of the total), 80% is for industrial purposes.
- This means the remaining portion of the city's water usage is for non-industrial purposes.

### Step 2: Calculate the industrial usage
- The city's total usage is 40% of the river's total water.
- Industrial usage is 80% of the city's 40%.
- So, industrial usage = 80% × 40% = 0.80 × 40 = 32% of the river's total water.

### Step 3: Calculate the non-industrial usage
- The city's total usage is 40%, and industrial usage is 32%.
- Therefore, non-industrial usage = Total city usage - Industrial usage = 40% - 32% = 8% of the river's total water.

### Step 4: Verify the calculation
- Alternatively, non-industrial usage is the remaining 20% of the city's water (since 100% - 80% = 20%).
- 20% of 40% = 0.20 × 40% = 8% of the river's total water.
- This confirms our result.

First, I need to find the length of Bobby's shoes in inches. The problem gives me information about Topher's shoe length and how it compares to Bobby's.

Topher's shoe length is given as 8 feet and 4 inches. I need to convert that to inches because the answer needs to be in inches, and Bobby's shoe length will be in inches too.

I know that 1 foot = 12 inches. So, 8 feet is 8 * 12 = 96 inches. Then, adding the 4 inches, that's 96 + 4 = 100 inches. So, Topher's shoe is 100 inches long.

Now, the relationship between Topher's shoe and Bobby's shoe is given: ""The length of one of Topher’s shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby’s shoes.""

Let \( B \) be the length of Bobby's shoe in inches.

Then, according to the problem, Topher's shoe length is 10 inches longer than 9 times Bobby's. So:

Topher's length = 9 * Bobby's length + 10 inches.

In equation form:

\[ T = 9B + 10 \]

I know T is 100 inches, as I calculated.

So,

\[ 100 = 9B + 10 \]

Now, I need to solve for B.

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9B \]

\[ 90 = 9B \]

Then, divide both sides by 9:

\[ B = \frac{90}{9} \]

\[ B = 10 \]

So, Bobby's shoe is 10 inches long.

I should double-check.

If Bobby's shoe is 10 inches, then 9 times that is 90 inches. Plus 10 inches is 100 inches, which matches Topher's shoe length. Perfect.

The problem mentioned Topher is the green giant, so his shoes are huge, and Bobby's are small, 10 inches makes sense for a regular shoe, I think. 10 inches is about 25.4 cm, which is plausible for a shoe size.

Also, the conversion: 8 feet is 96 inches, plus 4 is 100, yes.

And the equation is straightforward.

So, Bobby's shoe length is 10 inches.
</think>Topher's shoe length is given as 8 feet and 4 inches. Convert this to inches:  
- 8 feet = 8 × 12 = 96 inches  
- Add 4 inches: 96 + 4 = 100 inches  

Let \( B \) be the length of Bobby's shoe in inches. According to the problem, Topher's shoe length is 10 inches longer than 9 times Bobby's shoe length:  
\[ 100 = 9B + 10 \]  

Solve for \( B \):  
\[ 100 - 10 = 9B \]  
\[ 90 = 9B \]  
\[ B = \frac{90}{9} \]  
\[ B = 10 \]  

Thus, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.  

Verification:  
- 9 times Bobby's shoe length: 9 × 10 = 90 inches  
- Add 10 inches: 90 + 10 = 100 inches, which matches Topher's shoe length.",0.00183809,58.25107884407044,0,0,deepseek-r1,,,0

  - Math book: 2 pounds
  - Science book: 2 pounds
- French book: 4 pounds
- English book: 3 pounds
- History book: Twice the weight of the English book, so 2 × 3 = 6 pounds

### Step 2: List all the books and their weights
- Math book: 2 pounds
- Science book: 2 pounds
- French book: 4 pounds
- English book: 3 pounds
- History book: 6 pounds

### Step 3: Calculate the total weight

- There are 33 people on the council, and we assume all members voted (either in favor or against).
- Let \( A \) represent the number of votes against the regulation.
- According to the problem, the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, so that's \( 2A \).

3. One third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls, so:

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250:
   \[
   x + y + z = 250
   \]

2. The first house needs half of what the second house needs:
   \[
   x = \frac{1}{2}y
   \]

3. The third house needs double what the first house needs:
   \[
   z = 2x
   \]

Now, we can substitute \( x \) and \( z \) in terms of \( y \) into the total equation.

From the second equation, we can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
\[
y = 2x
\]

Now substituting \( y \) into the total equation:
\[
x + 2x + 2x = 250
\]
\[

\[
x = 50

\[
z = 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100

gsm8k,gsm8k-780,Random,1,"To determine the difference between Ava's and Emma's scores, let's break this down step by step based on the points system and the given information.

### Step 1: Understand the points system
- 10 points for each enemy jumped on
- 5 points for each berry collected
- 30 points for each second left on the timer

### Step 2: Define the variables
Let:
- \( E_e \) = Number of enemies Emma jumps on
- \( B_e \) = Number of berries Emma collects
- \( S_e \) = Seconds left on the timer for Emma

For Ava:
- She jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so \( E_a = E_e + 8 \)
- She collects 3 more berries than Emma, so \( B_a = B_e + 3 \)
- She finishes 4 seconds slower, so she has 4 fewer seconds left on the timer, meaning \( S_a = S_e - 4 \)

### Step 3: Calculate Emma's score
Emma's total score is:
\[
\text{Score}_e = (10 \times E_e) + (5 \times B_e) + (30 \times S_e)
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Ava's score
Ava's total score is:
\[
\text{Score}_a = (10 \times E_a) + (5 \times B_a) + (30 \times S_a)
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
\text{Score}_a = (10 \times (E_e + 8)) + (5 \times (B_e + 3)) + (30 \times (S_e - 4))
\]
Expand the expression:
\[
\text{Score}_a = (10 \times E_e + 80) + (5 \times B_e + 15) + (30 \times S_e - 120)
\]
\[
\text{Score}_a = (10 \times E_e + 5 \times B_e + 30 \times S_e) + 80 + 15 - 120
\]
\[
\text{Score}_a = \text{Score}_e + 95 - 120
\]
\[
\text{Score}_a = \text{Score}_e - 25
\]

### Step 5: Determine the difference
The difference between their scores (Ava's score minus Emma's score) is:
\[
\text{Score}_a - \text{Score}_e = -25
\]
This means Ava's score is 25 points less than Emma's score. In absolute terms, the difference between their two scores is 25 points, with Emma scoring higher.

### Final Answer
The difference between Ava's and Emma's scores is 25 points, with Emma having the higher score.",0.0008653,20.715585470199585,0,0,grok-3-mini,,,1

1. **Calculate the total number of glass chips:**
   - Each bag contains 72 chips.
   - Milo has 2 bags.
   \[
   \text{Total chips} = 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips}

2. **Determine how many square inches of mosaic can be made with the total chips:**
   - It takes 12 chips to cover 1 square inch.
   \[
   \text{Square inches} = \frac{\text{Total chips}}{\text{Chips per square inch}} = \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches}

Let:
*   `S` = amount of salt (in ounces)
*   `O` = amount of oil (in ounces)
*   `F` = amount of fragrance (in ounces)
*   `C` = amount of citrus zest (in ounces)
*   `G` = amount of sugar (in ounces)

We know the total volume of the scrub is 10 ounces:
`S + O + F + C + G = 10` (Equation 1)

Now let's write down the relationships given:
1.  ""She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance""
    `C = F` (Equation 2)
2.  ""and the same amount of salt as sugar""
    `S = G` (Equation 3)
3.  ""She uses twice as much oil as salt""
    `O = 2S` (Equation 4)
4.  ""and twice as much salt as zest""
    `S = 2C` (Equation 5)

Our goal is to find the amount of oil (`O`). Let's express all ingredients in terms of a single variable, for instance, `S` (since `O` is directly related to `S`).

From Equation 5: `S = 2C`
We can express `C` in terms of `S`: `C = S / 2`

From Equation 2: `F = C`
So, `F = S / 2`

From Equation 3: `G = S`

From Equation 4: `O = 2S`

Now substitute all these expressions (`C`, `F`, `G`, `O`) into Equation 1, replacing them with their equivalents in terms of `S`:
`S + (2S) + (S/2) + (S/2) + (S) = 10`

Combine the terms with `S`:
`S + 2S + 0.5S + 0.5S + S = 10`
`(1 + 2 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 1)S = 10`
`5S = 10`

Now solve for `S`:
`S = 10 / 5`
`S = 2` ounces

The question asks for the amount of oil (`O`). From Equation 4:
`O = 2S`
`O = 2 * 2`
`O = 4` ounces

Let's verify all amounts:
*   Salt (S): 2 ounces
*   Sugar (G): 2 ounces (same as salt)
*   Citrus zest (C): 2 / 2 = 1 ounce (half of salt)
*   Fragrance (F): 1 ounce (same as zest)
*   Oil (O): 2 * 2 = 4 ounces (twice as much as salt)

Total: 2 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10 ounces. This matches the total volume.

Let:
*   B = number of cards Becca has
*   S = number of cards Smendrick has
*   P = number of cards PJ has

From the problem statement, we have the following information:

1.  **Total cards:** B + S + P = 341
2.  **Becca vs. Smendrick:** B = S + 12
3.  **Smendrick vs. PJ:** S = 3P

Our goal is to find B (how many cards Becca has).

Let's express everything in terms of one variable, PJ's cards (P), because Smendrick's cards are defined by PJ's, and Becca's cards are defined by Smendrick's.

*   From (3), we know **S = 3P**.
*   Now substitute this into (2) to find B in terms of P:
    B = (3P) + 12
    **B = 3P + 12**

Now we have expressions for B and S all in terms of P. Let's substitute these into the total cards equation (1):

(3P + 12) + (3P) + P = 341

Combine the terms with P:
(3P + 3P + P) + 12 = 341
7P + 12 = 341

Now, solve for P:
7P = 341 - 12
7P = 329

P = 329 / 7
**P = 47**

So, PJ has 47 cards.

Next, find out how many cards Smendrick has using S = 3P:
S = 3 * 47

So, Smendrick has 141 cards.

Finally, find out how many cards Becca has using B = S + 12:
B = 141 + 12

So, Becca has 153 cards.

Let me break this down step by step to calculate the amount for the fourth week.

### Step 1: Identify the production for each week
- **Week 1:** Boris produces 8,000 bars.
- **Week 2:** He produces half as much as Week 1, so:  
  \( 8,000 \div 2 = 4,000 \) bars.
- **Week 3:** He produces three times as much as Week 1, so:  
  \( 8,000 \times 3 = 24,000 \) bars.
- **Week 4:** This is what we're solving for. Let's call it \( X \) bars.

### Step 2: Total production for the month
Boris produces 50,000 bars in a month, which we assume covers the four weeks. So, the total production is:  
\[
\text{Week 1} + \text{Week 2} + \text{Week 3} + \text{Week 4} = 50,000
\]
Substitute the known values:  
\[
8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 + X = 50,000
\]

### Step 3: Perform the calculation
First, add up the production for the first three weeks:  
\[
8,000 + 4,000 = 12,000  
\]
\[
12,000 + 24,000 = 36,000
\]
Now, solve for \( X \):  
\[

gsm8k,gsm8k-831,Random,1,"To calculate the total cost for Angela's installation, we need to break down the costs based on the items she has and the firm's pricing structure.

1. **Base Installation Cost**: The base cost for installation is $129.00, which includes:
   - 4 mirrors
   - 2 shelves
   - 1 chandelier
   - 10 pictures

2. **Items Angela has**:
   - Mirrors: 6
   - Shelves: 0 (she needs to install 2 shelves, but she has none)
   - Chandeliers: 2
   - Pictures: 20

3. **Calculating Additional Items**:
   - **Mirrors**: Angela has 6 mirrors, but the base installation includes 4. Therefore, she has 2 additional mirrors.
   - **Shelves**: She needs to install 2 shelves, which are not included in the base installation.
   - **Chandeliers**: Angela has 2 chandeliers, but the base installation includes 1. Therefore, she has 1 additional chandelier.
   - **Pictures**: Angela has 20 pictures, but the base installation includes 10. Therefore, she has 10 additional pictures.

4. **Total Additional Items**:
   - Additional mirrors: 2
   - Additional shelves: 2
   - Additional chandeliers: 1
   - Additional pictures: 10

   Total additional items = 2 (mirrors) + 2 (shelves) + 1 (chandelier) + 10 (pictures) = 15 additional items.

5. **Cost for Additional Items**:
   The cost for additional items is $15.00 per item. Therefore, for 15 additional items:
   \[
   \text{Cost for additional items} = 15 \times 15 = 225
   \]

6. **Total Cost**:
   Now, we add the base installation cost to the cost of additional items:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Base Cost} + \text{Cost for Additional Items} = 129 + 225 = 354
   \]

Thus, the total cost for Angela's installation will be **$354.00**.",0.0003001499999999,4.571073770523071,0,0,gpt-4o-mini,,,0

1. **Pompei's lifting ability**: 
   - Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.

2. **Saskay's lifting ability**: 
   - Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
   - Therefore, Saskay can lift: 
     \[

3. **Kagiyami's lifting ability**: 
   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.

2.  **Turtles' Speed Relative to Kangaroos:**
    Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo.

Let:
*   **M** = My age
*   **B** = Brother's age
*   **S** = Sister's age
*   **Mo** = Mom's age

From the problem statement, we can form the following equations:

1.  ""I am three years younger than my brother""
    M = B - 3
    This means B = M + 3

2.  ""I am 2 years older than my sister""
    M = S + 2
    This means S = M - 2

3.  ""My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age""
    Mo = 3B - 1

4.  ""When you add all our ages, you get 87""
    M + B + S + Mo = 87

Now, let's substitute the expressions for B, S, and Mo (in terms of M) into the fourth equation:

*   Substitute B = (M + 3) into the equation for Mo:
    Mo = 3(M + 3) - 1
    Mo = 3M + 9 - 1
    Mo = 3M + 8

*   Now substitute B = (M + 3), S = (M - 2), and Mo = (3M + 8) into the sum equation:
    M + (M + 3) + (M - 2) + (3M + 8) = 87

Combine the M terms:
(M + M + M + 3M) = 6M

Combine the constant terms:
(3 - 2 + 8) = 9

So the equation becomes:
6M + 9 = 87

Now, solve for M:
6M = 87 - 9
6M = 78
M = 78 / 6
**M = 13**

So, you are 13 years old.

Let's check the other ages to ensure everything adds up:

Total ages: 13 + 16 + 11 + 47 = 87. This matches the problem statement.

1. **Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed**:
   - There are 27 students, and each student needs 2 glue sticks.
   - Total glue sticks needed = Number of students × Glue sticks per student
   \[
   \text{Total glue sticks needed} = 27 \times 2 = 54

2. **Determine how many glue sticks are in each pack**:
   - Each pack contains 8 glue sticks.

   - To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack.
   \[
   \text{Number of packs needed} = \frac{\text{Total glue sticks needed}}{\text{Glue sticks per pack}} = \frac{54}{8}

gsm8k,gsm8k-857,Random,1,"Let me reason through this step by step to calculate the total amount of water passing through the river at that point after the described changes.

### Step 1: Understand the initial amount
- On Day 1, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

### Step 2: Calculate the amount on Day 2
- After a day of heavy rain, the amount doubles from Day 1.
- So, Day 2 amount = 4000 gallons × 2 = 8000 gallons.

### Step 3: Calculate the amount on Day 3
- On Day 3, the volume increases by 6000 gallons from the Day 2 amount.
- So, Day 3 amount = 8000 gallons + 6000 gallons = 14000 gallons.

### Step 4: Determine the total amount
- The query asks for the total amount of water passing through the river at that point, which refers to the final amount after all changes (on Day 3).
- Therefore, the total amount on Day 3 is 14000 gallons.

We'll assume that the initial 10 people are infected at the start (Day 0), and each day, every person who is infected at the beginning of that day infects 6 new people. The newly infected people do not start infecting others until the next day.

- **Day 0:** 10 people are infected.
- **Day 1:** Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 new people.  
  New infections: 10 × 6 = 60  
  Total infected at the end of Day 1: 10 + 60 = 70
- **Day 2:** Each of the 70 infected people (from the end of Day 1) infects 6 new people.  
  New infections: 70 × 6 = 420  
  Total infected at the end of Day 2: 70 + 420 = 490
- **Day 3:** Each of the 490 infected people (from the end of Day 2) infects 6 new people.  
  New infections: 490 × 6 = 2,940  
  Total infected at the end of Day 3: 490 + 2,940 = 3,430

### Step 1: Identify the number of each color of cars
- **Red cars**: You mentioned there are 12 red cars.
- **Green cars**: These are 2 fewer than the red cars, so:
  - Green cars = Red cars - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10.
- **Blue cars**: These are 3 times the number of green cars, so:
  - Blue cars = 3 × Green cars = 3 × 10 = 30.
- **Yellow cars**: Let's call this Y (we'll solve for it next).
- **Total cars**: The rink has 75 cars in total, which includes red, green, blue, and yellow cars.

### Step 2: Set up the equation
The total number of cars is the sum of all colors:
- Red cars + Green cars + Blue cars + Yellow cars = 75
- 12 + 10 + 30 + Y = 75

### Step 3: Solve for Y
- First, add up the known numbers: 12 + 10 + 30 = 52

- Y = 75 - 52 = 23

From the problem:
- \(S + A + F = 85\)
- \(S = A + 25\)
- \(A = F - 12\)

Substitute \(A = F - 12\) into \(S = A + 25\):
\[
S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13
\]

Now substitute \(S = F + 13\) and \(A = F - 12\) into the first equation:
\[

Simplify:
\[
F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85

- Joe paid Tasha $6
- Week 1: Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times as many times as Joe's
- Week 2: Tasha mowed Alba's lawn 5 times as many times as Joe's

**Step 1: Determine how many times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn**

Since Joe paid $6 total, I need to figure out how many times she mowed Joe's lawn. The problem states she mowed for Joe, and this serves as the baseline for the other lawns.

Let's assume Joe's lawn was mowed once, and the $6 represents payment for one mowing.

**Step 2: Calculate earnings from each person**

- Joe's lawn: $6 (for 1 mowing)
- Kamala's lawn: 3 times as many as Joe's = 3 × 1 = 3 mowings

- Cups are divided into 3 rows
- Each row has equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea
- Remaining cups are used for 15 cups of cinnamon tea

**Step 1: Find how many cups are used for chamomile and mint tea**

Total cups - Cinnamon tea cups = Chamomile and mint tea cups
27 - 15 = 12 cups

**Step 2: Determine how many cups are in each row**

Since the 12 cups of chamomile and mint tea are divided into 3 rows:

**Setting up equations from the given information:**

1. ""The combined age of Peter, Paul and Jean is 100 years old""
   - Pe + P + J = 100

2. ""Paul is 10 years older than John""
   - P = J + 10

3. ""Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age""
   - Pe = P + J

**Solving the system:**

From equation 3:
- Pe = P + J

Substitute this into equation 1:
- (P + J) + P + J = 100
- 2P + 2J = 100
- P + J = 50

Therefore:

     - Total sales from New York Times = Price per copy × Number of copies sold
     \[
     \text{Total sales from New York Times} = 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ dollars}
     \]

   - For the Wall Street Journal:
     - Price per copy = $15
     - Number of copies sold = 10
     - Total sales from Wall Street Journal = Price per copy × Number of copies sold
     \[

     \]

2. **Calculate the commission for each newspaper:**
   - For the New York Times:
     - Commission rate = 10%
     - Commission from New York Times = Total sales × Commission rate
     \[
     \text{Commission from New York Times} = 30 \times 0.10 = 3 \text{ dollars}

gsm8k,gsm8k-950,Random,1,"Let B be the points Bahati scored, A be the points Azibo scored, and D be the points Dinar scored.

We are given the following information:
1.  The total points scored by the team is 45:
    B + A + D = 45

2.  Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo:
    B = A + 20

3.  Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar:
    B = D + 10

Our goal is to find the number of points Azibo scored (A).

Let's express B and D in terms of A using the relationships provided:
From (2), we already have B = A + 20.

From (3), we can express D in terms of B: D = B - 10.
Now, substitute the expression for B from (2) into this equation for D:
D = (A + 20) - 10
D = A + 10

Now we have B and D expressed in terms of A:
*   B = A + 20
*   D = A + 10

Substitute these expressions for B and D into the total points equation (1):
(A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45

Combine the terms with A:
A + A + A = 3A

Combine the constant terms:
20 + 10 = 30

So the equation becomes:
3A + 30 = 45

Now, solve for A:
3A = 45 - 30
3A = 15
A = 15 / 3
A = 5

Azibo scored 5 points.

Let's verify the scores:
*   Azibo (A) = 5 points
*   Bahati (B) = A + 20 = 5 + 20 = 25 points
*   Dinar (D) = A + 10 = 5 + 10 = 15 points

Total points: 25 + 5 + 15 = 45 points. This matches the given total.
Bahati's points (25) are 20 more than Azibo's (5). (25 - 5 = 20)
Bahati's points (25) are 10 more than Dinar's (15). (25 - 15 = 10)
Bahati scored the most points (25).

All conditions are satisfied.

- Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe together caught 339 Pokémon.
- Alex caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan.
- Stan caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe caught.

Let’s define the variables:
- Let \( A \) be the number of Pokémon Alex caught.
- Let \( S \) be the number of Pokémon Stan caught.
- Let \( D \) be the number of Pokémon Adelwolfe caught.

From the problem, we can set up the following equations:
1. \( A + S + D = 339 \) (total Pokémon caught)
2. \( A = S + 5 \) (Alex caught 5 more than Stan)
3. \( S = 4D - 13 \) (Stan caught 13 less than 4 times what Adelwolfe caught)

Substitute equation 2 into equation 1:
\[
(S + 5) + S + D = 339
\]
\[
2S + D + 5 = 339
\]
\[
2S + D = 334 \quad \text{(equation 4)}
\]

Now substitute equation 3 into equation 4:
\[
2(4D - 13) + D = 334
\]
\[
8D - 26 + D = 334
\]
\[
9D - 26 = 334
\]
\[
9D = 360
\]
\[
D = 40
\]

Now plug \( D = 40 \) back into equation 3:
\[
S = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
\]

So, Stan caught 147 Pokémon.

To verify:
- Adelwolfe caught 40 Pokémon.
- Stan caught 147 Pokémon.
- Alex caught \( S + 5 = 147 + 5 = 152 \) Pokémon.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Identify the number of states in the USA:** The USA has 50 states.
2. **Apply the given relationship:** India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA.  
   - Half of the USA's states: \( 50 \div 2 = 25 \).  
   - Add 4 to that: \( 25 + 4 = 29 \).  
   So, based on the problem, India has 29 states.

From the problem, we know the following:

1. \( B = 30 \) (Robert has 30 cherries)
2. \( B = R + 10 \) (Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard)

Using the second equation, we can substitute \( B \) with 30:

\[
30 = R + 10
\]

Now, we can solve for \( R \):

\[
R = 30 - 10 = 20

So, Richard has 20 cherries.

Next, we know that the total number of cherries shared among Richard, Jerry, and Robert is 60:

Since Halley's Comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we can determine the timeline of events:

1. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
2. The next time the comet appeared, Bill's dad would be \( 30 + 75 = 105 \) years old.
3. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet the first time.

Now, we need to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time. 

Let’s denote the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time as \( x \). The second time Bill saw the comet, he was three times the age of his father when he first saw it:

- Bill's dad's age when he first saw the comet = 30 years.
- Therefore, when Bill saw the comet the second time, he was \( 3 \times 30 = 90 \) years old.

Now, we can set up the equation based on the timeline:

- The first time Bill saw the comet, his dad was 30 years old.
- The second time, 75 years later, Bill's dad was 105 years old.
- The difference in age between Bill and his dad remains constant.

Thus, the age difference between Bill and his dad is:

When Bill saw the comet for the second time, he was 90 years old, and his dad was 105 years old. The age difference should still be the same:

We know that the total age of the children is 20 years:

gsm8k,gsm8k-999,Random,1,"To solve the problem, we need to determine how to divide the watermelon among the family members while adhering to the condition that each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid.

Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( k \). Since there are 4 kids, the total size of the slices for the kids is:

\[
\text{Total size for kids} = 4k
\]

Each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, so each adult's slice is:

\[
\text{Size of each adult's slice} = 2k
\]

Since there are 2 adults, the total size of the slices for the adults is:

\[
\text{Total size for adults} = 2 \times (2k) = 4k
\]

Now, we can find the total size of the watermelon by adding the total sizes for both adults and kids:

\[
\text{Total size of watermelon} = \text{Total size for kids} + \text{Total size for adults} = 4k + 4k = 8k
\]

Next, we need to find out what percentage of the watermelon each adult gets. The size of each adult's slice is \( 2k \), and the total size of the watermelon is \( 8k \). The percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Percentage for each adult} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of each adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of watermelon}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2k}{8k} \right) \times 100
\]

Simplifying this expression:

\[
\text{Percentage for each adult} = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\%

### Step 1: Calculate the number of female porcupines
- The total population is 50 porcupines.
- The number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population.
- Calculation: (3/5) × 50 = (3 × 50) / 5 = 150 / 5 = 30 female porcupines.

### Step 2: Determine the number of babies born per month
- Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.
- With 30 female porcupines, the total number of babies born per month is: 30 × 4 = 120 babies.

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of babies born in a year
- A year has 12 months.
- Total babies born in a year: 120 babies/month × 12 months = 1,440 babies.

### Step 4: Calculate the total population after a year
- The initial population is 50 porcupines.
- These 50 porcupines include the original females and any males or non-reproducing females.
- The 1,440 babies are added to the population.
- Final population: Initial population + Total babies = 50 + 1,440 = 1,490 porcupines.

### Assumptions:
- The babies born are added to the population immediately and survive.
- The problem does not specify the gender of the babies or when they might mature and reproduce, so I am assuming that only the original 30 female porcupines give birth during this year.
- No mortality or other factors (like migration) are mentioned, so they are not considered.

**Given information:**
- Initial price: $120
- Annual increase: 5% of the original price
- Time period: 3 years

**Step-by-step solution:**

Let me clarify the problem first. The phrase ""5% of the original price every year"" means each year the price increases by 5% of $120 (not compound interest).

**Year 0 (Initial):** $120

**Year 1:** 
- Increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 × $120 = $6
- New price = $120 + $6 = $126

**Year 2:**
- Increase = 5% of $120 = $6
- New price = $126 + $6 = $132

**Year 3:**
- Increase = 5% of $120 = $6
- New price = $132 + $6 = $138

**Alternative formula:**
Price after n years = Original price + (n × 5% × Original price)
Price after 3 years = $120 + (3 × 0.05 × $120)
Price after 3 years = $120 + (3 × $6)
Price after 3 years = $120 + $18

gsm8k,gsm8k-1028,Random,1,"Let me break this down step by step to determine how much Tom has to pay per month.

1. **Initial cost of the bedroom set**: Tom buys the bedroom set for $3000.

2. **Partial payment from selling his old bedroom**: He sells his old bedroom for $1000 and uses that amount to pay toward the bedroom set.  
   - Remaining balance: $3000 - $1000 = $2000.

3. **Interpreting ""10% a month""**: The statement says he has to pay 10% a month for the bedroom set. This likely means he needs to pay 10% of the remaining balance each month as his monthly payment.  
   - 10% of the remaining balance ($2000) = 0.10 × $2000 = $200.

Therefore, Tom has to pay **$200 per month**.

### Step 1: Initial balloons
Sally starts with:
- 25 red balloons
- 7 green balloons
- 12 yellow balloons

Total initial balloons: 25 + 7 + 12 = 44

### Step 2: Red balloons bursting
- 40% of the red balloons burst.
- 40% of 25 = 0.40 × 25 = 10 balloons burst.
- Remaining red balloons: 25 - 10 = 15

Now, Sally has:
- Red: 15
- Green: 7
- Yellow: 12
- Total: 15 + 7 + 12 = 34

### Step 3: Yellow balloons released
- She accidentally releases half of the yellow balloons.
- Half of 12 = 0.50 × 12 = 6 balloons released.
- Remaining yellow balloons: 12 - 6 = 6

Now, Sally has:
- Red: 15
- Green: 7
- Yellow: 6
- Total: 15 + 7 + 6 = 28

### Step 4: Blue balloons added
- She finds 8 blue balloons in a tree.
- She adds 75% of them to her remaining balloons.
- 75% of 8 = 0.75 × 8 = 6 balloons added.

Final balloons:
- Red: 15
- Green: 7
- Yellow: 6
- Blue: 6 (added)
- Total: 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34

gsm8k,gsm8k-1030,Random,1,"I need to find the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow.

Let me think through this step by step by identifying when Marcus WILL have to turn in homework.

Marcus will have to turn in homework only if ALL of the following happen:
1. The normal teacher comes in (not a substitute)
2. The teacher does NOT give everyone an extension
3. Marcus does NOT successfully use the ""dog ate homework"" excuse

Let me calculate the probability of each:

**Step 1: Normal teacher comes in**
- Probability of substitute = 50%
- Probability of normal teacher = 50% = 0.5

**Step 2: No class extension (given normal teacher is there)**
- Probability of extension = 40%
- Probability of NO extension = 60% = 0.6

**Step 3: Marcus can't get personal extension (given no class extension)**
- Probability Marcus gets personal extension = 20%
- Probability Marcus does NOT get personal extension = 80% = 0.8

**Final Calculation:**
Since all three conditions must happen for Marcus to turn in homework, I multiply the probabilities:

Probability = 0.5 × 0.6 × 0.8 = 0.24 = 24%

**Answer: There is a 24% chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow.**

2. **Tuesday's Delivery:**
   - Letters delivered on Tuesday = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 425 + 17 \)
   - First, calculate one-fifth of Monday's delivery:

- The second person took $80 more than the first person.
- The third person took twice as much as the second person.

Let’s denote:
- The first person’s share as \( x \) dollars.
- The second person’s share as \( x + 80 \) dollars (since it’s $80 more than the first).
- The third person’s share as \( 2 \times (x + 80) \) dollars (twice the second person’s share).

The total amount they divided is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

\[
x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920
\]

Now, simplify the equation step by step:

1. Expand the terms:
   \[
   x + x + 80 + 2(x + 80) = 1920
   \]
   \[
   x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920
   \]

2. Combine like terms:
   \[
   x + x + 2x + 80 + 160 = 1920
   \]
   \[
   4x + 240 = 1920
   \]

3. Subtract 240 from both sides:
   \[
   4x = 1920 - 240
   \]
   \[
   4x = 1680
   \]

4. Divide both sides by 4:
   \[
   x = \frac{1680}{4}

   \[
   x = 420

So, the first person’s share is $420.

To verify:
- First person: $420
- Second person: $420 + 80 = $500
- Third person: 2 × $500 = $1000
- Total: $420 + $500 + $1000 = $1920

gsm8k,gsm8k-1048,Random,1,"To determine the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the value after it depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year for 3 years (from 2007 to 2010).

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the problem**:  
   - Initial price of the car (P0): $20,000  
   - Depreciation rate: 21% per year, which means the car retains 79% of its value each year (100% - 21% = 79%).  
   - Time period: 2010 - 2007 = 3 years.  

2. **Use the exponential decay formula**:  
   The formula for the future value after depreciation is:  
   \[
   P = P0 \times (1 - r)^t
   \]  
   Where:  
   - \(P\) is the final price.  
   - \(P0\) is the initial price ($20,000).  
   - \(r\) is the depreciation rate (0.21).  
   - \(t\) is the number of years (3).  

   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   P = 20,000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 = 20,000 \times (0.79)^3
   \]

3. **Calculate step by step**:  
   - First, compute \(0.79^2\):  
     \[
     0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.6241
     \]  
   - Next, compute \(0.6241 \times 0.79\):  
     \[
     0.6241 \times 0.79 = 0.493039
     \]  
   - Now, multiply by the initial price:  
     \[
     20,000 \times 0.493039 = 9,860.78
     \]

4. **Final price**:  
   The price of the car in 2010 is approximately **$9,860.78**. (Currency is typically rounded to two decimal places.)

1. **Calculate weekly sheets:**
   - Twin beds: 4 beds × 1 set of sheets per bed = 4 twin sets
   - King bed: 1 bed × 1 set of sheets = 1 king set
   - Total sheets per week = 4 twin sets + 1 king set = 5 sets of sheets

2. **Calculate loads of laundry per week:**
   - Greg can wash 2 twin sets at a time. Therefore, for 4 twin sets:
     - 4 twin sets ÷ 2 twin sets per load = 2 loads for twin sheets
   - Greg can wash 1 king set at a time, so he needs:
     - 1 load for the king sheets
   - Total loads per week = 2 loads (twin) + 1 load (king) = 3 loads

3. **Calculate total loads of laundry in a year:**

   \]

2. **Slices eaten by Becky**: 
   We know from the problem that Becky ate 10 slices.

3. **Slices eaten by Jake**: 
   According to the problem, Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake. Therefore, if Becky ate 10 slices:
   \[
   \text{Becky} = \text{Jake} + 3
   \]
   Substituting Becky's slices:
   \[
   10 = \text{Jake} + 3
   \]
   Solving for Jake:
   \[
   \text{Jake} = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ slices}

gsm8k,gsm8k-1083,Random,1,"To determine how much Jenny saved by buying bananas in bunches instead of individually, let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought.
- Jenny buys 10 bunches.
- Each bunch has an average of 4 bananas.
- Total bananas = 10 bunches × 4 bananas/bunch = 40 bananas.

### Step 2: Calculate the cost if Jenny bought all the bananas individually.
- The cost of one banana is $0.80.
- For 40 bananas, the cost would be: 40 bananas × $0.80/banana = $32.00.

### Step 3: Calculate the actual cost Jenny paid by buying bunches.
- Each bunch costs $3.00.
- For 10 bunches, the cost is: 10 bunches × $3.00/bunch = $30.00.

### Step 4: Calculate the savings.
- Savings = Cost of buying individually - Cost of buying bunches
- Savings = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

Therefore, Jenny saved **$2.00** by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.",0.0003291,7.501723289489746,0,0,grok-3-mini,,,1

We know two things:

### Step 1: Identify the key details
- **Total bikes sold**: 300
- **Breakdown of bikes**:
  - Trekking bikes: Half of the total, so \( 0.5 \times 300 = 150 \) bikes
  - BMX bikes: 15% of the total, so \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \) bikes
  - MTB bikes: The rest, so \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \) bikes
- **Prices**:
  - MTB: $500 per bike
  - BMX: Half the price of an MTB, so \( 0.5 \times 500 = 250 \) dollars per bike
  - Trekking: $450 per bike

### Step 2: Calculate revenue for each type of bike
- **Revenue from MTB bikes**: \( 105 \times 500 = 52,500 \) dollars
- **Revenue from BMX bikes**: \( 45 \times 250 = 11,250 \) dollars
- **Revenue from Trekking bikes**: \( 150 \times 450 = 67,500 \) dollars

### Step 3: Calculate total earnings
- Total earnings = Revenue from MTB + Revenue from BMX + Revenue from Trekking
- Total earnings = \( 52,500 + 11,250 + 67,500 = 131,250 \) dollars

### Step 1: Initial setup
- There are 12 sodas in total.
- 3 of them are shaken.
- This means 9 are unshaken (12 - 3 = 9).

### Step 2: Ellen takes a soda
- Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda.
- Shaken sodas left: 3 (unchanged).
- Unshaken sodas left: 9 - 1 = 8.
- Total sodas left: 12 - 1 = 11.

### Step 3: Ellen's brother takes sodas
- The brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas.
- Shaken sodas left: 3 - 1 = 2.
- Unshaken sodas left: 8 - 2 = 6.
- Total sodas left: 11 - 3 = 8 (since he took 3 sodas in total).

### Step 4: Ellen's friend picks a soda
- The friend will pick one soda at random from the 8 remaining sodas.
- There are 2 shaken sodas out of these 8.
- The probability of picking a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas:  
  \[

### Step 5: Convert to percentage

- 2 workers produce 4 toys/hour each
- 1 worker produces unknown toys/hour (let's call this x)
- They all work for 10 hours
- After the shift, they still need 20 more toys

**Step 1: Calculate how many toys were actually produced**

If they need 20 more toys to complete the 400-toy order, then they produced:

- Valerie's salary is 1/2 of her brother's salary.
- Let B be her brother's salary.
- Therefore, $5000 = \frac{1}{2} \times B$

2.  **Probability of the second ticket winning:**
    The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first.

3.  **Probability of both tickets winning:**
    Since the two lottery tickets are independent events (winning one doesn't affect the other), to find the probability that both win, we multiply their individual probabilities.
    P(Both win) = P(Ticket 1 wins) * P(Ticket 2 wins)
    P(Both win) = 0.20 * 0.60

- Let \( C \) be the number of seashells Carlos collected.
- Let \( J \) be the number of seashells Jim collected.
- Let \( R \) be the number of seashells Carrey collected.

From the problem, we know the following:

1. Jim collected 27 seashells:  
   \( J = 27 \)

2. Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos:  
   \( J = C + 5 \)  
   Substituting \( J \) gives:  
   \( 27 = C + 5 \)  
   Therefore,  
   \( C = 27 - 5 = 22 \)

3. Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey:  
   \( C = 2R \)  
   Substituting \( C \) gives:  
   \( 22 = 2R \)  
   Therefore,

Now we have the number of seashells collected by each person:

*   Red rope length: R
*   Blue rope length: B
*   Yellow rope length: Y

From the problem statement, we can form the following equations:

1.  ""The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope.""
    R = 4B

2.  ""The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.""
    B = Y - 7
    This can also be rewritten as Y = B + 7

3.  ""If the 3 ropes had a combined length of 37 centimeters""
    R + B + Y = 37

Now, we can substitute the expressions for R and Y from equations (1) and (2) into equation (3) to solve for B:

Substitute R = 4B and Y = B + 7 into R + B + Y = 37:
(4B) + B + (B + 7) = 37

Combine the terms with B:
4B + B + B + 7 = 37
6B + 7 = 37

Subtract 7 from both sides:
6B = 37 - 7
6B = 30

Divide by 6 to find B:
B = 30 / 6
B = 5

So, the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters.

Now that we have the length of the blue rope (B), we can find the length of the red rope (R) using equation (1):
R = 4B
R = 4 * 5

1. **Determine the initial amounts:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so:
     \[
     \text{Rissa's amount} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars}

2. **Let \( x \) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.**

1. **Building Rate**: Jay can build 20 snowballs in 1 hour (60 minutes). This means he builds:
   \[
   \text{Rate of building} = \frac{20 \text{ snowballs}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ snowballs per minute}

2. **Melting Rate**: Jay loses 2 snowballs every 15 minutes. Therefore, the melting rate is:
   \[
   \text{Rate of melting} = \frac{2 \text{ snowballs}}{15 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{2}{15} \text{ snowballs per minute}
   \]

3. **Net Rate**: To find the net rate of snowballs Jay has after accounting for melting, we subtract the melting rate from the building rate:
   \[
   \text{Net rate} = \frac{1}{3} - \frac{2}{15}
   \]
   To perform this subtraction, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 15 is 15. Thus, we convert \(\frac{1}{3}\) to have a denominator of 15:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} = \frac{5}{15}

   Now we can subtract:

2. **Cognac Purchase**:
   - John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as he did scotch. Since he bought 10 bottles of scotch, he buys:
     \[
     2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac}
     \]

3. **Cost of Cognac**:
   - The cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

     \[
     \text{Total spending} = \text{Total cost of scotch} + \text{Total cost of cognac} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars}

1. **First Day Planting:**
   - Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
   - He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak. Therefore, the number of Lodgepole Pine trees he planted is:
     \[
     2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ Lodgepole Pine trees}
     \]

2. **Total Trees Planted on the First Day:**
   - The total number of trees planted on the first day is:
     \[

     \]

3. **Second Day Planting:**
   - On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees than the first day:
     \[
     20 + 10 = 30 \text{ White Oak trees}
     \]
   - He also planted \( \frac{1}{4} \) more Lodgepole Pine trees than he planted on the first day. The number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day was 40, so:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10

   - Therefore, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees he planted on the second day is:
     \[
     40 + 10 = 50 \text{ Lodgepole Pine trees}
     \]

4. **Total Trees Planted on the Second Day:**
   - The total number of trees planted on the second day is:
     \[

5. **Total Trees Planted Over Two Days:**
   - Finally, we add the total trees planted on both days:
     \[
     60 \text{ (First Day)} + 80 \text{ (Second Day)} = 140 \text{ trees}

### Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem states: ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is 40.""  
Let’s denote the number of coffee mugs as \( x \).

### Step 2: Translate into an equation
- Four times the number of coffee mugs is \( 4x \).
- Eight more than that is \( 4x + 8 \).
- According to the problem, this equals 40:  
  \[
  4x + 8 = 40
  \]

### Step 3: Solve the equation
- Subtract 8 from both sides:  
  \[
  4x = 40 - 8
  \]
  \[
  4x = 32
  \]
- Divide both sides by 4:  
  \[
  x = \frac{32}{4}
  \]
  \[
  x = 8
  \]

### Step 4: Interpret the result
The number of coffee mugs is 8.

### Verification
If there are 8 coffee mugs:  
- Four times 8 is \( 4 \times 8 = 32 \).  
- Eight more than 32 is \( 32 + 8 = 40 \), which matches the problem statement.

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- Mattison's height is 60 inches.
- The total height of the two-story house is 7 times Mattison's height.
- The height from the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice Mattison's height.

### Step 2: Calculate the total height of the house
- Total height = 7 × Mattison's height
- Total height = 7 × 60 inches = 420 inches

This means the house, from the ground to the roof, is 420 inches tall.

### Step 3: Calculate the height of the first floor
- Height of the first floor (floor to ceiling) = 3 × Mattison's height
- Height of the first floor = 3 × 60 inches = 180 inches

### Step 1: Calculate the total volume of the jar
The jar has a square base of 6 inches by 6 inches and a height of 15 inches.  
- Volume of the jar = length × width × height  
- Volume = 6 inches × 6 inches × 15 inches = 540 cubic inches

### Step 2: Account for packing efficiency
The packing efficiency is 80%, meaning only 80% of the jar's volume is effectively used for jelly beans.  
- Effective volume = 80% of 540 cubic inches  
- Effective volume = 0.80 × 540 = 432 cubic inches

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of jelly beans
Each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches.  
- Total number of jelly beans = Effective volume ÷ Volume per jelly bean  
- Total number of jelly beans = 432 ÷ 0.15 = 2880

### Step 4: Calculate Tim's estimate for red jelly beans
Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red.  
- Estimated red jelly beans = 30% of total jelly beans  
- Estimated red jelly beans = 0.30 × 2880 = 864

### Step 5: Compare Tim's guess to the true number
The true number of red jelly beans is 900.  
- Difference = |Tim's guess - True number|

### Step 1: Identify the total number of students.
- There are students in grades 4 through 7, which means 4 grades.
- In each grade, 10 students qualify.
- Total qualifying students: 4 grades × 10 students/grade = 40 students.

### Step 2: Determine the group size and number of groups.
- Only 8 students can try the escape room at a time.
- Total students divided by students per group: 40 students ÷ 8 students/group = 5 groups.

### Step 3: Calculate the time for each group and the total time.

**Given information:**
- Carly makes brownies and cupcakes
- Brownies = 3 × cupcakes - 2
- There are 5 people in the class
- Each person gets 2 treats
- Total treats = brownies + cupcakes

**Step 1: Find the total number of treats**
- 5 people × 2 treats per person = 10 treats total

**Step 2: Set up equations**
Let c = number of cupcakes

Then:
- Brownies = 3c - 2

gsm8k,gsm8k-1234,Random,1,"Let N_last_year be the number of novels Regina wrote last year.
Let N_this_year be the number of novels Regina has written this year.

According to the problem:
1. Regina wrote 9 novels last year.
So, N_last_year = 9.

2. This (referring to the 9 novels written last year) is 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year.
This can be written as an equation:
N_last_year = (3/4) * N_this_year

Now, substitute the value of N_last_year into the equation:
9 = (3/4) * N_this_year

To find N_this_year, we need to isolate it. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of (3/4), which is (4/3):
N_this_year = 9 * (4/3)

N_this_year = (9 * 4) / 3
N_this_year = 36 / 3
N_this_year = 12

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

To verify:
3 quarters of 12 novels is (3/4) * 12 = 3 * (12/4) = 3 * 3 = 9.
This matches the 9 novels she wrote last year.

### Step 1: Understand the events
- Madeline ate 6 grapes.
- Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used \(5 \times 6 = 30\) grapes.
- Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes, so she used \(4 \times 12 = 48\) grapes.

### Step 2: Work backwards from the end
- The mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, which means the grapes left after Madeline and her brother were exactly 48.
- Before the mother used the grapes, the amount left was the total initial grapes minus what Madeline and her brother used.
- Let \(T\) be the total initial number of grapes.
- Madeline ate 6 grapes, so after her, there were \(T - 6\) grapes left.
- Her brother then used 30 grapes, so after him, there were \((T - 6) - 30 = T - 36\) grapes left.
- We know this amount (\(T - 36\)) must equal 48 grapes (for the pies).

### Step 3: Solve for \(T\)
- Set up the equation: \(T - 36 = 48\)
- Add 36 to both sides: \(T = 48 + 36\)
- \(T = 84\)

### Step 4: Verify
- Start with 84 grapes.
- Madeline eats 6: 84 - 6 = 78 grapes left.
- Brother uses 30: 78 - 30 = 48 grapes left.
- Mother uses 48 for 4 pies: Exactly matches.

- The bottom shelf holds twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it holds \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.

Out of these remaining 50 hats, \( \frac{3}{5} \) are blue, so the number of blue hats is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \).

The rest of the remaining hats are white, so the number of white hats is \( 50 - 30 = 20 \).

Alternatively, using fractions:
- Fraction of red hats: \( \frac{1}{2} \).
- Fraction of remaining hats: \( 1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \).
- Fraction of blue hats: \( \frac{3}{5} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{10} \).
- Fraction of white hats: \( \frac{1}{2} - \frac{3}{10} = \frac{5}{10} - \frac{3}{10} = \frac{2}{10} = \frac{1}{5} \) (since white hats are the rest after blue, or \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the remaining \( \frac{1}{2} \), which is \( \frac{2}{5} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{10} = \frac{1}{5} \)).

- Weight of the car: 1200 pounds
- Weight of the luggage: 250 pounds
- Weight of the two children: 75 pounds each, so for both children, it's 75 × 2 = 150 pounds

Total weight = Weight of the car + Weight of the luggage + Weight of the children

First, the company produces 5000 bars per day. They sell each bar for $2. I need to find out how much money they make in two weeks.

Two weeks is 14 days. So, in 14 days, the total number of bars produced is 5000 bars/day multiplied by 14 days.

Let me calculate that: 5000 × 14.

5000 × 10 = 50,000

5000 × 4 = 20,000

So, 50,000 + 20,000 = 70,000 bars.

Therefore, in two weeks, they produce 70,000 bars.

Each bar sells for $2, so the total revenue is 70,000 bars × $2 per bar.

70,000 × 2 = 140,000.

So, the company will receive $140,000.

I should make sure about the time frame. Two weeks is indeed 14 days. Also, the problem says ""during two weeks,"" and since they produce every day, including weekends, I assume, unless specified otherwise. The problem doesn't mention any days off, so I'll go with 7 days a week.

Also, it says they sell all produced bars, so no issue with unsold inventory.

So, step by step:

Daily production: 5000 bars

Selling price per bar: $2

Daily revenue: 5000 × 2 = $10,000

Number of days in two weeks: 14 days

Total revenue: 10,000 × 14 = $140,000

Using total bars: 5000 × 14 = 70,000 bars

Revenue: 70,000 × 2 = $140,000

Same answer.

I think that's correct.
</think>The company produces 5000 bars per day and sells each bar for $2. To find the total revenue over two weeks (14 days), follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the T-shirts
- Jake buys 2 T-shirts, each with an original price of $8.
- The deal is ""buy one get one 50% off,"" which means he pays full price for the first T-shirt and 50% off for the second one.
- Cost of the first T-shirt: $8 (full price).
- Cost of the second T-shirt: 50% of $8 = 0.5 × $8 = $4.
- Total cost for the T-shirts: $8 + $4 = $12.

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the shoes
- The original price of the shoes is $40.
- The shoes are 40% off, so the discount is 40% of $40 = 0.4 × $40 = $16.
- Price after discount: $40 - $16 = $24.

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount spent

### Step 1: Calculate Ryan's total allowance.
- Ryan earns $6 per week.
- He did his chores for 3 weeks.
- Total allowance: \( 6 \times 3 = 18 \) dollars.

So, Ryan has $18.

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the ice cream cones.
- Ryan buys ice cream for himself and 3 friends, which is 4 people.
- Each ice cream cone costs $1.25.
- Total cost for ice cream: \( 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \) dollars.

### Step 3: Subtract the ice cream cost from his total allowance.

### Step 4: Determine how many movie tickets he can buy.
- Each movie ticket costs $6.50.

First, Janet spends money on several items: ice cream, movie tickets, and a bracelet. The costs are:

- Ice cream: $3.50

- Movie tickets: $7.50 each for herself and her younger sister. That means two tickets, so I need to calculate the total for tickets.

Cost per ticket: $7.50

Number of tickets: 2 (for herself and her sister)

So, total for movie tickets: 2 * $7.50 = $15.00

- Bracelet: $8.50

Now, add up all her spending:

Ice cream: $3.50

Movie tickets: $15.00

Bracelet: $8.50

Total spending = $3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50

Let me compute that step by step:

First, $3.50 + $15.00 = $18.50

Then, $18.50 + $8.50 = $27.00

So, total spending is $27.00.

Her parents gave her $40.00.

To find out how much she has left, subtract the total spending from the amount she was given.

Amount left = $40.00 - $27.00 = $13.00

I should double-check the addition.

Items:

- Ice cream: 3.50

- Movie tickets: 7.50 * 2 = 15.00

- Bracelet: 8.50

Now, 3.50 + 15.00 = 18.50

18.50 + 8.50 = 27.00, yes.

40.00 - 27.00 = 13.00

The question asks for ""how many dollars,"" so it should be a numerical value, probably in dollars without cents, but since it's money, I should express it clearly.

In the answer, it says ""dollars,"" so $13 or 13 dollars is fine.

But let me make sure about the movie tickets. It says ""$7.50 each for movie tickets for herself and her younger sister."" So yes, two people, so two tickets.

Also, no other expenses mentioned, so that's all.

Initial amount: $40

Spent:

- Ice cream: 3.50

- Tickets: 7.50 x 2 = 15.00

- Bracelet: 8.50

Total spent: 3.50 + 15.00 = 18.50; 18.50 + 8.50 = 27.00

Left: 40.00 - 27.00 = 13.00

So, she has $13.00 left.

The answer should be 13 dollars.

But the question says ""how many dollars,"" so I think just 13 is fine, or should I write it as a number?

I can write it as 13.

### Step 1: Understand what Igor gathered
- Dr. Grumpus requested:
  - 16 test tubes
  - 7 beakers
  - 14 Petri dishes

- Igor gathered:
  - Half as many test tubes as requested:  
    \( 16 \div 2 = 8 \) test tubes.
  - Two more than the number of Petri dishes requested:  
    This means Igor gathered \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes.
  - The correct number of beakers initially (7), but he lost some on the way.

### Step 2: Set up the equation for the total items
- Igor placed a total of 29 items on the lab bench.
- Let \( B \) be the number of beakers Igor actually placed on the bench.
- The total items placed:  
  \( \text{Test tubes} + \text{Beakers placed} + \text{Petri dishes} = 29 \)  
  \( 8 + B + 16 = 29 \)

### Step 3: Solve for \( B \)
- Simplify the equation:  
  \( 8 + 16 + B = 29 \)  
  \( 24 + B = 29 \)  
  \( B = 29 - 24 \)  
  \( B = 5 \)

So, Igor placed 5 beakers on the bench.

gsm8k,gsm8k-1310,Random,1,"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Determine Aaron's distance:**
*   Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron.
*   Vanessa ran 4 miles.
*   So, Aaron ran 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles.

**2. Determine Aaron's speed:**
*   Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes.
*   Aaron's speed = Distance / Time = 2 miles / 16 minutes = 1/8 miles per minute.

**3. Determine Vanessa's speed:**
*   Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa. This means Vanessa's speed is half of Aaron's speed.
*   Vanessa's speed = (1/8 miles per minute) / 2 = 1/16 miles per minute.

**4. Determine Vanessa's time:**
*   Vanessa ran 4 miles.
*   Vanessa's speed is 1/16 miles per minute.
*   Vanessa's time = Distance / Speed = 4 miles / (1/16 miles per minute) = 4 * 16 minutes = 64 minutes.

**Alternatively, using direct ratios:**
Let S_A be Aaron's speed and S_V be Vanessa's speed.
Let D_A be Aaron's distance and D_V be Vanessa's distance.
Let T_A be Aaron's time and T_V be Vanessa's time.

We are given:
1.  S_A = 2 * S_V  => S_V = S_A / 2
2.  D_V = 2 * D_A
3.  T_A = 16 minutes

We know that Time = Distance / Speed.
So, T_V = D_V / S_V

Substitute the given relationships:
T_V = (2 * D_A) / (S_A / 2)
T_V = 4 * (D_A / S_A)

We also know that T_A = D_A / S_A.
Therefore, T_V = 4 * T_A

Now, plug in Aaron's time:
T_V = 4 * 16 minutes
T_V = 64 minutes

1. **Calculate the total line required:**  
   The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. There are 200 feet of dock, so:  
   Total line required = 3 feet per foot of dock × 200 feet of dock = 600 feet of line.

2. **Account for the line he already has:**  
   He currently has 6 feet of new line. Therefore, the amount he needs to buy is:

gsm8k,gsm8k-1312,Random,1,"To calculate the weekly revenue for Tom's restaurant, we need to determine the revenue per reservation, per night, and then per week.

### Step 1: Revenue per reservation
- Each reservation orders 2 meals at $5 each:  
  \(2 \times 5 = \$10\)  
- Each reservation also orders 1 bottle of wine at $5:  
  \(\$5\)  
- Total per reservation:  
  \(10 + 5 = \$15\)

### Step 2: Revenue per night
- The restaurant gets 6 reservations per night:  
  \(6 \times 15 = \$90\)

### Step 3: Revenue per week
- The restaurant is open 2 days per week:  
  \(2 \times 90 = \$180\)

Thus, the restaurant makes $180 per week in revenue.

gsm8k,gsm8k-1313,Random,1,"The fruit vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80.  
- Total cost price = $80  
- Profit percentage = 25%  

**Step 1: Calculate total profit**  
Profit = 25% of cost price  
= \( \frac{25}{100} \times 80 \)  
= \( 0.25 \times 80 \)  
= $20  

**Step 2: Calculate total selling price**  
Selling price = Cost price + Profit

**Step 3: Calculate selling price per watermelon**  
Each watermelon sold for:  
\( \frac{\text{Total selling price}}{\text{Number of watermelons}} = \frac{100}{50} \)
