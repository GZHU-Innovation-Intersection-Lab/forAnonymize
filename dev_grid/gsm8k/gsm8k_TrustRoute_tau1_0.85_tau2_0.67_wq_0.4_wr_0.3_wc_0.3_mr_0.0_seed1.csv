1. **Calculate the total investment**:
   - Purchase price of the house: $80,000
   - Repair costs: $50,000
   - Total investment = Purchase price + Repair costs
   \[
   \text{Total investment} = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the increased value of the house**:
   - The value of the house increased by 150%. 
   - To find the new value, we first calculate 150% of the original purchase price:
   \[
   \text{Increase in value} = 150\% \times 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000
   \]
   - Now, add this increase to the original purchase price to find the new value of the house:
   \[
   \text{New value of the house} = 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the profit**:
   - Profit is calculated as the new value of the house minus the total investment:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{New value of the house} - \text{Total investment}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000

Let me break down the costs and revenue:

**Initial cost:**
- Planting the tree: $90

**Annual revenue:**
- 7 lemons × $1.5 per lemon = $10.50 per year

**Annual costs:**
- Water and feed: $3 per year

**Net annual profit:**
- $10.50 - $3 = $7.50 per year

**Finding the break-even point:**

I need to find when total earnings exceed total costs:
- Total costs = $90 (initial) + $3 × (number of years)
- Total revenue = $10.50 × (number of years)
- Net profit = Total revenue - Total costs

### Step 1: Identify the guesses
- The first friend guesses: 80 jelly beans.
- The second friend guesses: 20 more than half of the first friend's guess.
  - Half of 80 is \( 80 \div 2 = 40 \).
  - Adding 20 to that: \( 40 + 20 = 60 \).
  - So, the second guess is 60.
- The third friend guesses: 25% more than the first friend's guess.
  - 25% of 80 is \( 0.25 \times 80 = 20 \).
  - Adding that to the original guess: \( 80 + 20 = 100 \).
  - So, the third guess is 100.

The three guesses are: 80, 60, and 100.

### Step 2: Calculate the average
To find the average, add the guesses together and divide by the number of guesses (which is 3).

- Sum of the guesses: \( 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \).
- Average: \( 240 \div 3 = 80 \).

2. **Total daily time for all dogs**: With 10 dogs, the total time per day is 10 dogs × 0.5 hours/dog = 5 hours per day.
3. **Weekly time**: There are 7 days in a week, so the total time per week is 5 hours/day × 7 days = 35 hours per week.

According to the problem, we have the following two equations:

1. The total number of coins is 110:
   \[
   S + G = 110
   \]

2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins:
   \[
   G = S + 30
   \]

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:

\[
S + (S + 30) = 110
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2S + 30 = 110
\]

Next, we subtract 30 from both sides:

\[
2S = 80
\]

Now, divide both sides by 2:

\[
S = 40
\]

Now that we have the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:

### Step 1: Calculate the dog food used in the first 180 days
- The puppy needs 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days.
- Total cups for this period:  
  \( 180 \, \text{days} \times 1 \, \text{cup/day} = 180 \, \text{cups} \)

### Step 2: Calculate the dog food used for the remaining days in the year
- There are 365 days in a year, so the remaining days after the first 180 are:  
  \( 365 \, \text{days} - 180 \, \text{days} = 185 \, \text{days} \)
- For these 185 days, the puppy needs 2 cups per day.
- Total cups for this period:

- Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
- Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah.
- Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David.

### Step 2: Calculate David's laundry
- Sarah does 4 times as much as David.
- So, David's laundry = Sarah's laundry ÷ 4
- David's laundry = 400 ÷ 4 = 100 pounds.

### Step 3: Calculate Raymond's laundry
- Raymond does half as much as Sarah.
- So, Raymond's laundry = Sarah's laundry ÷ 2
- Raymond's laundry = 400 ÷ 2 = 200 pounds.

### Step 4: Find the difference
- The difference is the amount Raymond does minus the amount David does.
- Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry
- Difference = 200 - 100 = 100 pounds.

### Final Answer
Raymond does 200 pounds of laundry, and David does 100 pounds. The difference between the amount they do is 100 pounds. Let me know if you'd like me to explain any part further!",0.0049025,13.535900115966797,0,0,cand-grok-3-mini,stage2_vote,

### Step 1: Calculate the cost for 18 flowers using each option.
- **Option 1: Packages of 3 flowers for $2.50 each**  
  - Number of packages needed: 18 ÷ 3 = 6 packages  
  - Total cost: 6 × $2.50 = $15.00

- **Option 2: Packages of 2 flowers for $1 each**  
  - Number of packages needed: 18 ÷ 2 = 9 packages  
  - Total cost: 9 × $1 = $9.00

### Step 2: Identify the better (cheaper) option.
- Option 1 costs $15.00.  
- Option 2 costs $9.00.  
- Therefore, Option 2 (packages of 2) is cheaper.

### Step 3: Calculate the savings.
- Savings = Cost of the more expensive option - Cost of the cheaper option  
- Savings = $15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00

Let M be the number of copies Marilyn sold.

According to the problem statement:
1. Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's.
   This can be written as an equation: M = 10 * H

2. They sold 88,000 copies combined.
   This means the sum of their sales is 88,000: M + H = 88,000

Now we have a system of two equations:
1) M = 10H
2) M + H = 88,000

Substitute the first equation (M = 10H) into the second equation:
(10H) + H = 88,000

Combine the terms with H:
11H = 88,000

To find H, divide both sides of the equation by 11:
H = 88,000 / 11
H = 8,000

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

To verify:
If Harald sold 8,000 copies, then Marilyn sold 10 * 8,000 = 80,000 copies.
Together, they sold 8,000 + 80,000 = 88,000 copies, which matches the problem statement.

gsm8k,gsm8k-119,TrustRoute,1,"To calculate the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later, let's break this down step by step based on the information provided.

### Step 1: Determine Lylah's salary four years ago
- Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
- Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's salary at that time.
- Let \( L_0 \) be Lylah's salary four years ago.
- Then, Adrien's salary = \( L_0 + 0.30 \times L_0 = 1.30 \times L_0 \).
- So, \( 40,000 = 1.30 \times L_0 \).
- Solving for \( L_0 \):
  \[
  L_0 = \frac{40,000}{1.30} = \frac{40,000}{1.3} \approx 30,769.23
  \]
- Therefore, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.

### Step 2: Determine Adrien's salary four years later
- Adrien's salary increased by 40% from four years ago.
- Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
- Adrien's new salary = \( 40,000 + 0.40 \times 40,000 = 1.40 \times 40,000 = 56,000 \).
- Therefore, Adrien's salary four years later is $56,000.

### Step 3: Determine Lylah's salary four years later
- The prompt states that both salaries increased simultaneously, but it does not specify the exact increase for Lylah.
- Based on the information, we can reasonably assume that Lylah's salary also increased by the same percentage as Adrien's, which is 40%, since they increased at the same time and no other details are provided.
- Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.
- Lylah's new salary = \( 30,769.23 \times 1.40 \approx 43,076.92 \).
- Therefore, Lylah's salary four years later is approximately $43,076.92.

### Step 4: Calculate the total salary four years later
- Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary.
- Total salary = \( 56,000 + 43,076.92 = 99,076.92 \).

### Final Answer
The total salary that Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later is approximately **$99,076.92**. (Salaries are typically rounded to two decimal places for currency.)",0.00817535,34.79495120048523,0,0,cand-grok-3-mini,stage2_confidence,

- Kelly runs back and forth once on the full 100-yard field, which is 200 yards.
- Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times.
- Running to the 40-yard line and back:  
  - From the starting point (e.g., the 0-yard line) to the 40-yard line is 40 yards.  
  - Back to the starting point is another 40 yards.  
  - So, one such trip is \( 40 + 40 = 80 \) yards.
- For 34 trips:  
  \( 34 \times 80 = 2720 \) yards.
- Kelly's total distance:  
  \( 200 + 2720 = 2920 \) yards.

### Step 3: Compare the distances
- Blake ran 3000 yards.
- Kelly ran 2920 yards.
- Blake ran farther, so Blake is the winner.
- The difference:  
  \( 3000 - 2920 = 80 \) yards.

### Final Answer
Blake, the winner, ran 80 yards farther than Kelly, the loser.",0.0057376499999999995,19.990232467651367,0,0,cand-grok-3-mini,stage2_vote,

### Step 1: Determine the depth on Tuesday
- On Monday, the depth was 17 feet.
- On Tuesday, the depth increased by 7 feet.
- So, Tuesday's depth = Monday's depth + 7 feet
- Tuesday's depth = 17 feet + 7 feet = 24 feet

### Step 2: Determine the depth on Wednesday
- On Wednesday, the depth is two thirds of Tuesday's depth.
- So, Wednesday's depth = (2/3) × Tuesday's depth
- Wednesday's depth = (2/3) × 24 feet
- First, multiply: 24 × 2 = 48

   \]

2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28:

We can simplify the second equation:
\[

\text{Total time for Team A} = 4 \times 55 = 220 \text{ seconds}
\]

**Team B (less well-rounded team):**
- The first runner runs in 60 seconds.
- The second runner runs 3 seconds faster than the first, so:
  \[
  \text{Time for 2nd runner} = 60 - 3 = 57 \text{ seconds}

- The third runner runs 3 seconds faster than the second, so:
  \[
  \text{Time for 3rd runner} = 57 - 3 = 54 \text{ seconds}

gsm8k,gsm8k-186,TrustRoute,1,"To solve the problem, we need to break down the distribution of straw among the different types of rodents: rats, hamsters, and rabbits.

1. **Rats**: 
   - Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage.
   - There are 3 cages of rats, so the total number of rats is \( 3r \).
   - Each rat receives 6 pieces of straw, so the total straw given to the rats is:
     \[
     \text{Straw for rats} = 3r \times 6 = 18r
     \]

2. **Hamsters**:
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster receives 5 pieces of straw.
   - Let \( h \) be the number of hamsters in each cage.
   - The total number of hamsters is \( 10h \).
   - The total straw given to the hamsters is:
     \[
     \text{Straw for hamsters} = 10h \times 5 = 50h
     \]

3. **Rabbits**:
   - The problem states that 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

4. **Total Straw Distributed**:
   - The total amount of straw distributed is given as 160 pieces. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     18r + 50h + 20 = 160
     \]

5. **Simplifying the Equation**:
   - Subtract 20 from both sides:
     \[
     18r + 50h = 140
     \]

6. **Finding Integer Solutions**:
   - We need to find integer values for \( r \) and \( h \) that satisfy this equation. We can express \( h \) in terms of \( r \):
     \[
     50h = 140 - 18r
     \]
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18r}{50}
     \]

   - For \( h \) to be an integer, \( 140 - 18r \) must be divisible by 50. We can check values of \( r \) to find suitable integers.

   - Testing \( r = 0 \):
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18 \times 0}{50} = \frac{140}{50} = 2.8 \quad \text{(not an integer)}

     h = \frac{140 - 18 \times 1}{50} = \frac{122}{50} = 2.44 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]

   - Testing \( r = 2 \):
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18 \times 2}{50} = \frac{104}{50} = 2.08 \quad \text{(not an integer)}

   - Testing \( r = 3 \):
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18 \times 3}{50} = \frac{86}{50} = 1.72 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]

   - Testing \( r = 4 \):
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18 \times 4}{50} = \frac{68}{50} = 1.36 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]

   - Testing \( r = 5 \):
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18 \times 5}{50} = \frac{50}{50} = 1 \quad \text{(integer)}
     \]

   - Testing \( r = 6 \):
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18 \times 6}{50} = \frac{32}{50} = 0.64 \quad \text{(not an integer)}

   - Testing \( r = 7 \):
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18 \times 7}{50} = \frac{14}{50} = 0.28 \quad \text{(not an integer)}

gsm8k,gsm8k-199,TrustRoute,1,"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the payment from Publisher A:**
   - Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers. Since he edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits:
     \[
     \text{Sentences for Publisher A} = \text{Sentences for Publisher B} = \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences}
     \]
   - Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, the payment from Publisher A is:
     \[
     \text{Payment from Publisher A} = 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents}
     \]

2. **Determine the payment from Publisher B:**
   - Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays. Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, Publisher B pays:
     \[
     \text{Payment per sentence from Publisher B} = 2 \times 5 \text{ cents} = 10 \text{ cents}
     \]
   - Therefore, the payment from Publisher B is:
     \[
     \text{Payment from Publisher B} = 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total payment for the week:**
   - The total payment Mark makes in a week is the sum of the payments from both publishers:
     \[
     \text{Total payment} = \text{Payment from Publisher A} + \text{Payment from Publisher B} = 2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents}
     \]

Thus, Mark makes a total of **7500 cents** in a week.",0.00230325,13.185461282730103,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,
