gsm8k,gsm8k-0,TrustRoute,1,"To find out how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market from selling her duck eggs, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of eggs laid per day**: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.

2. **Determine how many eggs she consumes**: Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs for baking muffins. Therefore, the total number of eggs she consumes daily is:
   \[
   3 \text{ (for breakfast)} + 4 \text{ (for muffins)} = 7 \text{ eggs}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of eggs remaining for sale**: To find out how many eggs are left after Janet consumes some, we subtract the number of eggs she eats from the total number of eggs laid:
   \[
   16 \text{ (total eggs)} - 7 \text{ (eggs consumed)} = 9 \text{ eggs remaining}
   \]

4. **Calculate the daily earnings from selling the eggs**: Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 per egg. Therefore, her earnings from selling the eggs are:

### Step 1: Initial Outbound Trip
- John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
- Distance covered: Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.
- So, at the end of this, John is 180 miles away from home.

### Step 2: Return Trip (4 Hours Total)
Now, John starts his return trip, aiming to get home in 4 hours. Let's analyze the segments of this trip:

- **First 2 hours:** Standstill traffic (speed = 0 mph).
  - Distance covered: 0 miles.
  - John remains 180 miles from home.

- **Next 0.5 hours (half-hour):** Driving at 30 mph.
  - Distance covered: Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
  - Since he's driving toward home, subtract this from the current distance: 180 miles - 15 miles = 165 miles from home.

- **Remaining time:** The total return trip is 4 hours, so after 2 hours (standstill) and 0.5 hours (at 30 mph), the time used is 2 + 0.5 = 2.5 hours.
  - Remaining time: 4 hours - 2.5 hours = 1.5 hours.
  - He drives at 80 mph for this 1.5 hours.
  - Distance covered: Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.
  - Subtract this from the current distance: 165 miles - 120 miles = 45 miles from home.

   - So, second month downloads = \( 3 \times 60 = 180 \).

3. **Third Month Downloads**: 
   - The downloads in the third month were reduced by 30% from the second month.

- Average speed = Total distance / Total time
- Desired average speed = 4 miles per hour
- Total distance = 12 miles

Total time required = Total distance / Average speed

- Darrell's age = 7x
- Allen's age = 11x

where x is a common multiplier.

**Step 2: Use the total age to find x**

Their total age is 162, so:

1. **Calculate the weight of the comic books removed:**
   - Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound (0.25 pounds).

**Given information:**
- Bridge weight limit: 5000 pounds
- Weight of each box: 15 pounds
- Weight of driver + empty truck: 3755 pounds

**Step-by-step solution:**

1) First, I'll find how much weight capacity is available for boxes:
   - Available capacity = Bridge limit - (Driver + Empty truck)
   - Available capacity = 5000 - 3755
   - Available capacity = 1245 pounds

2) Now I'll find the maximum number of boxes:
   - Number of boxes = Available capacity ÷ Weight per box
   - Number of boxes = 1245 ÷ 15
   - Number of boxes = 83

3) Let me verify this answer:
   - Total weight = 3755 + (83 × 15)

1.  **Find Lee's time:**
    Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.

2.  **Find Gerald's original time:**
    The problem states that Lee used to be able to run two seconds faster than Gerald. This means Gerald's original time was 2 seconds slower than Lee's time.
    Gerald's original time = Lee's time + 2 seconds
    Gerald's original time = 38 seconds + 2 seconds = 40 seconds.

3.  **Calculate Gerald's improved time:**
    Gerald improved his speed by 10%. An improvement in speed means his time will decrease. If speed increases by 10%, the new speed is 110% of the old speed. Since time is inversely proportional to speed (for a fixed distance), the new time will be the old time divided by 1.10 (or multiplied by 1/1.10).

    Gerald's improved time = Gerald's original time / 1.10
    Gerald's improved time = 40 seconds / 1.10

gsm8k,gsm8k-110,TrustRoute,1,"To find out how many fruit roll-ups Marcell and Beatrice ate on average, we first need to calculate the total number of roll-ups each of them had.

**Beatrice's roll-ups:**
- Width: 2 roll-ups
- Length: 24 roll-ups

Total roll-ups for Beatrice:
\[
\text{Total for Beatrice} = \text{Width} \times \text{Length} = 2 \times 24 = 48
\]

**Marcell's roll-ups:**
- Width: 3 roll-ups
- Length: 14 roll-ups

Total roll-ups for Marcell:
\[
\text{Total for Marcell} = \text{Width} \times \text{Length} = 3 \times 14 = 42
\]

Now, we can find the total number of roll-ups eaten by both:
\[
\text{Total roll-ups} = \text{Total for Beatrice} + \text{Total for Marcell} = 48 + 42 = 90
\]

Next, we find the average number of roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice:
\[

1. **Calculate Julia's rowing speed**:
   - Julia rows 20 feet in 16 seconds.
   - Her speed is:
     \[
     \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second}

2. **Calculate the total distance to shore**:
   - Julia has 64 seconds to reach the shore.
   - The distance she can cover in that time is:
     \[
     \text{Distance to shore} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 80 \text{ feet}

First, we can determine the total number of parts in the ratio:

\[
7 + 13 = 20 \text{ parts}

Next, we know that the total amount of sugar and water combined is 120 teaspoons. We can set up an equation to find out how much one part is worth:

gsm8k,gsm8k-119,TrustRoute,1,"Here's a step-by-step calculation:

**1. Calculate Lylah's salary four years ago:**
Let Adrien's salary four years ago be $A_0 = \$40,000$.
Let Lylah's salary four years ago be $L_0$.
We are told Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's:
$A_0 = L_0 + 0.30 \times L_0$
$A_0 = L_0 \times (1 + 0.30)$
$A_0 = L_0 \times 1.30$
$\$40,000 = L_0 \times 1.30$
$L_0 = \frac{\$40,000}{1.30}$
$L_0 \approx \$30,769.23$

**2. Calculate Adrien's salary four years later:**
Let Adrien's salary four years later be $A_1$.
His salary increased by 40% from what it was four years ago:
$A_1 = A_0 + 0.40 \times A_0$
$A_1 = A_0 \times (1 + 0.40)$
$A_1 = \$40,000 \times 1.40$
$A_1 = \$56,000$

**3. Calculate Lylah's salary four years later:**
The problem states ""Adrien's and Lylah's salary increased simultaneously"". When no specific percentage increase is given for Lylah, and considering the initial relative difference, the most common interpretation in such problems is that either:
    a) Lylah's salary also increased by the same percentage as Adrien's (40%).
    b) The relative difference (Adrien earning 30% more than Lylah) was maintained.

Both interpretations lead to the same result for Lylah's current salary. If Lylah's salary increases by 40%, and Adrien's salary also increases by 40%, then their relative salary difference will be maintained.
So, Lylah's salary four years later ($L_1$) would be:
$L_1 = L_0 \times (1 + 0.40)$
$L_1 = \left(\frac{\$40,000}{1.30}\right) \times 1.40$
$L_1 = \frac{\$56,000}{1.30}$
$L_1 \approx \$43,076.92$

**4. Calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later:**
Total salary later = Adrien's current salary + Lylah's current salary
Total salary later = $A_1 + L_1$
Total salary later = $\$56,000 + \$43,076.923076...$
Total salary later $\approx \$99,076.92$

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of each item type**
- 2 subs at $7.50 each: 2 × $7.50 = $15.00
- 2 bags of chips at $1.50 each: 2 × $1.50 = $3.00
- 2 cookies at $1.00 each: 2 × $1.00 = $2.00

Let me define variables:
- Let q = number of queen bees
- Let b = number of baby bees
- Let w = number of worker bees

Now I'll set up equations based on the given information:

1. Total bees: q + b + w = 700
2. ""Twice as many worker bees as baby bees"": w = 2b
3. ""Twice as many babies as queens"": b = 2q

Now I'll solve by substitution:

From equation 3: b = 2q
From equation 2: w = 2b = 2(2q) = 4q

Substituting into equation 1:
q + 2q + 4q = 700
7q = 700
q = 100

Therefore:
- Queens: q = 100
- Baby bees: b = 2q = 2(100) = 200

- Shawnda charges 25 cents per tire.
- Bicycles have 2 tires each.
- Tricycles have 3 tires each.
- Unicycles have 1 tire.

### Step 2: Calculate the total tires inflated
- 5 people on bicycles: Each bicycle has 2 tires, so 5 bicycles × 2 tires = 10 tires.
- 3 people on tricycles: Each tricycle has 3 tires, so 3 tricycles × 3 tires = 9 tires.
- 1 person on a unicycle: It has 1 tire, so 1 unicycle × 1 tire = 1 tire.
- Total tires inflated: 10 (bicycles) + 9 (tricycles) + 1 (unicycle) = 20 tires.

1. **Total Budget**: €1500
2. **Cost of the computer**: €1090
3. **Cost of the scanner**: €157
4. **Cost of the CD burner**: €74
5. **Cost of the printer**: €102

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the computer and accessories:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost of computer} + \text{Cost of scanner} + \text{Cost of CD burner} + \text{Cost of printer}

   \text{Straw for hamsters} = 10 \text{ cages} \times h \text{ hamsters/cage} \times 5 \text{ pieces of straw/hamster} = 50h
   \]

3. **Calculate the straw used for rabbits**: The problem states that 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

4. **Calculate the straw used for rats**: Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage. There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat receives 6 pieces of straw. The total straw used for rats is:
   \[
   \text{Straw for rats} = 3 \text{ cages} \times r \text{ rats/cage} \times 6 \text{ pieces of straw/rat} = 18r
   \]

5. **Set up the equation**: The total straw distributed is the sum of the straw used for hamsters, rabbits, and rats:
   \[
   50h + 20 + 18r = 160
   \]

6. **Simplify the equation**: Subtract 20 from both sides:
   \[
   50h + 18r = 140
   \]

7. **Express \( h \) in terms of \( r \)**: Rearranging gives:
   \[
   50h = 140 - 18r \quad \Rightarrow \quad h = \frac{140 - 18r}{50}
   \]

8. **Determine possible values for \( r \)**: Since \( h \) must be a whole number, \( 140 - 18r \) must be divisible by 50. We can test integer values for \( r \):

   - For \( r = 0 \):
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18(0)}{50} = \frac{140}{50} = 2.8 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]
   - For \( r = 1 \):
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18(1)}{50} = \frac{122}{50} = 2.44 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]
   - For \( r = 2 \):
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18(2)}{50} = \frac{104}{50} = 2.08 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]
   - For \( r = 3 \):
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18(3)}{50} = \frac{86}{50} = 1.72 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]
   - For \( r = 4 \):
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18(4)}{50} = \frac{68}{50} = 1.36 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]
   - For \( r = 5 \):
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18(5)}{50} = \frac{50}{50} = 1 \quad \text{(an integer)}
     \]

9. **Conclusion**: When \( r = 5 \), \( h = 1 \). Thus, there are 5 rats in each cage.

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is \( \boxed{5} \).",0.0029710500000000003,21.973868131637573,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,
gsm8k,gsm8k-187,TrustRoute,1,"To calculate how much Mandy should pay Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can use the formula for compound interest:

\[
A = P(1 + r)^n
\]

Where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n months, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (as a decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of months the money is borrowed.

Given:
- \( P = 100 \) (the amount owed)
- \( r = 0.02 \) (2% interest rate)
- \( n = 3 \) (the number of months)

Now, we can plug in the values:

\[
A = 100(1 + 0.02)^3
\]

Calculating \( (1 + 0.02)^3 \):

\[
(1 + 0.02)^3 = (1.02)^3 \approx 1.061208

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of bags of wheat.

2. **Calculate Costs**:
   - The cost price per bag is $20.
   - The transportation cost per bag is $2.
   - Therefore, the total cost per bag is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost per bag} = 20 + 2 = 22 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The total cost for \( x \) bags is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 22x
     \]

3. **Calculate Revenue**:
   - The selling price per bag is $30.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from selling \( x \) bags is:
     \[
     \text{Total revenue} = 30x
     \]

4. **Calculate Profit**:
   - Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost}
     \]
   - Substituting the expressions we found:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = 30x - 22x = 8x
     \]

5. **Set Up the Profit Equation**:
   - We know the total profit is $400:
     \[
     8x = 400
     \]

6. **Solve for \( x \)**:
