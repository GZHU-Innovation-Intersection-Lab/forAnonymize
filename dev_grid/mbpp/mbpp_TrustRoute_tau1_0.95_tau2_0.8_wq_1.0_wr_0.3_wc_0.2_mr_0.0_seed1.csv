mbpp,Mbpp/235,TrustRoute,1,"The problem statement asks to ""set all even bits"" of a given number. In standard bit manipulation, ""even bits"" refers to bits at even positions (0-indexed from the right, i.e., positions 0, 2, 4, etc.). ""Setting a bit"" means ensuring its value is 1. If it's already 1, it remains 1; if it's 0, it becomes 1. This operation is achieved by a bitwise OR with a mask that has 1s at all even bit positions and 0s at odd bit positions.

For example, a mask with all even bits set up to 64 bits would be `0x5555555555555555` (binary `01010101...0101`).

However, the provided assertion `assert even_bit_set_number(10) == 10` contradicts this standard interpretation.
Let's analyze `num = 10` (binary `0b1010`):
- Bit 0 (even position): `0`
- Bit 1 (odd position): `1`
- Bit 2 (even position): `0`
- Bit 3 (odd position): `1`
- Other even bits (4, 6, ...) are `0`.

If we ""set all even bits"" by performing a bitwise OR with `0x5555555555555555`:
`0b...00001010` (10)
`| 0b...01010101` (0x55...5)
--------------------
`0b...01011111` (which is `0x555555555555555F` for 64 bits, or 95 for 8 bits).
This result is clearly not 10.

Given this contradiction, there are two possible interpretations:
1.  **Strictly follow the textual instruction:** Implement the standard ""set all even bits"" operation (`num | MASK`). This solution will fail the provided `assert` if the assert is part of a test suite.
2.  **Strictly follow the example assertion:** Implement a function that returns 10 when given 10. The only generic function that does this and could plausibly be associated with ""bits"" in a very misleading way is `return num`. This would completely ignore the ""set all even bits"" instruction.

As an AI assistant, my primary goal is to provide a correct and executable solution that adheres to the explicit prompt. When a textual description contradicts a specific example, the example often serves as the ground truth for the *expected behavior*. However, the textual description here describes a very specific, common bitwise operation.

I will provide the solution that implements the **literal meaning of ""setting all even bits""**, as this is the standard interpretation of the phrase. If the provided assertion fails, it suggests the assertion itself or the problem's phrasing is incorrect relative to standard bitwise operations.
