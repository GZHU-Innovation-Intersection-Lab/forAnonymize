humaneval,HumanEval/119,Oracle,1,"Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Check if concatenating the two strings in either order results in balanced parentheses
2. A balanced string has matching open and close parentheses in the correct order

Let me think through the approach:
- There are only 2 possible concatenations: `lst[0] + lst[1]` or `lst[1] + lst[0]`
- For each concatenation, I need to check if parentheses are balanced
- To check balance: count should never go negative (no close before open), and should end at 0 (equal opens and closes)

Here's my solution:

```python
def match_parens(lst):
    '''
    You are given a list of two strings, both strings consist of open
    parentheses '(' or close parentheses ')' only.
    Your job is to check if it is possible to concatenate the two strings in
    some order, that the resulting string will be good.
    A string S is considered to be good if and only if all parentheses in S
    are balanced. For example: the string '(())()' is good, while the string
    '())' is not.
    Return 'Yes' if there's a way to make a good string, and return 'No' otherwise.

    Examples:
    match_parens(['()(', ')']) == 'Yes'
    match_parens([')', ')']) == 'No'
    '''
    
    def is_balanced(s):
        """"""Check if a string of parentheses is balanced""""""
        count = 0
        for char in s:
            if char == '(':
                count += 1
            else:  # char == ')'
                count -= 1
            # If count goes negative, we have more closes than opens so far
            if count < 0:
                return False
        # At the end, count should be 0 (equal opens and closes)

    if is_balanced(lst[1] + lst[0]):
        return 'Yes'
    
    return 'No'
```

**How it works:**

1. `is_balanced(s)`: Checks if a string has balanced parentheses by:
   - Incrementing count for '(' and decrementing for ')'
   - Returning False if count ever goes negative (more closes than opens)
   - Returning True only if final count is 0 (equal opens and closes)

2. Main function tries both concatenation orders and returns 'Yes' if either is balanced

**Testing with examples:**
- `match_parens(['()(', ')'])`: 
  - `'()(' + ')' = '()()'` → balanced ✓ → Returns 'Yes'
- `match_parens([')', ')'])`:
  - `')' + ')' = '))'` → not balanced (count goes negative immediately)

Wait, the expected output is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. Let me reconsider...

Actually, looking at the expected output `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, it seems like when counts are equal, we sort by decimal value. Let me recheck:
- 1 (1 bit), 2 (1 bit), 4 (1 bit), 3 (2 bits), 5 (2 bits)
- Result: [1, 2, 4, 3, 5] ❌

Hmm, that doesn't match. Let me check if the secondary sort should also be ascending:
- Grouping by bit count: {1: [1,2,4], 2: [3,5]}
- Sorting each group: {1: [1,2,4], 2: [3,5]}
- Result: [1,2,4,3,5] - still doesn't match [1,2,3,4,5]

Wait! Maybe I need to use a stable sort or the secondary sort key is also considered in the primary sort. Let me use a tuple as sort key: (bit_count, decimal_value)

Here's the solution:

```python
def sort_array(arr):
    """"""

    # Sort by: (number of 1s in binary, then by decimal value)
    return sorted(arr, key=lambda x: (count_ones(x), x))
```

**Test cases:**
```python
# Test 1
print(sort_array([1, 5, 2, 3, 4]))  # [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]
# 1=1bit, 2=1bit, 4=1bit, 3=2bits, 5=2bits

# Test 2  
print(sort_array([-2, -3, -4, -5, -6]))  # [-6, -5, -4, -3, -2]

# 0=0bits, 1=1bit, 2=1bit, 4=1bit, 3=2bits

- OR check if all consecutive pairs are non-increasing (decreasing or equal)

    """"""Return True is list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing.

    decreasing = all(l[i] >= l[i + 1] for i in range(len(l) - 1))

**How it works:**
- Handle edge case: lists with 0 or 1 elements are monotonic by definition
- `increasing`: checks if each element is ≤ the next (allows equal values)
- `decreasing`: checks if each element is ≥ the next (allows equal values)
- Return `True` if either condition holds

**Test cases:**

1. The list `q` is palindromic (balanced)

Both conditions must be true for the object to fly.

Let me trace through the examples:
- `[1, 2], 5`: Not palindromic (1,2 ≠ 2,1), sum=3≤5 ✓, but unbalanced → False
- `[3, 2, 3], 1`: Palindromic ✓, sum=8>1 ✗ → False  
- `[3, 2, 3], 9`: Palindromic ✓, sum=8≤9 ✓ → True
- `[3], 5`: Palindromic ✓, sum=3≤5 ✓ → True

```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    '''
    Write a function that returns True if the object q will fly, and False otherwise.
    The object q will fly if it's balanced (it is a palindromic list) and the sum of its elements is less than or equal the maximum possible weight w.

    Example:
    will_it_fly([1, 2], 5) ➞ False 
    # 1+2 is less than the maximum possible weight, but it's unbalanced.

    will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1) ➞ False
    # it's balanced, but 3+2+3 is more than the maximum possible weight.

    will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9) ➞ True
    # 3+2+3 is less than the maximum possible weight, and it's balanced.

    will_it_fly([3], 5) ➞ True

    is_light_enough = sum(q) <= w
    
    # Both conditions must be true
    return is_balanced and is_light_enough

- Uses `q[::-1]` to reverse the list and compare it with the original to check if it's palindromic
- Uses `sum(q)` to calculate the total weight

1. `min_ending_here`: tracks the minimum sum of subarrays ending at the current position

At each position, we decide whether to:
- Start a new subarray from the current element (`nums[i]`)
- Extend the previous subarray (`min_ending_here + nums[i]`)

- tri(n) = 1 + n/2, if n is even
- tri(n) = tri(n-1) + tri(n-2) + tri(n+1), if n is odd

The tricky part is that for odd n, we need tri(n+1) to calculate tri(n). But if n+1 is even, we can calculate it directly using the formula.

Let me trace through the example:
- tri(0) = 1 + 0/2 = 1 (even case)

```

**How it works:**

1. **Handle 2 separately**: First, we divide by 2 as many times as possible. This is efficient because 2 is the only even prime.

2. **Check odd divisors**: Starting from 3, we check only odd numbers (incrementing by 2) since even numbers can't be prime factors after removing all 2s.

3. **Optimization**: We only check divisors up to √n because if n has a factor greater than √n, it must also have a corresponding factor less than √n.

4. **Remaining prime**: If n is still greater than 1 after the loop, it means n itself is a prime factor.

**Time Complexity**: O(√n)

humaneval,HumanEval/24,Oracle,1,"Looking at this problem, I need to find the largest divisor of `n` that is smaller than `n` itself.

Let me think step by step:
1. The largest divisor of `n` (excluding `n` itself) will be found by dividing `n` by its smallest prime factor
2. I can iterate from 2 upwards to find the smallest divisor, then return `n` divided by that divisor
3. Alternatively, I can iterate downwards from `n-1` to find the largest divisor directly

The most efficient approach is to find the smallest divisor > 1, then return `n` divided by it:

```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    """""" For a given number n, find the largest number that divides n evenly, smaller than n
    >>> largest_divisor(15)

    """"""

        if n % i == 0:
            return n // i
    # If no divisor found, n is prime, so largest divisor is 1
    return 1
```

**How it works:**
- We iterate from 2 to √n to find the smallest divisor
- When we find a divisor `i`, we return `n // i` (which is the largest divisor)
- We only need to check up to √n because divisors come in pairs: if `i` divides `n`, then `n/i` also divides `n`
- If no divisor is found, `n` is prime, so the largest divisor smaller than `n` is 1

**Example:** 
- `largest_divisor(15)`: smallest divisor is 3, so return 15//3 = 5 ✓
- `largest_divisor(12)`: smallest divisor is 2, so return 12//2 = 6

Let me trace through the examples:
- `{""a"":""apple"", ""b"":""banana""}` - all lowercase → True
- `{""a"":""apple"", ""A"":""banana"", ""B"":""banana""}` - mixed lower/upper → False
- `{""a"":""apple"", 8:""banana"", ""a"":""apple""}` - has non-string key (8) → False

**Explanation:**

1. **Validation**: First, I check if the three sides form a valid triangle using the triangle inequality theorem - the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.

2. **Edge cases**: I also check for non-positive side lengths.

3. **Heron's Formula**: To calculate the area, I use Heron's formula:
   - Calculate the semi-perimeter: `s = (a + b + c) / 2`
   - Calculate the area: `area = √(s × (s-a) × (s-b) × (s-c))`

humaneval,HumanEval/62,Oracle,1,"Looking at this problem, I need to find the derivative of a polynomial given its coefficients.

Let me think step by step:
- If `xs[i]` is the coefficient of `x^i`, then the derivative of `x^i` is `i * x^(i-1)`
- So the coefficient `xs[i]` becomes `i * xs[i]` in the derivative, and it's now the coefficient of `x^(i-1)`

For example:
- `xs[0]` (constant term) → derivative is 0, so it disappears
- `xs[1] * x` → derivative is `1 * xs[1]` (constant term in result)
- `xs[2] * x^2` → derivative is `2 * xs[2] * x` (coefficient of x in result)
- `xs[i] * x^i` → derivative is `i * xs[i] * x^(i-1)`

So the result will have one fewer term, and each coefficient at index `i` in the result comes from `(i+1) * xs[i+1]`.

**How it works:**
- Convert integer to string to easily manipulate digits
- If `shift > n`, return reversed string
- For circular right shift: take the last `shift` characters and concatenate with the remaining front part
- Use modulo to handle cases where shift equals the length (full rotation)

**Test cases:**
```python
print(circular_shift(12, 1))    # ""21""
print(circular_shift(12, 2))    # ""12""
print(circular_shift(123, 1))   # ""312""
print(circular_shift(123, 2))   # ""231""
print(circular_shift(123, 5))   # ""321"" (reversed, since 5 > 3)

**How it works:**
1. We iterate through indices from 0 to `len(string) - 1`
2. For each index `i`, we slice the string from the beginning up to and including position `i` using `string[:i+1]`
3. This creates prefixes of increasing length: first character, first two characters, etc.

```python
all_prefixes('abc')   # ['a', 'ab', 'abc']
all_prefixes('hello') # ['h', 'he', 'hel', 'hell', 'hello']
all_prefixes('')      # []

  - Testing divisibility by odd numbers from 3 up to √num
- Iterate through all numbers from 2 to n-1 and collect the prime ones

**Key points:**

1. **`isinstance(value, int)`** - Checks if the value is an integer

**Why exclude booleans?**
In Python, `isinstance(True, int)` returns `True` because `bool` inherits from `int`. The additional check ensures we filter out boolean values and keep only genuine integers.

**How it works:**

1. Initialize a counter to 0
2. Iterate through each number in the array
3. Check if the number is greater than 10
4. Convert the number to a string to easily access first and last digits
5. Check if both the first digit and last digit are odd (remainder 1 when divided by 2)
6. If all conditions are met, increment the counter
7. Return the final count

- `15`: > 10 ✓, first digit 1 (odd) ✓, last digit 5 (odd) ✓ → counts

humaneval,HumanEval/110,Oracle,1,"Looking at this problem, I need to determine if I can exchange elements between two lists to make `lst1` contain only even numbers.

Let me think through the logic:

1. For `lst1` to contain only even numbers, I need exactly `len(lst1)` even numbers total
2. I can exchange any elements between the lists, so what matters is the **total count of even numbers** across both lists
3. If the total number of even numbers in both lists combined is at least `len(lst1)`, then I can move enough even numbers into `lst1`

Let me trace through the examples:
- `exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4])`: 
  - lst1 has 2 even numbers (2, 4)
  - lst2 has 2 even numbers (2, 4)
  - Total: 4 even numbers, need 4 for lst1 → YES ✓

- `exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4])`:
  - lst1 has 2 even numbers (2, 4)
  - lst2 has 2 even numbers (2, 4)
  - Total: 4 even numbers, need 4 for lst1 → Should be YES
  - But expected output is NO... let me reconsider

Wait, I need to re-read the problem. After exchange, `lst1` should have only even numbers, but `lst1` must still have the same length. So I need at least `len(lst1)` even numbers total across both lists.

Actually, looking at the second example again: both lists have 4 elements, and there are 4 even numbers total. But the answer is NO. Let me reconsider...

Oh! I see - in the second example, `lst2 = [1, 5, 3, 4]` has only 1 even number (4), not 2. Let me recount:
- lst1: [1, 2, 3, 4] → even: 2, 4 (count = 2)
- lst2: [1, 5, 3, 4] → even: 4 (count = 1)
- Total: 3 even numbers, need 4 → NO ✓

**How it works:**

1. **`is_palindrome(num)`**: Helper function that converts the number to a string and checks if it reads the same forwards and backwards using string slicing `[::-1]`

2. **Main loop**: Iterate through all numbers from 1 to n (inclusive)
   - Check if the number is a palindrome
   - If it is, check if it's even (divisible by 2) or odd
   - Increment the appropriate counter

3. **Return**: A tuple with (even_count, odd_count)

**Testing with the examples:**

Let me think through the approach:

1. **Edge cases:**
   - If `n == 1`: Only `1**k = 1` for any k, so return `True` only if `x == 1`
   - If `n == 0`: Only `0**k = 0` for k > 0, so return `True` only if `x == 0`
   - If `x == 1`: Any `n**0 = 1`, so return `True` (except when n=0)
   - If `n == -1`: Powers alternate between -1 and 1, so check if `x` is 1 or -1

2. **General case:**

1. Calculate the sum of digits for each number (handling negative numbers correctly)
2. Sort by digit sum, preserving original order for equal sums (stable sort)
3. Return the sorted list

Key consideration: For negative numbers, the negative sign applies to the entire number, but we need to handle the digit sum carefully. Based on the example, `-1` has digit sum `-1`, and `-11` has digit sum `-2` (i.e., `-(1+1)`).

Let me trace through the example:
- `1`: digit sum = 1
- `11`: digit sum = 1+1 = 2
- `-1`: digit sum = -1
- `-11`: digit sum = -(1+1) = -2
- `-12`: digit sum = -(1+2) = -3

Sorted by digit sum: `-12` (-3), `-11` (-2), `-1` (-1), `1` (1), `11` (2)

Wait, but the expected output is `[-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]`. Let me reconsider...

Actually, looking more carefully at the expected output, it seems like for negative numbers, only the first digit is negative:
- `-1`: -1
- `-11`: -1 + 1 = 0
- `-12`: -1 + 2 = 1

Let me verify: `[-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]`
- `-1`: -1
- `-11`: 0
- `1`: 1
- `-12`: 1 (same as `1`, so preserve original order)
- `11`: 2

This matches! So for negative numbers, only the leftmost digit is negative.

humaneval,HumanEval/129,Oracle,1,"Looking at this problem, I need to find the lexicographically smallest path of length k in a grid.

Let me think through the approach:

1. To get the lexicographically smallest path, I should start with the smallest value possible at each step
2. At each position in the path, I want to choose the smallest available neighbor
3. The key insight: Since we want the lexicographically smallest path, we should:
   - Start from the cell with value 1 (the global minimum)
   - At each step, move to the neighbor with the smallest value
   - We can revisit cells, so we can alternate between cells if needed

Let me trace through the first example:
- Grid: [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]], k=3
- Start at cell with value 1 (position 0,0)
- Neighbors of 1: 2 (right) and 4 (down). Min = 2
- From 2, neighbors: 1 (left), 3 (right), 5 (down). Min = 1
- Path: [1, 2, 1] ✓

The strategy:
1. Find the position of the minimum value in the grid (which is 1)
2. From any position, find the minimum value among its neighbors
3. Build the path by always choosing the minimum neighbor at each step

```python
def minPath(grid, k):
    n = len(grid)
    
    # Find the position of the minimum value (which is 1)
    min_val = float('inf')
    min_pos = (0, 0)
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if grid[i][j] < min_val:
                min_val = grid[i][j]
                min_pos = (i, j)
    
    # Helper function to get neighbors
    def get_neighbors(i, j):
        neighbors = []
        directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
        for di, dj in directions:
            ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
            if 0 <= ni < n and 0 <= nj < n:
                neighbors.append((ni, nj))
        return neighbors
    
    # Find minimum neighbor value for any position
    def min_neighbor_value(i, j):
        neighbors = get_neighbors(i, j)
        return min(grid[ni][nj] for ni, nj in neighbors)
    
    # Build the path
    path = []
    current_pos = min_pos
    
    for step in range(k):
        path.append(grid[current_pos[0]][current_pos[1]])
        
        if step < k - 1:  # If not the last step
            # Find the neighbor with minimum value
            neighbors = get_neighbors(current_pos[0], current_pos[1])
            min_neighbor = min(neighbors, key=lambda pos: grid[pos[0]][pos[1]])
            current_pos = min_neighbor
    
    return path
```

Wait, let me reconsider. The path should always start from 1 and then alternate with its minimum neighbor. Let me simplify:

    n = len(grid)
    
    # Find minimum value among all neighbors of all cells
    min_neighbor = float('inf')

- For `a = 0`: directly return `True` (0 is 0³)
- For positive/negative numbers: take absolute value, find cube root, round to nearest integer
- Verify by cubing the result and checking if it equals the original absolute value

   - For n=2: 10 to 99 (90 numbers)
   - For n=3: 100 to 999 (900 numbers)

2. **Count numbers that start with 1**: 
   - First digit is 1, remaining (n-1) digits can be anything (0-9)
   - Count = 10^(n-1)

3. **Count numbers that end with 1**:
   - Last digit is 1, first digit can be 1-9 (not 0), middle (n-2) digits can be 0-9
   - Count = 9 × 10^(n-2)

4. **Count numbers that both start AND end with 1** (to avoid double counting):
   - First digit is 1, last digit is 1, middle (n-2) digits can be 0-9
   - Count = 10^(n-2)

5. **Using inclusion-exclusion principle**:
   - Total = (start with 1) + (end with 1) - (both start and end with 1)
   - Total = 10^(n-1) + 9 × 10^(n-2) - 10^(n-2)
   - Total = 10^(n-1) + 8 × 10^(n-2)

Let me verify with n=1:
- Numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Start or end with 1: just ""1""
- Formula: 10^0 + 8 × 10^(-1) = 1 + 0.8 = 1.8 ❌

For n=1, it's a special case since start and end are the same digit:
- Only ""1"" satisfies the condition
- Count = 1

Let me reconsider for n=2:
- Start with 1: 10-19 (10 numbers)
- End with 1: 11, 21, 31, 41, 51, 61, 71, 81, 91 (9 numbers)

## Understanding the Problem

1. Create an array `a` where `a[i] = i * i - i + 1` for i from 1 to n
2. Find all triples (a[i], a[j], a[k]) where i < j < k
3. Count triples where the sum is divisible by 3

## Key Insight

Instead of checking all possible triples (O(n³)), we can use modular arithmetic:
- A sum is divisible by 3 if `(a[i] + a[j] + a[k]) % 3 == 0`
- We only need to track `a[i] % 3` for each element
- Count elements with remainder 0, 1, and 2 when divided by 3

## Solution

def get_max_triples(n):
    """"""

    and a[i] + a[j] + a[k] is a multiple of 3.
    """"""
    # Create array a
    a = [i * i - i + 1 for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    
    # Count elements by their remainder when divided by 3
    count = [0, 0, 0]  # count[0] = remainder 0, count[1] = remainder 1, count[2] = remainder 2
    
    for val in a:
        count[val % 3] += 1
    
    # Count valid triples
    result = 0
    
    # Case 1: All three numbers have remainder 0
    # Choose 3 from count[0]
    result += count[0] * (count[0] - 1) * (count[0] - 2) // 6
    
    # Case 2: All three numbers have remainder 1
    # Choose 3 from count[1]
    result += count[1] * (count[1] - 1) * (count[1] - 2) // 6
    
    # Case 3: All three numbers have remainder 2
    # Choose 3 from count[2]
    result += count[2] * (count[2] - 1) * (count[2] - 2) // 6
    
    # Case 4: One number with each remainder (0, 1, 2)
    # Choose 1 from each group
    result += count[0] * count[1] * count[2]
    
    return result
```

## Explanation

The sum of three numbers is divisible by 3 if:
1. All three have remainder 0 (mod 3)
2. All three have remainder 1 (mod 3)
3. All three have remainder 2 (mod 3)
4. One has remainder 0, one has remainder 1, one has remainder 2 (mod 3)

For cases 1-3, we use combinations: C(n, 3) = n × (n-1) × (n-2) / 6

For case 4, we multiply the counts since we pick one from each group.

## Test with Example

```python
# Test
print(get_max_triples(5))  # Expected: 1

# Verify:
# a = [1, 3, 7, 13, 21]
# a % 3 = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]
# count = [2, 3, 0]
# Result = 0 + 0 + 0 + 2*3*0 = 0... 

# Let me recalculate manually:
# 1%3=1, 3%3=0, 7%3=1, 13%3=1, 21%3=0
# Triples: (1,7,13) -> 1+1+1=3 ✓

- When `x = min`: `(min - min) / (max - min) = 0`

4. Otherwise: keep the value unchanged
5. Return the sum of all processed values

Let me trace through the examples to understand the logic:

**Example 1: `[1,2,3]`**
- Index 0: multiple of both 3 and 4 → 1² = 1 (seems to square)
- Index 1: not multiple of 3 or 4 → 2
- Index 2: not multiple of 3 or 4 → 3

- Index 1: not multiple of 3 or 4 → -5
- Index 2: not multiple of 3 or 4 → 2
- Index 3: multiple of 3 only → (-1)² = 1
- Index 4: multiple of 4 only → (-5)³ = -125

    change the entries in the list whose indexes are not a multiple of 3 or 4. The function shall then return the sum of all entries.

            # Not a multiple of 3 or 4
            total += lst[i]

humaneval,HumanEval/132,Oracle,1,"Looking at this problem, I need to find if there's a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket is nested (i.e., depth ≥ 2).

Let me think step by step:
1. A valid subsequence means I can select some brackets that form a valid bracket sequence
2. ""Nested"" means at least one bracket must be inside another (depth ≥ 2)
3. The key insight: if the original string has any valid nested structure, I should be able to find it

Let me analyze the examples:
- `[[]]` - depth reaches 2, has nesting ✓
- `[]]]]]]][[[[[]` - no valid nested subsequence ✗
- `[][]` - only depth 1, no nesting ✗
- `[]` - only depth 1, no nesting ✗
- `[[][]]` - depth reaches 2, has nesting ✓
- `[[]][[` - has `[[]]` which is nested ✓

Strategy: I'll track the maximum depth we can achieve with a valid bracket sequence. If we can reach depth ≥ 2, there's nesting.

```python
def is_nested(string):
    '''
    Create a function that takes a string as input which contains only square brackets.
    The function should return True if and only if there is a valid subsequence of brackets 
    where at least one bracket in the subsequence is nested.

    # Track opening brackets and check if we can achieve depth >= 2
    max_depth = 0
    current_depth = 0
    
    for char in string:
        if char == '[':
            current_depth += 1
            max_depth = max(max_depth, current_depth)
        elif char == ']':
            if current_depth > 0:
                current_depth -= 1
    
    # If max_depth >= 2, we had nesting
    if max_depth >= 2:
        return True
    
    return False
```

Wait, this approach is too simple. Let me reconsider with `[]]]]]]][[[[[]`:
- This would give max_depth of 5, but the example says it should return False
- The issue is that we need a VALID subsequence, not just any sequence

Let me reconsider: we need to find if there exists a valid (balanced) subsequence with nesting.

Better approach: Check if we can form a valid nested bracket sequence by trying to match brackets properly.

```python
def is_nested(string):
    '''
    Create a function that takes a string as input which contains only square brackets.
    The function should return True if and only if there is a valid subsequence of brackets 
    where at least one bracket in the subsequence is nested.
    '''
    # Count consecutive opening and closing brackets
    # If we have at least 2 opening brackets before their matching closing brackets,
    # we have nesting
    
    opening_count = 0
    max_depth = 0
    
    for char in string:
        if char == '[':
            opening_count += 1
        elif char == ']' and opening_count > 0:
            max_depth = max(max_depth, opening_count)
            opening_count -= 1
    
    return max_depth >= 2
```

Let me verify with `[]]]]]]][[[[[]`:
- `[`: opening=1
- `]`: max_depth=1, opening=0
- `]]]]]]]`: opening=0, no matches
- `[[[[[`: opening=5
- `]`: max_depth=5, opening=4

This still gives True, but should be False. The issue is we need the closing brackets to come AFTER enough opening brackets.

Actually, rereading: we need a valid subsequence. Let me check from both directions:

```python
def is_nested(string):

1. Find the intersection of two intervals
2. Calculate the length of the intersection
3. Check if that length is a prime number
4. Return ""YES"" if prime, ""NO"" otherwise

Let me think through this step by step:

**Finding the intersection:**
- The intersection starts at `max(start1, start2)`
- The intersection ends at `min(end1, end2)`
- If start > end, there's no intersection

**Calculating length:**
- For a closed interval (a, b), the length is `b - a + 1` (includes both endpoints)

**Checking if prime:**
- A prime number is > 1 and only divisible by 1 and itself

Let me verify with the examples:
- `intersection((1, 2), (2, 3))`: intersection is (2, 2), length = 1, not prime → ""NO"" ✓
- `intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4))`: intersection is (0, 1), length = 2, prime → should be ""YES""... but expected is ""NO""

Wait, let me recalculate: (-1, 1) ∩ (0, 4) = (0, 1), length = 1 - 0 + 1 = 2. But the expected output is ""NO"". Let me check if 2 is considered prime here... Actually, looking at the third example:
- `intersection((-3, -1), (-5, 5))`: intersection is (-3, -1), length = -1 - (-3) + 1 = 3, prime → ""YES"" ✓

So 2 should be prime. Let me reconsider the second example. Maybe I miscalculated? Actually, 2 IS prime, so there might be an issue with the expected output, or I need to reconsider the problem.

Looking more carefully at example 1: (1,2) ∩ (2,3) = (2,2), length = 1. The problem states ""which its length is 1, which not a prime number"" - so 1 is explicitly not considered prime here (which is mathematically correct).

Let me implement the solution:

```python
def intersection(interval1, interval2):
    # Find the intersection
    start = max(interval1[0], interval2[0])
    end = min(interval1[1], interval2[1])
    
    # Check if there's a valid intersection
    if start > end:
        return ""NO""
    
    # Calculate the length of the intersection (closed interval)
    length = end - start + 1
    
    # Check if length is prime
    if is_prime(length):
        return ""YES""
    else:
        return ""NO""

            return False
        i += 2

**Understanding the problem:**
1. Split the sentence into words
2. Check if each word's length is a prime number
3. Keep only words with prime lengths
4. Return them in the same order, joined by spaces

**Key insight:** I need a helper function to check if a number is prime.

Here's my solution:

```python
def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    """"""
    You are given a string representing a sentence,
    the sentence contains some words separated by a space,
    and you have to return a string that contains the words from the original sentence,
    whose lengths are prime numbers,
    the order of the words in the new string should be the same as the original one.

    Example 1:
        Input: sentence = ""This is a test""
        Output: ""is""

    Example 2:
        Input: sentence = ""lets go for swimming""
        Output: ""go for""

    Constraints:
        * 1 <= len(sentence) <= 100
        * sentence contains only letters
    """"""
    
    def is_prime(n):
        """"""Check if a number is prime.""""""
        if n < 2:
            return False
        if n == 2:
            return True
        if n % 2 == 0:
            return False
        for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
            if n % i == 0:
                return False
        return True
    
    # Split sentence into words
    words = sentence.split()
    
    # Filter words whose lengths are prime
    prime_length_words = [word for word in words if is_prime(len(word))]
    
    # Join and return
    return "" "".join(prime_length_words)
```

**Verification with examples:**

Example 1: ""This is a test""
- ""This"" → length 4 (not prime: 4 = 2×2)
- ""is"" → length 2 (prime ✓)
- ""a"" → length 1 (not prime)
- ""test"" → length 4 (not prime)
- Output: ""is"" ✓

Example 2: ""lets go for swimming""
- ""lets"" → length 4 (not prime)
- ""go"" → length 2 (prime ✓)
- ""for"" → length 3 (prime ✓)
- ""swimming"" → length 8 (not prime: 8 = 2×4)
- Output: ""go for"" ✓",0.009894,8.43303370475769,0,0,claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,,
humaneval,HumanEval/134,Oracle,1,"Looking at this problem, I need to check if:
1. The last character is an alphabetical character
2. It's not part of a word (i.e., it's a standalone letter separated by spaces)

Let me think through the examples:
- `""apple pie""` → last char is 'e', which is part of the word ""pie"" → False
- `""apple pi e""` → last char is 'e', which is standalone (space before it) → True
- `""apple pi e ""` → last char is a space, not a letter → False
- `""""` → empty string → False

Here's my solution:

```python
def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):
    '''
    Create a function that returns True if the last character
    of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not
    a part of a word, and False otherwise.
    Note: ""word"" is a group of characters separated by space.

    Examples:
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(""apple pie"") ➞ False
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(""apple pi e"") ➞ True
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(""apple pi e "") ➞ False
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("""") ➞ False 
    '''
    # Check if string is empty or last character is not a letter
    if not txt or not txt[-1].isalpha():
        return False
    
    # If string has only one character, it's a standalone letter
    if len(txt) == 1:
        return True
    
    # Check if the character before the last one is a space
    # This means the last character is not part of a word
    return txt[-2] == ' '
```

- `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(""apple pie"")` → last char 'e', but txt[-2] is 'i' (not space) → False ✓
- `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(""apple pi e"")` → last char 'e', txt[-2] is ' ' → True ✓

humaneval,HumanEval/42,Oracle,1,"Here's a clean implementation of the `incr_list` function:

```python
def incr_list(l: list):
    """"""Return list with elements incremented by 1.
    >>> incr_list([1, 2, 3])
    [2, 3, 4]

    [6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]
    """"""
    return [x + 1 for x in l]
```

This function uses a list comprehension to iterate through each element in the input list and increment it by 1, returning a new list with the incremented values.

**Alternative implementations:**

Using `map`:
```python
def incr_list(l: list):
    return list(map(lambda x: x + 1, l))
```

Using a traditional loop:
```python
def incr_list(l: list):
    result = []
    for x in l:
        result.append(x + 1)
    return result
```

humaneval,HumanEval/158,Oracle,1,"Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Find the word with the maximum number of unique characters
2. If there's a tie, return the lexicographically smallest word
3. Handle edge cases

Let me trace through the examples:
- `[""name"", ""of"", ""string""]`: ""name"" has 4 unique chars, ""of"" has 2, ""string"" has 6 → return ""string""
- `[""name"", ""enam"", ""game""]`: all have 4 unique chars, lexicographically ""enam"" < ""game"" < ""name"" → return ""enam""
- `[""aaaaaaa"", ""bb"", ""cc""]`: all have 1 unique char, ""aaaaaaa"" < ""bb"" < ""cc"" → return ""aaaaaaa""

Here's the solution:

```python
def find_max(words):
    """"""Write a function that accepts a list of strings.
    The list contains different words. Return the word with maximum number
    of unique characters. If multiple strings have maximum number of unique
    characters, return the one which comes first in lexicographical order.

    find_max([""name"", ""of"", ""string""]) == ""string""
    find_max([""name"", ""enam"", ""game""]) == ""enam""
    find_max([""aaaaaaa"", ""bb"" ,""cc""]) == ""aaaaaaa""
    """"""
    if not words:
        return """"
    
    # Find the maximum using a custom key:
    # Primary: maximize unique character count (negative for max)
    # Secondary: minimize lexicographical order
    return max(words, key=lambda word: (len(set(word)), -ord(word[0]) if word else 0, [-ord(c) for c in word]))
```

Wait, that's getting complex. Let me use a clearer approach:

```python
def find_max(words):
    """"""Write a function that accepts a list of strings.
    The list contains different words. Return the word with maximum number
    of unique characters. If multiple strings have maximum number of unique
    characters, return the one which comes first in lexicographical order.

    find_max([""name"", ""enam"", ""game""]) == ""enam""
    find_max([""aaaaaaa"", ""bb"" ,""cc""]) == ""aaaaaaa""
    """"""
    if not words:
        return """"
    
    # Sort by: 1) number of unique chars (descending), 2) lexicographical order (ascending)
    return sorted(words, key=lambda word: (-len(set(word)), word))[0]
```

This solution:
- Returns empty string if the list is empty
- Sorts words by two criteria:
  - `-len(set(word))`: negative count of unique characters (so higher counts come first)
  - `word`: the word itself for lexicographical ordering
- Returns the first element after sorting",0.0113339999999999,10.19976043701172,0,0,claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,,
