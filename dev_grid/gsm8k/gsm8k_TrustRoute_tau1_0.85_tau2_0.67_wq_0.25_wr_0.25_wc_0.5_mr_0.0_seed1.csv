- Kyle paid $19.50 after a 25% discount, which means he paid 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).
- Let the original price be \( P \). So, we can set up the equation:

If their ages are in the ratio 7:11, I can express their ages as:
- Darrell's age = 7x
- Allen's age = 11x

where x is a common multiplier.

**Step 2: Use the total age to find x**

Their total age is 162, so:

x = 162 ÷ 18
x = 9

**Step 3: Find Allen's current age**

Allen's current age = 11x = 11 × 9 = 99 years

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of games played is 22:
   W + L = 22

2. They won 8 more games than they lost:
   W = L + 8

Now we can solve this system of equations. Substitute the second equation into the first one:
(L + 8) + L = 22
2L + 8 = 22
2L = 22 - 8
2L = 14
L = 14 / 2
L = 7

Now that we know the number of games lost (L = 7), we can find the number of games won (W) using the second equation:
W = L + 8
W = 7 + 8
W = 15

So, the team won 15 games.

Won = 15
Lost = 7
Total games = 15 + 7 = 22 (Correct)

### Step 1: Define the variables
- Let \( H \) represent the number of copies Harald sold.
- Marilyn sold 10 times as many copies as Harald, so Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies.

### Step 2: Set up the equation
- Together, they sold 88,000 copies, so:
  \[
  H + 10H = 88,000
  \]
- Simplify the equation:
  \[
  11H = 88,000

### Step 3: Solve for \( H \)

    Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.

2.  **Determine Gerald's original time:**
    The problem states, ""Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald would run the 400-meter hurdles."" This means Lee's time was 2 seconds less than Gerald's original time.

    Gerald's original time = 38 seconds + 2 seconds = 40 seconds.

3.  **Calculate Gerald's improved time:**
    Gerald's speed improved by 10%. When speed increases by a certain percentage, the time taken to cover the same distance decreases. If speed increases by 10% (i.e., becomes 110% or 1.1 times the original speed), the new time will be `1 / 1.1` times the original time.

The total amount of sugar and water combined is 120 teaspoons and cups. Since the units are different but the ratio is based on numerical values, the total numerical value is 120.

Let the number of teaspoons of sugar be \(7x\) and the number of cups of water be \(13x\). The total is then:
\[
7x + 13x = 20x
\]
Given that the total is 120:
\[
20x = 120

Solving for \(x\):
\[
x = \frac{120}{20} = 6
\]
Therefore, the number of teaspoons of sugar is:
\[
7x = 7 \times 6 = 42

Verification:
- Sugar: 42 teaspoons

1.  **Adrien's salary four years ago:**
    Given, Adrien earned $40,000 four years ago.

2.  **Lylah's salary four years ago:**
    Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. This means Adrien's salary was 130% of Lylah's salary.
    Let L_old be Lylah's salary four years ago.
    $40,000 = L_old * (1 + 0.30)
    $40,000 = L_old * 1.30
    L_old = $40,000 / 1.30
    L_old = $30,769.2307... (approximately $30,769.23)

3.  **Adrien's salary four years later:**
    Adrien's salary increased by 40% from what he was making four years ago.
    Adrien's new salary = $40,000 * (1 + 0.40)
    Adrien's new salary = $40,000 * 1.40
    Adrien's new salary = $56,000

4.  **Lylah's salary four years later:**
    The problem states that ""Adrien's and Lylah's salary increased simultaneously"". In such problems, if a percentage increase is given for one person over a period, it's generally implied that the other person's salary increased by the same percentage during that period unless stated otherwise, or that their percentage relationship remained constant. If Lylah's salary also increased by 40%, the ratio of their salaries would remain the same (Adrien still earning 30% more than Lylah). We will proceed with this interpretation.
    Lylah's new salary = L_old * (1 + 0.40)
    Lylah's new salary = ($40,000 / 1.30) * 1.40
    Lylah's new salary = $30,769.2307... * 1.40
    Lylah's new salary = $43,076.9230... (approximately $43,076.92)

5.  **Total salary of the two four years later:**

Let \( b \) represent the number of blue gumballs. According to the problem, \( b = 12 \).

Let \( p \) represent the number of pink gumballs. The problem states that there are 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs as there are pink gumballs. This can be expressed with the equation:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of clients
- Kim has 3 existing clients.
- He is including 5 potential clients in his calculations.
- Total clients = 3 + 5 = 8 clients.

### Step 2: Calculate the expenses per client
- Each client requires:
  - 2 bottles of bleach at $2 each = 2 × $2 = $4.
  - 1 pack of cloths at $5 each = 1 × $5 = $5.
- Total expenses per client = $4 (bleach) + $5 (cloths) = $9.

### Step 3: Calculate total expenses for all clients
- For 8 clients:
  - Total bleach needed = 8 clients × 2 bottles = 16 bottles.
  - Total cost for bleach = 16 bottles × $2 = $32.
  - Total cloths needed = 8 clients × 1 pack = 8 packs.
  - Total cost for cloths = 8 packs × $5 = $40.
- Total expenses = $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72.

### Step 4: Calculate profit

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **At the end:** There were 5 fries left after the ants carried off 1 fry.
   - Before the ants, there must have been \(5 + 1 = 6\) fries.

2. **Before the ants:** The raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, leaving 6 fries.
   - Let \(Y\) be the number of fries before the raccoon stole any.
   - The raccoon left one-third of \(Y\), so \(\frac{1}{3}Y = 6\).
   - Solving for \(Y\): \(Y = 6 \times 3 = 18\).
   - So, before the raccoon, there were 18 fries.

3. **Before the raccoon:** Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate \(3 \times 3 = 9\) fries.
   - Before the pigeons, there must have been \(18 + 9 = 27\) fries.

4. **Before the pigeons:** The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate. Dave ate 14 fries, so the seagull ate \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) fries.
   - Before the seagull, there must have been \(27 + 7 = 34\) fries.

5. **Before the seagull:** Dave ate 14 fries.
   - Before Dave ate any, there must have been \(34 + 14 = 48\) fries.

### Verification:
Let's simulate forward to confirm:
- Start with 48 fries.
- Dave eats 14: \(48 - 14 = 34\) left.
- Seagull eats 7: \(34 - 7 = 27\) left.
- Pigeons eat 9: \(27 - 9 = 18\) left.
- Raccoon steals two-thirds of 18 (\( \frac{2}{3} \times 18 = 12 \)): \(18 - 12 = 6\) left.
- Ants carry off 1: \(6 - 1 = 5\) left.

gsm8k,gsm8k-162,TrustRoute,1,"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the problem
- The original price of the bag is $20.
- The price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.
- 20% of the original price is calculated as:  
  \( 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \) dollars.
- So, every two months, the price increases by a fixed amount of $4 (not based on the new price, but always on the original $20).

### Step 2: Calculate the number of increases
- There are 36 months in total.
- Increases happen every 2 months, so the number of increases is:  
  \( 36 \div 2 = 18 \) increases.

### Step 3: Calculate the total increase
- Each increase is $4.
- Over 18 increases, the total increase is:  
  \( 18 \times 4 = 72 \) dollars.

### Step 4: Calculate the final price
- Start with the original price: $20.
- Add the total increase:  
  \( 20 + 72 = 92 \) dollars.

### Final Answer
After 36 months, the cost of a bag of marbles would be **$92**.",0.0070597,13.184605836868286,0,0,cand-grok-3-mini,stage2_confidence,

   - Computer: €1090
   - Scanner: €157
   - CD burner: €74

   \]

2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28:

gsm8k,gsm8k-186,TrustRoute,1,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the distribution of straw**:
   - Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
   - Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
   - A total of 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

2. **Calculate the total straw used for rabbits**:
   - The rabbits receive 20 pieces of straw.

3. **Calculate the remaining straw for rats and hamsters**:
   - Total straw distributed = 160 pieces.
   - Straw used for rabbits = 20 pieces.
   - Therefore, straw used for rats and hamsters = 160 - 20 = 140 pieces.

4. **Set up the equations for rats and hamsters**:
   - Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage.
   - There are 3 cages of rats, so the total number of rats = \( 3r \).
   - Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, so the total straw for rats = \( 3r \times 6 = 18r \).

   - There are 10 cages of hamsters. Let \( h \) be the number of hamsters in each cage.
   - The total number of hamsters = \( 10h \).
   - Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw, so the total straw for hamsters = \( 10h \times 5 = 50h \).

5. **Set up the equation for total straw used**:
   \[
   18r + 50h = 140
   \]

6. **Solve for \( h \)**:
   - Rearranging gives:
   \[
   50h = 140 - 18r
   \]
   \[
   h = \frac{140 - 18r}{50}
   \]

   Since \( h \) must be a whole number, \( 140 - 18r \) must be divisible by 50.

7. **Finding suitable values for \( r \)**:
   - Let's test integer values for \( r \) to find when \( 140 - 18r \) is divisible by 50.

   - For \( r = 0 \):
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 0}{50} = 2.8 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]

   - For \( r = 1 \):
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18}{50} = \frac{122}{50} = 2.44 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]

   - For \( r = 2 \):
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 36}{50} = \frac{104}{50} = 2.08 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]

   - For \( r = 3 \):
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 54}{50} = \frac{86}{50} = 1.72 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]

   - For \( r = 4 \):
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 72}{50} = \frac{68}{50} = 1.36 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]

   - For \( r = 5 \):
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 90}{50} = \frac{50}{50} = 1 \quad \text{(integer)}
     \]

   - For \( r = 6 \):
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 108}{50} = \frac{32}{50} = 0.64 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]

   - For \( r = 7 \):
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 126}{50} = \frac{14}{50} = 0.28 \quad \text{(not an integer)}

gsm8k,gsm8k-187,TrustRoute,1,"To calculate how much Mandy should pay Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can use the formula for compound interest. The formula is:

\[ A = P(1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n months, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (as a decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of months the money is borrowed.

In this case:
- \( P = 100 \) (the amount owed)
- \( r = 0.02 \) (2% interest rate)
- \( n = 3 \) (the number of months)

Now, we can plug in the values:

\[ A = 100(1 + 0.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100(1.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 \times 1.061208 \]

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of bags of wheat the trader bought and sold.

2. **Calculate Costs**:
   - The cost of buying the bags: \( 20x \) (since each bag costs $20).
   - The cost of transporting the bags: \( 2x \) (since it costs $2 to transport each bag).
   - Total cost: 
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = 20x + 2x = 22x
     \]

3. **Calculate Revenue**:
   - The selling price per bag is $30, so the total revenue from selling \( x \) bags is:
     \[
     \text{Total Revenue} = 30x
     \]

4. **Calculate Profit**:
   - Profit is defined as total revenue minus total costs:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost}
     \]
   - Substituting the expressions for total revenue and total cost:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = 30x - 22x = 8x
     \]

5. **Set Up the Equation**:
   - We know the total profit is $400, so we set up the equation:
     \[
     8x = 400
     \]

6. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - Divide both sides by 8:
