3. We initialize an empty list `result` to store the Roman numeral symbols.
4. We iterate over each value-symbol pair in `roman_numerals`. For each pair, we subtract the value from the number as many times as possible, appending the corresponding symbol to `result`.
5. Finally, we join the list into a single string and return it.

humaneval,HumanEval/119,SC-5,1,"To determine if we can concatenate two strings of parentheses in such a way that the resulting string is balanced, we need to check the counts of open and close parentheses in both strings. A string is considered balanced if, at no point in the string, the number of closing parentheses exceeds the number of opening parentheses, and at the end of the string, the counts of both types of parentheses are equal.

Here's how we can implement the `match_parens` function:

1. Count the number of opening and closing parentheses in both strings.
2. Check if there exists an order of concatenation (either `s1 + s2` or `s2 + s1`) that results in a balanced string.

The conditions for a balanced string when concatenating two strings `s1` and `s2` are:
- For `s1 + s2`: At no point in the concatenation should the number of closing parentheses exceed the number of opening parentheses.
- For `s2 + s1`: The same condition applies.

Here’s the implementation of the `match_parens` function:

```python
def match_parens(lst):
    s1, s2 = lst[0], lst[1]
    
    # Count the number of open and close parentheses in both strings
    open1 = s1.count('(')
    close1 = s1.count(')')
    open2 = s2.count('(')
    close2 = s2.count(')')
    
    # Check the two possible concatenations
    # Check s1 + s2
    if open1 >= close2 and (open1 - close2) + open2 >= close1:
        return 'Yes'
    
    # Check s2 + s1
    if open2 >= close1 and (open2 - close1) + open1 >= close2:

    return 'No'

# Test cases
print(match_parens(['()(', ')']))  # Output: 'Yes'
print(match_parens([')', ')']))     # Output: 'No'
```

### Explanation:
- We count the number of opening and closing parentheses in both strings.
- We check the conditions for both possible concatenations:
  - For `s1 + s2`, we ensure that the number of opening parentheses in `s1` is at least as many as the closing parentheses in `s2` (to avoid premature closing) and that the total number of opening parentheses can balance out the closing ones.
  - For `s2 + s1`, we perform a similar check.
- If either concatenation can result in a balanced string, we return 'Yes'; otherwise, we return 'No'.",0.0017330999999999,31.63955354690552,,True,

humaneval,HumanEval/1,SC-5,1,"To solve the problem of separating groups of nested parentheses from a given string, we can follow these steps:

1. **Remove Spaces**: First, we need to ignore any spaces in the input string.
2. **Iterate Through the String**: We will iterate through the characters of the string while keeping track of the balance of parentheses using a counter.
3. **Identify Groups**: Whenever we encounter an opening parenthesis `(`, we will increase the counter, and when we encounter a closing parenthesis `)`, we will decrease the counter. When the counter returns to zero, it indicates that we have found a complete group of parentheses.
4. **Store Groups**: We will store each complete group in a list and return that list at the end.

Here is the implementation of the `separate_paren_groups` function:

```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:

    return groups

# Example usage
print(separate_paren_groups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))'))  # Output: ['()', '(())', '(()())']

### Explanation of the Code:
- We start by removing any spaces from the input string using `replace`.
- We initialize an empty list `groups` to store the separated groups and `current_group` to build each group.
- We use a `balance` variable to track the number of open and close parentheses.
- As we iterate through each character, we append it to `current_group` and adjust the `balance`.
- When `balance` reaches zero, it indicates that we have a complete group, and we join the characters in `current_group` into a string and append it to `groups`.
- Finally, we return the list of groups.

### Explanation:
1. We start with a `balance` initialized to zero.
2. We iterate through each operation in the `operations` list.
3. For each operation, we update the `balance` by adding the operation value (which can be positive for deposits or negative for withdrawals).
4. After updating the balance, we check if it has fallen below zero. If it has, we return `True`.

### Explanation:
1. **`convert_to_number` function**: This helper function converts a string representation of a number into a float. It replaces commas with dots to handle different decimal formats. If the conversion fails, it returns the original string.

2. **`compare_one` function**:
   - It first converts both inputs using `convert_to_number`.
   - It checks if the converted values are equal. If they are, it returns `None`.
   - If they are not equal, it returns the original variable that corresponds to the larger converted value.

humaneval,HumanEval/41,SC-5,1,"To determine the number of collisions between two sets of cars moving towards each other, we can analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Understanding the Movement**: Each car in the first set (moving left to right) will eventually collide with each car in the second set (moving right to left). Since all cars are moving at the same speed and continue on their paths regardless of collisions, every car from the first set will collide with every car from the second set.

2. **Calculating Collisions**: If there are `n` cars moving left to right and `n` cars moving right to left, the total number of collisions can be calculated as the product of the number of cars in each direction. Therefore, the total number of collisions is `n * n`, which simplifies to `n^2`.

3. **Implementation**: The function will take an integer `n` as input and return `n^2`.

1. **Understand the Right Shift Operation**: A right shift operation moves the last element of the array to the front and shifts all other elements one position to the right. This means that after a certain number of shifts, the array will appear as if it has been rotated.

2. **Identify the Sorted Condition**: For the array to be sorted after some right shifts, there should be at most one point in the array where the order breaks (i.e., where a larger number is followed by a smaller number). This is because a sorted array can be visualized as a circular array where the largest element wraps around to the smallest.

3. **Count the Breaks**: We can iterate through the array and count how many times the current element is greater than the next element. If this count is more than one, it means we cannot sort the array with right shifts.

4. **Edge Cases**: If the array is empty, we return `True` since an empty array is trivially sorted.

1. Define the function `unique_digits` that takes a list of integers as input.
2. Create an empty list to store the integers that meet the criteria.
3. For each integer in the input list, convert it to a string to check each digit.
4. Check if any digit in the string representation of the integer is even (i.e., one of '0', '2', '4', '6', '8').

1. **Convert to String**: The integer `x` is converted to a string to easily manipulate its digits.
2. **Check Shift**: If the `shift` is greater than or equal to the number of digits, we reverse the string.
3. **Effective Shift**: We calculate the effective shift using modulo operation to handle cases where the shift is larger than the number of digits.

A prefix is defined as any substring that starts from the beginning of the string and extends to any point within it. We can achieve this by iterating through the string and collecting the prefixes.

Here's the complete implementation of the function:

```python
from typing import List

```

### Explanation:
1. We use a list comprehension to generate the prefixes.
2. The `range(1, len(string) + 1)` generates numbers from 1 to the length of the string, inclusive.
3. For each number `i`, `string[:i]` gives us the substring from the start of the string up to (but not including) index `i`.
4. The result is a list of all prefixes from the shortest to the longest.

4. If `lst1` has odd numbers but `lst2` has no even numbers, return ""NO"".
5. If there are odd numbers in `lst1` and at least one even number in `lst2`, return ""YES"".

### Explanation:
1. **Length Check**: The function first checks if the length of the string is less than 3. If it is, the function returns `False`.
2. **Iterate Through the String**: The function then iterates through the string, checking each group of 3 consecutive characters.
3. **Distinct Check**: For each group of 3 characters, it converts the group into a set (which removes duplicates) and checks if the length of the set is 3. If it's not, it means there are duplicates in that group, and the function returns `False`.
4. **Return True**: If all groups of 3 characters pass the distinct check, the function returns `True`.

3. Update the maximum level of nesting encountered for that group whenever we encounter an opening parenthesis `(`.
4. Decrease the counter when we encounter a closing parenthesis `)`.
5. Store the maximum level for each group and return the results as a list.

### Explanation:
- We first split the input string into groups using `split()`, which separates the string by spaces.
- For each group, we initialize `max_depth` and `current_depth` to zero.
- We iterate through each character in the group:
  - If we encounter `(`, we increase the `current_depth` and check if it's the maximum depth so far.
  - If we encounter `)`, we decrease the `current_depth`.
- After processing each group, we append the maximum depth found to the `results` list.

### Explanation:
1. We initialize an empty list `result` to store the computed values.
2. We loop through numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
3. For each index `i`:
   - If `i` is even, we calculate the factorial by multiplying all integers from 1 to `i`.
   - If `i` is odd, we calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to `i` using the `sum` function.
4. Finally, we return the `result` list containing the computed values.",0.0014401499999999,26.73339891433716,,True,

### Explanation:
1. The function first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1. If so, it only returns `True` if `x` is 1, since any number to the power of 0 is 1.
2. It initializes a variable `power` to 1 and enters a loop where it calculates `n ** power`.
3. If the result equals `x`, it returns `True`.
4. If the result exceeds `x`, it returns `False` since further increasing the power will only increase the result.

Here's how we can implement the `find_zero` function step by step:

1. **Define the polynomial function**: We already have the `poly` function that evaluates the polynomial at a given point.
2. **Define the derivative of the polynomial**: We need to compute the derivative of the polynomial, which can also be done using the coefficients.
3. **Implement the Newton-Raphson method**: This involves iteratively updating the guess for the root using the formula:
   \[
   x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}

2. **Count Changes**: We can iterate through the first half of the array and compare each element with its corresponding element from the end of the array. If they are not equal, we will need to change one of them to make them equal.

3. **Return the Count**: The total number of changes needed will be the count of these mismatches.

### Explanation:
1. We use `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each integer in the list.
2. We initialize a variable `result` to -1, which will hold the greatest integer that meets the criteria.
3. We iterate through each unique integer and its frequency in the `frequency` dictionary.
4. For each integer, we check if its frequency is greater than or equal to the integer itself.
5. If it is, we update `result` to be the maximum of the current `result` and the integer.
6. Finally, we return `result`, which will be -1 if no integers met the criteria.",0.0014300999999999,32.75396251678467,,True,
humaneval,HumanEval/129,SC-5,1,"To solve the problem of finding the minimum path of length `k` in a grid, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. The idea is to explore all possible paths of length `k` starting from each cell in the grid, while keeping track of the lexicographically smallest path found.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Define the DFS function**: This function will take the current position in the grid, the current path, and the length of the path so far.

2. **Base case**: If the length of the current path is equal to `k`, we compare it with the best path found so far and update it if the current path is lexicographically smaller.

3. **Recursive exploration**: From the current cell, we can move to its neighboring cells (up, down, left, right) as long as we stay within the bounds of the grid.

4. **Start DFS from each cell**: We initiate the DFS from each cell in the grid.

5. **Return the best path**: After exploring all possible paths, we return the lexicographically smallest path found.

Here is the implementation of the above logic:

```python
def minPath(grid, k):
    from collections import deque
    
    N = len(grid)
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]  # right, down, left, up
    best_path = None
    
    def dfs(x, y, path):
        nonlocal best_path
        if len(path) == k:
            if best_path is None or path < best_path:
                best_path = path[:]
            return
        
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N:
                path.append(grid[nx][ny])
                dfs(nx, ny, path)
                path.pop()  # backtrack
    
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            dfs(i, j, [grid[i][j]])
    
    return best_path

# Example usage:
grid1 = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
k1 = 3
print(minPath(grid1, k1))  # Output: [1, 2, 1]

grid2 = [[5, 9, 3], [4, 1, 6], [7, 8, 2]]
k2 = 1
print(minPath(grid2, k2))  # Output: [1]
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We define the `minPath` function which initializes the grid size and possible movement directions.
- The `dfs` function performs the depth-first search, checking if the current path length equals `k` and updating the best path if necessary.
- We start the DFS from each cell in the grid, allowing us to explore all possible paths of length `k`.
- Finally, we return the best path found.

humaneval,HumanEval/83,SC-5,1,"To solve the problem of counting n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1, we can break it down into a few steps:

1. **Understanding n-digit integers**: An n-digit positive integer ranges from \(10^{(n-1)}\) to \(10^n - 1\). For example, for \(n = 3\), the range is from 100 to 999.

2. **Counting integers that start with 1**: 
   - If an n-digit integer starts with 1, the first digit is fixed as 1. The remaining \(n-1\) digits can be any digit from 0 to 9.
   - Therefore, there are \(10^{(n-1)}\) integers that start with 1.

3. **Counting integers that end with 1**:
   - If an n-digit integer ends with 1, the last digit is fixed as 1. The first digit can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since it cannot be 0), and the remaining \(n-2\) digits can be any digit from 0 to 9.
   - Therefore, there are \(9 \times 10^{(n-2)}\) integers that end with 1.

4. **Avoiding double counting**: 
   - Some integers both start and end with 1 (e.g., 101, 111, 121, etc.). We need to count these separately.
   - If an n-digit integer starts and ends with 1, the first digit is 1, the last digit is 1, and the remaining \(n-2\) digits can be any digit from 0 to 9.
   - Therefore, there are \(10^{(n-2)}\) integers that start and end with 1.

5. **Final calculation**: 
   - The total count of n-digit integers that start or end with 1 can be calculated using the principle of inclusion-exclusion:
   \[
   \text{Total} = (\text{Count starting with 1}) + (\text{Count ending with 1}) - (\text{Count starting and ending with 1})
   \]

Now, let's implement this logic in the function `starts_one_ends`:

def starts_one_ends(n):
    """"""
    Given a positive integer n, return the count of the numbers of n-digit
    positive integers that start or end with 1.

    # Count of n-digit numbers ending with 1

### Explanation:
- We concatenate `b` with itself to create `b_rotations`.
- We then check if any substring of length equal to `b` from `b_rotations` exists in `a`.
- The `any()` function returns `True` if at least one rotation is found in `a`, otherwise it returns `False`.

    """"""Change numerical base of input number x to base.
    return string representation after the conversion.

        return '0'
    
    digits = []
    while x > 0:
        remainder = x % base
        digits.append(str(remainder))
        x //= base
    
    # The digits are in reverse order, so we need to reverse them
    digits.reverse()

```

### Explanation:
- The function starts by checking if `x` is 0, in which case it returns '0'.
- It then enters a loop where it calculates the remainder of `x` when divided by `base`, appending this remainder to the `digits` list.
- The number `x` is then divided by `base` using integer division to continue the process.
- After the loop, the `digits` list contains the digits in reverse order, so we reverse it and join the list into a string to return the final result.",0.0013289999999999,26.823845624923703,,True,

humaneval,HumanEval/147,SC-5,1,"To solve the problem of counting the number of valid triples `(a[i], a[j], a[k])` such that their sum is a multiple of 3, we can follow these steps:

1. **Generate the Array**: First, we need to create the array `a` based on the formula provided: `a[i] = i * i - i + 1`.

2. **Count Remainders**: Since we are interested in sums that are multiples of 3, we can categorize the elements of the array based on their remainders when divided by 3. There are three possible remainders: 0, 1, and 2.

3. **Count Valid Triples**: Using the counts of each remainder, we can determine how many valid triples can be formed. The valid combinations of remainders that sum to a multiple of 3 are:
   - Three elements with remainder 0.
   - Three elements with remainder 1.
   - Three elements with remainder 2.
   - One element from each remainder category (0, 1, and 2).

4. **Calculate Combinations**: We can use combinatorial counting to calculate the number of ways to choose the triples from the counts of each remainder.

Here is the implementation of the above logic in Python:

    # Step 1: Generate the array a
    a = [i * i - i + 1 for i in range(1, n + 1)]

3. After handling 2, we can check for odd factors starting from 3 up to the square root of `n`.

The goal is to find the longest palindromic suffix of the input string and then append the reverse of the prefix (the part of the string before this suffix) to the end of the string. Here’s how we can do that step by step:

1. Start with the input string.
2. Check for the longest palindromic suffix by iterating from the end of the string towards the beginning.
3. For each position, check if the substring from that position to the end is a palindrome.
4. Once we find the longest palindromic suffix, take the prefix (the part of the string before this suffix) and reverse it.

### Explanation:
1. We initialize an empty list `stack` to keep track of the opening brackets.
2. We also use a boolean variable `has_nested` to check if we have found any nested brackets.
3. We iterate through each character in the input string:
   - If we encounter an opening bracket `[`, we push it onto the stack.
   - If we encounter a closing bracket `]`, we check if there's an opening bracket in the stack:
     - If there is, we pop it from the stack.
     - If the stack still has elements after popping, it means we have a nested structure, so we set `has_nested` to `True`.
4. Finally, we return the value of `has_nested`, which indicates whether there was any nested bracket structure.

humaneval,HumanEval/115,SC-5,1,"To solve the problem of determining how many times we need to lower the buckets to empty the wells represented by a grid, we can follow these steps:

1. **Count the Water Units**: For each row in the grid, count the number of `1`s, which represent units of water in that well.
2. **Calculate Buckets Needed**: For each well, determine how many times we need to lower the bucket based on the capacity. This can be calculated as the ceiling of the number of water units divided by the bucket capacity.
3. **Sum the Total**: Add up the number of times we need to lower the buckets for all wells to get the final result.

Here's the implementation of the above logic in Python:

```python
def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    import math
    
    total_lowerings = 0
    
    for row in grid:
        # Count the number of water units (1s) in the current well (row)
        water_units = sum(row)
        
        # Calculate how many times we need to lower the bucket for this well
        if water_units > 0:
            lowerings = math.ceil(water_units / capacity)
            total_lowerings += lowerings
            
    return total_lowerings

# Example usage:
print(max_fill([[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]], 1))  # Output: 6
print(max_fill([[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]], 2))  # Output: 5
print(max_fill([[0,0,0], [0,0,0]], 5))  # Output: 0
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We import the `math` module to use the `ceil` function for rounding up the division result.
- We initialize `total_lowerings` to zero to keep track of the total number of times we lower the buckets.
- We iterate through each row of the grid, count the `1`s to get the number of water units, and then calculate how many times we need to lower the bucket using the ceiling of the division of water units by the bucket capacity.
- Finally, we return the total number of lowerings needed.

### Explanation:
1. We iterate through each character in the input string.

3. Depending on whether the letter is lowercase or uppercase, we set the `base` to the ASCII value of 'a' or 'A'.
4. We calculate the new character by shifting the current character's position by 4, using modulo 26 to wrap around if necessary.
