1. **Calculate the total investment**: This includes the purchase price of the house and the cost of repairs.
   \[
   \text{Total Investment} = \text{Purchase Price} + \text{Repair Costs} = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000

2. **Determine the increased value of the house**: The value of the house increased by 150%. To find the new value, we first calculate 150% of the original purchase price.
   \[
   \text{Increase in Value} = 150\% \times \text{Purchase Price} = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000

### Step 1: Calculate the total time required for the entire trip
- Average speed is defined as total distance divided by total time.
- Total distance: 12 miles
- Desired average speed: 4 miles per hour
- Total time required = Total distance / Desired average speed = 12 miles / 4 mph = 3 hours

- Remaining distance: Total distance - Distance covered = 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles
- Time already spent: 2 hours
- Time available for the remaining distance: Total time required - Time spent = 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour

Next, we subtract this total from the amount Marie paid to find out how much she spent on pizza:
\[
50 - 33 = 17 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we need to determine how many boxes of pizza she can buy with the remaining $17. Each box of pizza costs $8.50. We can find the number of boxes by dividing the remaining amount by the cost per box:
\[
\text{Number of boxes} = \frac{17}{8.50}
\]

Calculating this gives:
\[
\frac{17}{8.50} \approx 2
\]

To confirm, we can calculate the total cost for 2 boxes of pizza:
\[
2 \text{ boxes} \times 8.50 = 17 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount spent on pizza is exactly $17, which matches the remaining amount after purchasing the other items.

2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins:

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation. Replacing \( G \) in the first equation gives us:

Let me define the variable:
- Let x = number of cookies Henry baked last year

Now I'll trace through what happened this year:

1. **This year's goal**: Henry wanted to make twice as many as last year = 2x

2. **What he actually baked**: He baked 15 more than he meant to = 2x + 15

3. **After dropping some**: He dropped 5 cookies = (2x + 15) - 5

4. **Final count**: He now has 110 cookies

So I can write the equation:
(2x + 15) - 5 = 110

Solving for x:
2x + 15 - 5 = 110
2x + 10 = 110
2x = 100
x = 50

### Step 1: Calculate Julia's rowing speed
- It takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet.
- Rowing speed = distance / time = 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet per second.

### Step 2: Calculate the total distance to the shore

**1. Adrien's salary four years ago:**
Adrien's salary four years ago (A_old) = $40,000

**2. Lylah's salary four years ago:**
Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. This means Adrien's salary was 130% of Lylah's salary.
A_old = 1.30 * Lylah's salary four years ago (L_old)
$40,000 = 1.30 * L_old
L_old = $40,000 / 1.30
L_old ≈ $30,769.23

**3. Adrien's current salary (four years later):**
Adrien's salary increased by 40% from what he was making four years ago.
Adrien's current salary (A_new) = A_old * (1 + 0.40)
A_new = $40,000 * 1.40
A_new = $56,000

**4. Lylah's current salary (four years later):**
The problem states ""Adrien's and Lylah's salary increased simultaneously"" and the initial condition ""Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's"". A reasonable interpretation is that either the 30% difference is maintained, or Lylah's salary also increased by the same percentage as Adrien's. Both interpretations lead to the same result for Lylah's current salary.

*   **Interpretation A (Maintaining the percentage difference):** If Adrien's current salary is 30% higher than Lylah's current salary.
    A_new = 1.30 * Lylah's current salary (L_new)
    $56,000 = 1.30 * L_new
    L_new = $56,000 / 1.30
    L_new ≈ $43,076.92

*   **Interpretation B (Applying the same percentage increase):** If Lylah's salary also increased by 40%.
    L_new = L_old * (1 + 0.40)
    L_new = ($40,000 / 1.30) * 1.40

**Blake's Distance:**
Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard football field. Each back-and-forth trip consists of running 100 yards to one end and 100 yards back to the starting point, which totals 200 yards per trip.

So, for 15 trips:
\[
\text{Distance Blake runs} = 15 \times 200 \text{ yards} = 3000 \text{ yards}
\]

**Kelly's Distance:**
Kelly runs back and forth once on the 100-yard field, which is:
\[
\text{Distance for 1 trip} = 200 \text{ yards}
\]

After that, she runs to the 40-yard line and back. The distance to the 40-yard line is 40 yards, and the distance back is also 40 yards, making it:
\[
\text{Distance for one round trip to the 40-yard line} = 40 + 40 = 80 \text{ yards}
\]

She does this 34 times, so:
\[
\text{Distance Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back} = 34 \times 80 \text{ yards} = 2720 \text{ yards}
\]

Now, we add the distance she ran initially (200 yards) to the distance she ran to the 40-yard line and back:
\[
\text{Total Distance Kelly runs} = 200 + 2720 = 2920 \text{ yards}
\]

**Finding the Difference:**
Now we can find out how much farther the winner runs than the loser. Blake ran 3000 yards, and Kelly ran 2920 yards.

The difference in distance is:
\[
\text{Difference} = 3000 - 2920 = 80 \text{ yards}
\]

Thus, the winner (Blake) runs 80 yards farther than the loser (Kelly).

- Total time for Team B = 60 seconds + 57 seconds + 54 seconds + 51 seconds
- Total time for Team B = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

Now we compare the total times:
- Team A's total time = 220 seconds
- Team B's total time = 222 seconds

To find out how many seconds Team A wins by, we subtract Team A's time from Team B's time:
- Time difference = Team B's time - Team A's time = 222 seconds - 220 seconds = 2 seconds.

Thus, the faster team (Team A) will win by **2 seconds**.",0.00283705,12.324910879135132,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,

gsm8k,gsm8k-186,TrustRoute,1,"To solve the problem, we need to break down the distribution of straw among the different types of rodents and set up an equation based on the total pieces of straw distributed.

1. **Rats**: 
   - Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage.
   - There are 3 cages of rats, so the total number of rats is \( 3r \).
   - Each rat receives 6 pieces of straw, so the total straw for rats is:
     \[
     \text{Straw for rats} = 3r \times 6 = 18r
     \]

2. **Hamsters**:
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster receives 5 pieces of straw.
   - Let \( h \) be the number of hamsters in each cage.
   - The total number of hamsters is \( 10h \).
   - The total straw for hamsters is:
     \[
     \text{Straw for hamsters} = 10h \times 5 = 50h
     \]

3. **Rabbits**:
   - The problem states that 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

4. **Total Straw Distributed**:
   - The total pieces of straw distributed among all rodents is given as 160 pieces. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     18r + 50h + 20 = 160
     \]

5. **Simplifying the Equation**:
   - Subtract 20 from both sides:
     \[
     18r + 50h = 140
     \]

6. **Finding Possible Values**:
   - We need to find integer values for \( r \) and \( h \) that satisfy this equation. We can express \( h \) in terms of \( r \):
     \[
     50h = 140 - 18r
     \]
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18r}{50}
     \]

   - For \( h \) to be an integer, \( 140 - 18r \) must be divisible by 50. We can check integer values for \( r \):

   - **Testing values for \( r \)**:
     - If \( r = 0 \):
       \[
       h = \frac{140 - 0}{50} = 2.8 \quad (\text{not an integer})
       \]
     - If \( r = 1 \):
       \[
       h = \frac{140 - 18}{50} = \frac{122}{50} = 2.44 \quad (\text{not an integer})
       \]
     - If \( r = 2 \):
       \[
       h = \frac{140 - 36}{50} = \frac{104}{50} = 2.08 \quad (\text{not an integer})
       \]
     - If \( r = 3 \):
       \[
       h = \frac{140 - 54}{50} = \frac{86}{50} = 1.72 \quad (\text{not an integer})
       \]
     - If \( r = 4 \):
       \[
       h = \frac{140 - 72}{50} = \frac{68}{50} = 1.36 \quad (\text{not an integer})
       \]
     - If \( r = 5 \):
       \[
       h = \frac{140 - 90}{50} = \frac{50}{50} = 1 \quad (\text{integer})
       \]
     - If \( r = 6 \):
       \[
       h = \frac{140 - 108}{50} = \frac{32}{50} = 0.64 \quad (\text{not an integer})
       \]
     - If \( r = 7 \):

       h = \frac{140 - 126}{50} = \frac{14}{50} = 0.28 \quad (\text{not an integer})

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The only integer solution found is when \( r = 5 \) and \( h = 1 \).

gsm8k,gsm8k-187,TrustRoute,1,"To calculate how much Mandy owes Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can use the formula for compound interest:

\[
A = P(1 + r)^n
\]

Where:
- \( A \) is the amount owed after \( n \) months,
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial amount owed),
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (as a decimal),
- \( n \) is the number of months.

In this case:
- \( P = 100 \) (the initial amount),
- \( r = 0.02 \) (2% as a decimal),
- \( n = 3 \) (the number of months).

Now, we can plug in the values:

\[
A = 100(1 + 0.02)^3
