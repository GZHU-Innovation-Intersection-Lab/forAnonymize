1. **Calculate the total number of eggs laid per day**: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.

2. **Calculate the number of eggs she uses**:
   - She eats 3 eggs for breakfast.
   - She uses 4 eggs for baking muffins.
   - Total eggs used = 3 (for breakfast) + 4 (for muffins) = 7 eggs.

1. The price of the first glass is \( \$5 \).
2. The price of every second glass is \( 60\% \) of \( \$5 \).

Calculating the price of the second glass:
\[

**Step 1: Set up the problem using the ratio**

If their ages are in the ratio 7:11, I can express their ages as:
- Darrell's age = 7x
- Allen's age = 11x

where x is a common multiplier.

**Step 2: Use the total age to find x**

Their total age is 162, so:
7x + 11x = 162
18x = 162
x = 162 ÷ 18
x = 9

**Step 3: Find Allen's current age**

Allen's current age = 11x = 11 × 9 = 99 years

**Step 4: Calculate Allen's age 10 years from now**

Allen's age in 10 years = 99 + 10 = 109 years

To find the number of trips, we divide his total budget by the cost of one trip:
\[ 
\text{Number of trips} = \frac{42}{14} 
\]

Calculating this gives:
\[ 
\text{Number of trips} = 3 
\]

**Given information:**
- Bridge weight limit: 5000 pounds
- Weight of each box: 15 pounds
- Weight of driver + empty truck: 3755 pounds

**Step-by-step solution:**

1) First, I'll find how much weight capacity is available for boxes:
   - Available capacity = Bridge limit - (Driver + Empty truck)
   - Available capacity = 5000 - 3755
   - Available capacity = 1245 pounds

2) Now I'll find the maximum number of boxes:
   - Number of boxes = Available capacity ÷ Weight per box
   - Number of boxes = 1245 ÷ 15
   - Number of boxes = 83

3) Let me verify this answer:
   - Total weight = 3755 + (83 × 15)
   - Total weight = 3755 + 1245
   - Total weight = 5000 pounds ✓

1. **Pension Amount**: Marcy's full pension amount after 40 years of service is $50,000 per year.

2. **Entitlement After 20 Years**: After 20 years, Marcy becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension for each year of service beyond 20 years.

3. **Years of Service**: Since Marcy quits after 30 years, she has worked for 10 years beyond the 20-year mark.

Now, let's calculate the pension entitlement:

- **Years Beyond 20**: 30 years - 20 years = 10 years
- **Percentage Accumulated**: 10 years × 5% = 50%

This means that after 30 years of service, Marcy is entitled to 50% of the full pension amount.

Now, we calculate her annual pension:

- **Annual Pension**: 50% of $50,000 = 0.50 × $50,000 = $25,000

gsm8k,gsm8k-88,TrustRoute,1,"Let M be the number of copies Marilyn's record sold.
Let H be the number of copies Harald's record sold.

From the problem statement, we can form two equations:

1.  Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's:
    M = 10 * H

2.  They sold 88,000 copies combined:
    M + H = 88,000

Now we can use the first equation to substitute for M in the second equation:
(10 * H) + H = 88,000

Combine the terms with H:
11 * H = 88,000

To find H, divide both sides of the equation by 11:
H = 88,000 / 11
H = 8,000

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

To verify, if Harald sold 8,000 copies, then Marilyn sold 10 * 8,000 = 80,000 copies.
Together, they sold 8,000 + 80,000 = 88,000 copies, which matches the problem statement.

1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the lumber:**
   - For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
     - Cost per board = $10
     - Number of boards = 10
     - Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100

   - For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
     - Cost per board = $16
     - Number of boards = 5
     - Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80

   - Total cost of all boards = Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards + Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards
   - Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180

2. **Calculate the selling price after the price increase:**
   - The price of lumber has increased by 50%. 
   - New price for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = $10 + (50% of $10) = $10 + $5 = $15
   - New price for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = $16 + (50% of $16) = $16 + $8 = $24

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the boards:**
   - For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
     - Selling price per board = $15
     - Total revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $15/board = $150

gsm8k,gsm8k-119,TrustRoute,1,"I need to find the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later.

**Given information:**
- Adrien's salary 4 years ago: $40,000
- Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's (4 years ago)
- 4 years later, Adrien earns 40% more than he did 4 years ago
- Both salaries increased simultaneously (by the same percentage)

**Step 1: Find Lylah's salary 4 years ago**

If Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's:
- Adrien = Lylah × 1.30
- $40,000 = Lylah × 1.30
- Lylah = $40,000 ÷ 1.30
- Lylah = $30,769.23 (approximately)

**Step 2: Find Adrien's salary 4 years later**

Adrien's new salary is 40% more than his old salary:
- Adrien (new) = $40,000 × 1.40
- Adrien (new) = $56,000

**Step 3: Find the percentage increase**

Since both salaries increased simultaneously (by the same percentage):
- Percentage increase = (56,000 - 40,000) ÷ 40,000 = 16,000 ÷ 40,000 = 0.40 = 40%

**Step 4: Find Lylah's salary 4 years later**

Lylah's salary also increased by 40%:
- Lylah (new) = $30,769.23 × 1.40
- Lylah (new) = $43,076.92 (approximately)

**Step 5: Calculate total salary 4 years later**

Total = Adrien (new) + Lylah (new)
Total = $56,000 + $43,076.92
Total = **$99,076.92**

Or more precisely, using exact fractions:
- Lylah (old) = 40,000/1.3 = 400,000/13
- Lylah (new) = (400,000/13) × 1.4 = 560,000/13
- Total = 56,000 + 560,000/13 = 728,000/13 + 560,000/13 = 1,288,000/13 ≈ **$99,076.92**

1 mile = 5280 feet.

- **Steve's distance**: 
  \[
  3 \text{ miles} = 3 \times 5280 \text{ feet} = 15840 \text{ feet}

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard football field. Each back-and-forth run covers a distance of:

\[
\text{Distance for one back-and-forth} = 100 \text{ yards (to the end)} + 100 \text{ yards (back)} = 200 \text{ yards}

1. Jenna's mom picked 20 apples.
2. Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom. Therefore, the number of apples Jenna picked is:
   \[
   \text{Jenna's apples} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Mom's apples} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
   \]

3. Now, we can find the total number of apples they both picked:
   \[

gsm8k,gsm8k-186,TrustRoute,1,"To find out how many rats are in each cage, let's break down the information given:

1. **Rats**: There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat receives 6 pieces of straw.
2. **Hamsters**: There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster receives 5 pieces of straw.
3. **Rabbits**: A total of 20 pieces of straw is distributed among the rabbits.

We know that the total amount of straw distributed is 160 pieces. We can set up an equation to represent the total straw used:

Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage.

### Step 1: Calculate the straw used for rats
Since there are 3 cages and each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, the total straw for rats is:
\[
\text{Straw for rats} = 3 \times r \times 6 = 18r
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the straw used for hamsters
Since there are 10 cages and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw, the total straw for hamsters is:
\[
\text{Straw for hamsters} = 10 \times h \times 5 = 50h
\]
where \( h \) is the number of hamsters in each cage.

### Step 3: Add the straw for rabbits
The total straw for rabbits is given as 20 pieces.

### Step 4: Set up the equation
Now we can set up the equation for the total straw distributed:
\[
18r + 50h + 20 = 160
\]

### Step 5: Simplify the equation
Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
18r + 50h = 140
\]

### Step 6: Solve for \( r \) and \( h \)
To find possible values for \( r \) and \( h \), we can express \( h \) in terms of \( r \):
\[
50h = 140 - 18r
\]
\[
h = \frac{140 - 18r}{50}
\]

### Step 7: Find integer solutions
Since \( h \) must be a non-negative integer, \( 140 - 18r \) must be non-negative and divisible by 50. 

Let's test integer values for \( r \):

- **If \( r = 0 \)**:
  \[
  h = \frac{140 - 0}{50} = 2.8 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
  \]

- **If \( r = 1 \)**:
  \[
  h = \frac{140 - 18}{50} = \frac{122}{50} = 2.44 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
  \]

- **If \( r = 2 \)**:
  \[
  h = \frac{140 - 36}{50} = \frac{104}{50} = 2.08 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
  \]

- **If \( r = 3 \)**:
  \[
  h = \frac{140 - 54}{50} = \frac{86}{50} = 1.72 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
  \]

- **If \( r = 4 \)**:
  \[
  h = \frac{140 - 72}{50} = \frac{68}{50} = 1.36 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
  \]

- **If \( r = 5 \)**:
  \[
  h = \frac{140 - 90}{50} = \frac{50}{50} = 1 \quad \text{(integer)}
  \]

- **If \( r = 6 \)**:
  \[
  h = \frac{140 - 108}{50} = \frac{32}{50} = 0.64 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
  \]

- **If \( r = 7 \)**:
  \[
  h = \frac{140 - 126}{50} = \frac{14}{50} = 0.28 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
  \]

### Conclusion
The only integer solution we found is when \( r = 5 \) and \( h = 1 \).

gsm8k,gsm8k-187,TrustRoute,1,"To calculate how much Mandy owes Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can use the formula for compound interest:

\[
A = P(1 + r)^n
\]

Where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money owed after \( n \) months,
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount owed),
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (as a decimal),
- \( n \) is the number of months.

In this case:
- \( P = 100 \) (the initial amount),
- \( r = 0.02 \) (2% as a decimal),
- \( n = 3 \) (the number of months).

Now, we can plug in the values:

\[
A = 100(1 + 0.02)^3
\]

Calculating \( (1 + 0.02)^3 \):

\[
(1 + 0.02)^3 = (1.02)^3 \approx 1.061208

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of bags of wheat the trader bought and sold.

2. **Calculate Costs**:
   - The cost to buy the wheat: \( 20x \) (since each bag costs $20).
   - The cost to transport the wheat: \( 2x \) (since it costs $2 to transport each bag).
   - Total cost: 
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = 20x + 2x = 22x
     \]

3. **Calculate Revenue**:
   - The selling price of the wheat: \( 30x \) (since each bag is sold for $30).
   - Total revenue: 
     \[
     \text{Total Revenue} = 30x
     \]

4. **Calculate Profit**:
   - Profit is defined as total revenue minus total cost:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost}
     \]
   - Substituting the expressions we have:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = 30x - 22x = 8x
     \]

5. **Set Up the Equation**:
   - We know the trader made a total profit of $400:

     8x = 400
     \]

6. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - Divide both sides by 8:
