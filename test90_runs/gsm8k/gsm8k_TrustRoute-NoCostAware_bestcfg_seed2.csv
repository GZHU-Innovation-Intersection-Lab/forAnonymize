gsm8k,gsm8k-211,TrustRoute-NoCostAware,2,"Let \( r \) be the number of red chickens and \( w \) be the number of white chickens. According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The number of white chickens is two more than the number of red chickens:
   \[
   w = r + 2
   \]

2. The total number of eggs collected from both types of chickens is 42:
   \[
   3r + 5w = 42
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( w \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[
3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
\]

Expanding this gives:

\[
3r + 5r + 10 = 42
\]

Combining like terms:

\[
8r + 10 = 42
\]

Next, we subtract 10 from both sides:

\[
8r = 32
\]

Now, divide both sides by 8:

\[
r = 4
\]

Now that we have the number of red chickens, we can find the number of white chickens:

\[
w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6
\]

Thus, Jerry has:

- **6 white chickens**

To verify, we can check the total number of eggs produced:

- Red chickens produce: \( 4 \times 3 = 12 \) eggs
- White chickens produce: \( 6 \times 5 = 30 \) eggs

Total eggs:

\[
12 + 30 = 42

   - Water type cards: 40

2. **Adjust for Losses and Purchases**:
   - After losing 8 water type cards:

3. **Extra cheese**: $1.00
4. **Avocado**: $1.00
5. **Sauces (2 at $0.25 each)**: \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\)
6. **Meal upgrade**: $3.00

Now, let's add all these costs together:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 6.50 + 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 + 3.00
\]

Calculating this step by step:

2. **Fries taken by Kyle**: Kyle took 5 fries.
   - Remaining fries for Griffin: \( 24 - 5 = 19 \) fries.
3. **Fries taken by Billy**: Billy took twice as many as Kyle.
   - Since Kyle took 5 fries, Billy took \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) fries.
   - Remaining fries for Griffin: \( 19 - 10 = 9 \) fries.
4. **Fries taken by Colby**: Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken.

From the problem, we have the following two equations based on the information given:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
   \[
   R = 6S
   \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
   \[
   R + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation. 

Substituting \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
\]

Now, simplify the right side:
\[
6S + 9 = 3S + 27
\]

Next, we can isolate \( S \) by moving all terms involving \( S \) to one side and constant terms to the other side:
\[
6S - 3S = 27 - 9
\]
\[
3S = 18
\]

Now, divide both sides by 3:

S = 6

So, Sam is currently **6 years old**.

To find Ruby's age, we can substitute \( S \) back into the equation for \( R \):

R = 6S = 6 \times 6 = 36

Thus, Ruby is currently **36 years old**.

To verify, in 9 years:
- Sam will be \( 6 + 9 = 15 \)

According to the problem:

1. The number of players on the offense is \( 2d \) (twice as many as on defense).
2. The number of players on special teams is \( \frac{d}{2} \) (half the number of players on defense).

The total number of members in the team is given as 105. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
d + 2d + \frac{d}{2} = 105
\]

Now, combine the terms on the left side:

\[
3d + \frac{d}{2} = 105
\]

To combine \( 3d \) and \( \frac{d}{2} \), we can express \( 3d \) as \( \frac{6d}{2} \):

\[
\frac{6d}{2} + \frac{d}{2} = 105
\]

Now, combine the fractions:

\[
\frac{6d + d}{2} = 105
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{7d}{2} = 105
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 2:

\[
7d = 210

gsm8k,gsm8k-357,TrustRoute-NoCostAware,2,"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite to her birthday party, we need to calculate the total cost for Morgan and her friends based on the activities they want to do.

1. **Cost of mini-golf**:
   - Each round of mini-golf costs $5.
   - If Morgan invites \( f \) friends, the total number of participants (including Morgan) is \( f + 1 \).
   - Therefore, the total cost for mini-golf is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of mini-golf} = 5 \times (f + 1)
     \]

2. **Cost of arcade tokens**:
   - Each person gets $5 in arcade tokens.
   - The total cost for arcade tokens is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of arcade tokens} = 5 \times (f + 1)
     \]

3. **Cost of go-karts**:
   - Each ride on the go-karts costs $10, and each person rides twice.
   - Therefore, the total cost for go-karts is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of go-karts} = 10 \times 2 \times (f + 1) = 20 \times (f + 1)
     \]

4. **Total cost**:
   - The total cost for all activities is the sum of the costs calculated above:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of mini-golf} + \text{Cost of arcade tokens} + \text{Cost of go-karts}
     \]
   - Substituting the costs:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 5(f + 1) + 5(f + 1) + 20(f + 1)
     \]
   - Simplifying this:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = (5 + 5 + 20)(f + 1) = 30(f + 1)
     \]

5. **Setting up the budget equation**:
   - Morgan has a budget of $90, so we set up the equation:
     \[
     30(f + 1) \leq 90
     \]

6. **Solving for \( f \)**:
   - Dividing both sides by 30:
     \[
     f + 1 \leq 3

2. He completed half of his steps on his walks to and from school. This means he walked \( \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \) steps.
3. He did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
4. After these activities, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal.

Now, let's calculate the total steps he had taken before his jog:

- Steps from school: 5,000
- Steps from the walk with his friend: 1,000

Total steps before the jog:
\[
5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 \text{ steps}

Since he has a goal of 10,000 steps and he has 2,000 steps left after his jog, we can find out how many steps he took during his jog.

The total steps he has taken plus the steps left should equal his goal:
\[
\text{Total steps taken} + \text{Steps left} = 10,000

According to the problem:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- She gathers half of that from the shortest trees, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
- Therefore, the total number of apples Joanne gathers is:
  \[
  30 + 15 + x = 45 + x

Now, let's analyze how many apples her sister gathers:

- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is:

- She gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is:

Let:
- \( c \) = number of camels
- \( d \) = number of dromedaries

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. Each animal has one head, so the total number of heads gives us the equation:
   \[
   c + d = 180
   \]

2. Camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump, so the total number of humps gives us the equation:
   \[
   2c + d = 304
   \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)  (Equation 1)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \)  (Equation 2)

We can solve this system step by step.

First, we can solve Equation 1 for \( d \):
\[
d = 180 - c
\]

Next, we substitute this expression for \( d \) into Equation 2:
\[
2c + (180 - c) = 304
\]

Now, simplify the equation:
\[
2c + 180 - c = 304
\]
\[
c + 180 = 304
\]
\[
c = 304 - 180
\]
\[
c = 124
\]

Now that we have the number of camels, we can find the number of dromedaries using Equation 1:
\[
d = 180 - c = 180 - 124 = 56
\]

Thus, the number of dromedaries is \( \boxed{56} \).",0.00268045,17.262327671051025,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,

2. **Next 2 Days:**
   - He traveled only 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days over these 2 days.
   - Distance for the first 4 days = 800 km.
   - 30% of 800 km = \( 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \).
   - Since this distance is covered over 2 days, the distance for these 2 days is 240 km.

3. **Next Day (Day 7):**
   - On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for this day = 0 km.

4. **Second Week (Days 8 to 14):**
   - He traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days.
   - Distance for the second week = \( 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \).

- Distance for the first 4 days: 800 km
- Distance for the next 2 days: 240 km

1. **Cost of the bagel**: 
   - The bagel costs $4.

2. **Cost of the soup**: 
   - The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. 
   - 25% of the bagel's cost: \( 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \).
   - Therefore, the cost of the soup is: \( 4 + 1 = 5 \).

3. **Cost of the cake**: 
   - The cake costs half of the price of the bagel.
   - Half of the bagel's cost: \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \).

Now, we can add the costs of all three items together:

- Cost of the bagel: $4
- Cost of the soup: $5
- Cost of the cake: $2

   \[
   \text{Cards sold} = \frac{2}{3}x

2. **Money from Selling Cards**: Each card is sold for $1.5, so the total money he makes from selling the cards is:
   \[

1. **Convert the lengths to the same unit**: 
   - The shark's length is 10 feet. 
   - The remoras are 6 inches each. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert the shark's length to inches:

4. **Top Layer (1 girl)**: The top cheerleader is the shortest one, who is 60 inches tall:
   \[

Now, we need to calculate the total height of the pyramid. The height of each layer is stacked on top of each other, so we add them together:

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. \( L + D + B = 43 \) (the total number of insects)
2. \( L = D + 7 \) (Lily found 7 more than David)
3. \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \) (David found half of what Bodhi found)

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( L \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \) into the first equation.

First, from equation 3, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( D \):
\[
B = 2D
\]

Now substitute \( B \) into the first equation:
\[
L + D + 2D = 43
\]
\[
L + 3D = 43
\]

Next, substitute \( L \) from equation 2 into this equation:

\[

Now, solve for \( D \):

2. **Cousin's Age in 8 Years**: 
   Let \( x \) be the current age of Jame's cousin. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be:

1. **Total Days in April**: April has 30 days.
2. **Days in Each Half**: The first half consists of 15 days (April 1 to April 15) and the second half consists of 15 days (April 16 to April 30).
3. **Monthly Saving Target**: Elvis's target is $1125.

Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of the month. Therefore, in the first half, he saves:

\[
\text{Total savings in the first half} = 15x
\]

In the second half of the month, he wants to save twice as much daily, which means he will save \( 2x \) each day. Thus, in the second half, he saves:

\[
\text{Total savings in the second half} = 15(2x) = 30x
\]

Now, we can set up the equation for his total savings for the month:

\[
15x + 30x = 1125
\]

Combining the terms gives:

\[
45x = 1125
\]

Now, we can solve for \( x \):

   - Now, we can calculate how many pages she read in 105 minutes:
     \[
     \text{Pages read in the first week} = \text{Pages per minute} \times \text{Total minutes} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \times 105 \text{ minutes} = 140 \text{ pages}.

gsm8k,gsm8k-633,TrustRoute-NoCostAware,2,"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we can set up the problem using their speeds and the distance between them.

1. **Identify the speeds and distance:**
   - Bob's speed = 55 miles per hour
   - Tom's speed = 70 miles per hour
   - Distance ahead = 75 miles

2. **Calculate the relative speed:**
   The relative speed is the difference in their speeds since Tom is trying to catch up to Bob.
   \[

gsm8k,gsm8k-635,TrustRoute-NoCostAware,2,"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we first need to calculate the maximum total cost per class that his parents are willing to pay.

1. **Total cost of classes**: Manny signed up for classes for $60.
2. **Maximum cost per class**: His parents are willing to pay a maximum of $10 per class.

Now, we can calculate the maximum number of classes he can attend while keeping the cost per class at or below $10.

3. **Total number of classes**: 10 classes.
4. **Maximum total cost allowed**: \( 10 \text{ classes} \times 10 \text{ dollars/class} = 100 \text{ dollars} \).

Since Manny's classes cost $60, we can find out how many classes he can miss:

5. **Cost per class if he attends all 10**: 
   \[
   \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60 \text{ dollars}}{10 \text{ classes}} = 6 \text{ dollars/class}
   \]
   This is below the $10 threshold.

6. **Calculating how many classes he can miss**: 
   Let \( x \) be the number of classes he attends. The cost per class when he attends \( x \) classes is:
   \[
   \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{x}
   \]
   We want this to be greater than or equal to $10:
   \[
   \frac{60}{x} \leq 10
   \]

   Rearranging gives:
   \[
   60 \leq 10x
   \]
   \[
   6 \leq x
   \]

   This means Manny must attend at least 6 classes.

7. **Calculating the number of classes he can miss**:
   Since there are 10 total classes:
   \[
   \text{Classes he can miss} = 10 - x
   \]
   If \( x \) is at least 6, then:
   \[
   \text{Classes he can miss} = 10 - 6 = 4

1. **Cost of the plane**: 
   - The plane costs $150,000.

2. **Monthly expenses**:
   - Hanger rental: $5,000 per month.
   - Fuel cost: Twice the hanger rental, which is \(2 \times 5,000 = 10,000\) per month.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length. This means the length added is:

\[
0.5x

After adding this extension, the length of the dress becomes:

\[
x + 0.5x = 1.5x
\]

Next, she adds 20 cm for the lace trim, making the total length of the dress:

We know that the final design of the dress is 140 cm long. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[

Now, we will solve for \( x \):

1. Subtract 20 from both sides:

1. **Determine the percentage of the river's water used by Colorado City**: 
   Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.

2. **Determine the percentage of that water used for industrial purposes**: 
   Out of the 40% that Colorado City uses, 80% is for industrial purposes.

1. **Initial Stickers**:
   - Lorraine starts with:
     - Small stickers: 30
     - Large stickers: 40

2. **Trading Small Stickers**:
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = \( 0.9 \times 30 = 27 \) small stickers.
   - Therefore, she has \( 30 - 27 = 3 \) small stickers left.

   - Each large sticker is worth 1 large button or 3 small buttons. Since she trades small stickers for large buttons, we need to convert small stickers to large buttons:
     - 27 small stickers = \( \frac{27}{3} = 9 \) large buttons.

3. **Trading Large Stickers**:
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = \( 0.5 \times 40 = 20 \) large stickers.
   - Therefore, she has \( 40 - 20 = 20 \) large stickers left.

   - Each large sticker is worth 1 large button, so:
     - 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons.

4. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers**:
   - Lorraine trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so:
     - 20 large stickers = \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons.

5. **Total Buttons**:
   - Now, let's sum up all the buttons Lorraine has:
     - From small stickers traded for large buttons: 9 large buttons
     - From large stickers traded for large buttons: 20 large buttons
     - From large stickers traded for small buttons: 60 small buttons

   - Total buttons:

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The total number of cases needed for all three houses is:
   \[
   x + y + z = 250

2. The first house needs half of what the second house needs:
   \[
   x = \frac{1}{2}y
   \]

3. The third house needs double what the first house needs:
   \[
   z = 2x
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( x \) and \( z \) in terms of \( y \) into the total equation.

First, substitute \( x = \frac{1}{2}y \) into \( z = 2x \):
\[
z = 2\left(\frac{1}{2}y\right) = y
\]

Now we can substitute \( x \) and \( z \) into the total equation:
\[
\frac{1}{2}y + y + y = 250
\]

Combine the terms:
\[
\frac{1}{2}y + 2y = 250
\]
\[
\frac{1}{2}y + \frac{4}{2}y = 250
\]
\[
\frac{5}{2}y = 250

- \( S \): amount of salt
- \( O \): amount of oil
- \( F \): amount of fragrance
- \( Z \): amount of citrus zest
- \( G \): amount of sugar

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. \( Z = F \) (the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance)
2. \( S = G \) (the same amount of salt as sugar)
3. \( O = 2S \) (twice as much oil as salt)
4. \( S = 2Z \) (twice as much salt as zest)

We also know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces:

\[
S + O + F + Z + G = 10
\]

Now, we can express everything in terms of \( Z \):

1. From \( Z = F \), we have \( F = Z \).
2. From \( S = 2Z \), we have \( S = 2Z \).
3. From \( G = S \), we have \( G = 2Z \).
4. From \( O = 2S \), we have \( O = 2(2Z) = 4Z \).

Now we can substitute these expressions into the total equation:

\[
S + O + F + Z + G = 10
\]
\[
2Z + 4Z + Z + Z + 2Z = 10
\]

Combining like terms:

\[
10Z = 10
\]

Now, solving for \( Z \):

\[
Z = 1
\]

Now we can find the amounts of the other ingredients:

- \( F = Z = 1 \)
- \( S = 2Z = 2 \)
- \( G = S = 2 \)
- \( O = 4Z = 4 \)

Thus, the amount of oil \( O \) that Tanya uses is:

gsm8k,gsm8k-825,TrustRoute-NoCostAware,2,"Let's denote the number of cards that PJ has as \( p \). According to the problem:

1. Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so we can express Smendrick's cards as:
   \[
   s = 3p
   \]

2. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, which can be expressed as:
   \[
   b = s + 12 = 3p + 12
   \]

3. The total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   b + s + p = 341
   \]

Now, substituting the expressions for \( b \) and \( s \) in terms of \( p \) into the total equation:
\[
(3p + 12) + (3p) + p = 341
\]

Combining like terms:
\[
3p + 12 + 3p + p = 341
\]
\[
7p + 12 = 341
\]

Next, we subtract 12 from both sides:
\[
7p = 341 - 12
\]
\[
7p = 329
\]

Now, divide both sides by 7 to find \( p \):
\[
p = \frac{329}{7} = 47
\]

Now that we have \( p \), we can find \( s \) and \( b \):
\[
s = 3p = 3 \times 47 = 141
\]
\[
b = 3p + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153

   - Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.

2. **Saskay's lifting ability**: 
   - Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
   - Therefore, Saskay can lift: 
     \[
     12 \times 1 \text{ inch} = 12 \text{ inches}

3. **Kagiyami's lifting ability**: 
   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.

1. **Determine the distance traveled by the kangaroos:**
   - If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway, we can denote the speed of a kangaroo as \( v \).
   - The distance \( d \) that they travel can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     d = \text{speed} \times \text{time}
     \]
   - Since all 3 kangaroos travel together at speed \( v \), the distance is:
     \[
     d = v \times 18 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of a turtle is:
     \[
     \text{Speed of a turtle} = \frac{v}{2}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time it takes for the turtles to travel the same distance:**
   - We need to find the time \( t \) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( d \). The formula for distance is still applicable:
     \[
     d = \text{speed of turtles} \times \text{time}
     \]
   - The combined speed of 4 turtles is:
     \[
     \text{Combined speed of 4 turtles} = 4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v
     \]
   - Now we can set up the equation for the distance:
     \[
     d = 2v \times t
     \]

4. **Set the two expressions for distance equal to each other:**
   \[
   v \times 18 = 2v \times t

1. **Time for each group:**
   - Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
   - Time to perform: 6 minutes
   - Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes

   Total time for each group = 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes

2. **Intermission:**
   - There is a 10-minute intermission.

3. **Total concert time:**
   - The concert is 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes.

4. **Time available for performances:**
   - Since there is a 10-minute intermission, the time available for performances is:
   
   \( 120 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 110 \text{ minutes} \)

5. **Calculating the number of groups:**
   - To find out how many groups can perform, we divide the total performance time by the time each group takes:

3. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn:
   \[

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) into the total books equation.

First, substitute \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the equation for \( S \):
\[
S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13

   - Total cost of bacon = $10.

2. **Cost of chicken**:
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Since 5 packs of bacon cost $10, the cost of one pack of bacon is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of one pack of bacon} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars}

gsm8k,gsm8k-894,TrustRoute-NoCostAware,2,"Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \).

According to the problem:

1. Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as she did Joe's, which means she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.
2. The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's, which means she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.

Now, we need to calculate how much Tasha earned from mowing lawns.

- Joe paid Tasha $6 for mowing his lawn, so from Joe, she earned:
  \[
  \text{Earnings from Joe} = 6
  \]

- We don't know how much Kamala and Alba paid her per mowing, so let's denote:
  - The payment from Kamala for each mowing as \( k \).
  - The payment from Alba for each mowing as \( a \).

Now, we can express Tasha's total earnings from mowing lawns as:
\[
\text{Total earnings from mowing} = 6 + (3x \cdot k) + (5x \cdot a)
\]

We know that Tasha made a total of $80 from both lemonade sales and mowing lawns. Therefore, we can express this as:
\[
\text{Total earnings from mowing} + \text{Earnings from lemonade} = 80
\]

Let \( L \) be the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales. Then we have:
\[
6 + (3x \cdot k) + (5x \cdot a) + L = 80
\]

To find \( L \), we need to isolate it:
\[
L = 80 - (6 + (3x \cdot k) + (5x \cdot a))
\]
\[
L = 74 - (3x \cdot k + 5x \cdot a)
\]

Since we don't have specific values for \( k \) and \( a \), we cannot determine the exact amount Tasha made from lemonade sales without additional information about how much Kamala and Alba paid her. 

However, if we assume that Tasha only mowed Joe's lawn (i.e., \( x = 1 \)), she would have made $6 from Joe, and the remaining $74 would be from lemonade sales. 

Thus, without further information about the payments from Kamala and Alba, we can conclude that Tasha made at least $74 from lemonade sales, but the exact amount cannot be determined without knowing \( k \) and \( a \). 

If we assume \( k \) and \( a \) are such that Tasha's total earnings from mowing are minimized, then:
\[
L = 74
\]

So, Tasha made at least **$74 from lemonade sales**.",0.00890865,26.262797117233276,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_confidence,

   \[
   P + A + J = 100

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   A = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = A + J
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( P \) into the first equation.

First, substitute \( A = J + 10 \) into the equation for \( P \):
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now substitute \( P \) and \( A \) into the combined age equation:

Combine like terms:

   \[
   B + A + D = 45

2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo:
   \[
   B = A + 20
   \]

3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar:
   \[
   B = D + 10

Now, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):

From the second equation:
\[
A = B - 20
\]

From the third equation:
\[
D = B - 10
\]

Now, we can substitute \( A \) and \( D \) into the total points equation:

\[
B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45
\]

Simplifying this equation:
\[
B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45

\[

Now, we add this amount to the cost of the supplies to find the total cost of the tickets:
\[

gsm8k,gsm8k-963,TrustRoute-NoCostAware,2,"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe as \( A \), \( S \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem statement, we have the following equations:

1. \( A + S + D = 339 \) (the total number of Pokemon caught)
2. \( A = S + 5 \) (Alex has caught 5 more than Stan)
3. \( S = 4D - 13 \) (Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times what Adelwolfe has caught)

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( S \) from equations 2 and 3 into equation 1.

Substituting \( A \) from equation 2 into equation 1:

\[
(S + 5) + S + D = 339
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2S + D + 5 = 339
\]

Subtracting 5 from both sides gives:

\[
2S + D = 334 \quad \text{(Equation 4)}
\]

Next, we substitute \( S \) from equation 3 into equation 4:

\[
2(4D - 13) + D = 334
\]

Expanding this gives:

\[
8D - 26 + D = 334
\]

Combining like terms results in:

\[
9D - 26 = 334
\]

Adding 26 to both sides:

\[
9D = 360
\]

Dividing by 9:

\[
D = 40
\]

Now that we have \( D \), we can find \( S \) using equation 3:

\[
S = 4D - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
\]

Finally, we can find \( A \) using equation 2:

\[
A = S + 5 = 147 + 5 = 152
\]

To verify, we check the total:

\[
A + S + D = 152 + 147 + 40 = 339
\]

Everything checks out. Therefore, the number of Pokemon Stan has caught is:

1. **First Segment (South)**:
   - Time: 10 hours

   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 10 hours = 300 miles

2. **Second Segment (North)**:
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 miles/hour × 2 hours = 36 miles

3. **Third Segment (South)**:
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 22 miles/hour × 5 hours = 110 miles

Now, we will calculate the net distance traveled south:

- Total distance traveled south = Distance from the first segment + Distance from the third segment
  - Total distance south = 300 miles + 110 miles = 410 miles

- Distance traveled north = Distance from the second segment
  - Total distance north = 36 miles

- Let \( x \) be the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time.
- Let \( y \) be the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet for the first time, which is 30 years old.

Since Halley's Comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we can determine the timeline of events as follows:

1. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
2. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. Since his father was 30 years old when he first saw the comet, we can express this as:
   - Bill's age when he saw the comet the second time = \( 3 \times 30 = 90 \) years old.

Now, we need to find out how many years passed between the first and second sightings of the comet. Since Halley's Comet appears every 75 years, the time between the two sightings is 75 years.

Now, we can set up the equation based on the ages:

- When Bill saw the comet for the second time, he was \( x + 75 \) years old (since 75 years passed since he first saw it).
- We know from the previous calculation that he was 90 years old when he saw it the second time.

So we can set up the equation:

\[
x + 75 = 90

According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. Therefore, the number of flights to Greece is:

\[
\frac{3}{4}x
\]

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. The number of flights remaining after those to Greece is:

\[
x - \frac{3}{4}x = \frac{1}{4}x
\]

Since these remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{4}x \right) = \frac{1}{8}x
\]

Now, we also know that the second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
44 = \frac{1}{2}x
\]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

\[
x = 88

Now that we have the total number of flights for the first plane, we can find the number of flights to France:

\[

We know the total age of the children is 20 years:

\[
A + B + C + D = 20

Substituting the known ages of Akbar and Alessandro:

\[
3 + 4 + C + D = 20
\]

This simplifies to:

Next, we know that Helene's age \( C \) is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the four children is:

Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since there are 4 kids, the total size of the slices for the kids is:

\[
4x
\]

Each adult receives a slice that is twice the size of a kid's slice, so each adult's slice is:

\[
2x
\]

Since there are 2 adults, the total size of the slices for the adults is:

Now, we can find the total size of the watermelon by adding the total size of the slices for the adults and the kids:

\[

Simplifying this:

\[

2. **Cost of Pears**: 
   - He bought 4 pears at $0.50 each.
   - Total cost for pears = \( 4 \times 0.50 = 2.00 \)

3. **Cost of Kiwis**:

1. Probability of having a substitute teacher:  
   \( P(\text{sub}) = 0.5 \)  
   Probability of turning in homework = \( 0 \)

2. Probability of having the normal teacher:  
   \( P(\text{normal}) = 0.5 \)

   - Probability of getting an extension:  
     \( P(\text{extension}) = 0.4 \)  
     Probability of turning in homework = \( 0 \)

   - Probability of not getting an extension:  
     \( P(\text{no extension}) = 0.6 \)

     - Probability of convincing the teacher:  
       \( P(\text{convince}) = 0.2 \)  
       Probability of turning in homework = \( 0 \)

     - Probability of not convincing the teacher:  
       \( P(\text{not convince}) = 0.8 \)  
       Probability of turning in homework = \( 1 \)

Now we can calculate the total probability of turning in homework when the normal teacher is present:

\[
P(\text{turn in | normal}) = P(\text{no extension}) \times P(\text{not convince}) = 0.6 \times 0.8 = 0.48
\]

Now we combine the probabilities:

\[
P(\text{turn in}) = P(\text{sub}) \times 0 + P(\text{normal}) \times P(\text{turn in | normal}) 
\]
\[
P(\text{turn in}) = 0.5 \times 0 + 0.5 \times 0.48 = 0.24
\]

Thus, the total probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 24%.

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is **24%**.",0.0049149499999999995,23.72231411933899,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,

- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.

The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is given as 19. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Now, let's simplify this equation step by step.

1. Combine like terms:
   \[
   2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
   \]

2. To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 2:
   \[
   2(2x + 4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2 \times 19

   This simplifies to:
   \[
   4x + 8 + x = 38

3. Combine the \( x \) terms:
   \[
   5x + 8 = 38

2. **Determine how many slices Jake ate**: 
   - According to the problem, Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake. 
   - Therefore, if Becky ate 10 slices, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \text{Becky} = \text{Jake} + 3
     \]
     Substituting Becky's slices:
     \[
     10 = \text{Jake} + 3

1. **Maggie's initial amount**: 
   - Maggie had $60.
   - She spent a quarter of her money: 
     \[
     \text{Amount spent by Maggie} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15
     \]
   - Therefore, the amount of money Maggie has left is:

Since the total amount of fence is 100 feet, we can set up the following equation:

\[
S + H = 100
\]

Substituting the expression for \( H \) into the equation gives us:

\[
S + (S + 60) = 100
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2S + 60 = 100

   - Current salary = $100,000
   - Annual retirement needs = 40% of $100,000 = 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000.

2. **Calculate total retirement savings needed for 20 years**:
   - Total retirement savings needed = Annual retirement needs * Number of retirement years.
   - Total retirement savings needed = $40,000 * 20 = $800,000.

3. **Determine how much Lauren saves each year**:
   - Lauren saves 20% of her paycheck.
   - Annual savings = 20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000.

4. **Calculate how many years Lauren needs to save to reach her retirement goal**:
   - Total savings needed = $800,000.
   - Years needed to save = Total savings needed / Annual savings.
   - Years needed to save = $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

We know the following:
- She walks 2 miles on the beach.
- She walks 1 mile on the sidewalk.
- She spends 40 minutes on the beach.

First, we need to convert the time spent on the beach into hours because the speeds are in miles per hour. 

\[
40 \text{ minutes} = \frac{40}{60} \text{ hours} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ hours}
\]

Now, we can calculate her speed on the beach using the distance and time:

\]

Now that we know her speed on the beach is \( 3 \) miles per hour, we can find her speed on the sidewalk:

\[
\text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2v = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk:

\[
\text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{6 \text{ miles per hour}} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ hours}

Now, we convert this time into minutes:

\[
\frac{1}{6} \text{ hours} = \frac{1}{6} \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 10 \text{ minutes}

Finally, we can find the total time for her entire walk:

According to the problem, if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) marbles. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
x + 24 = 60
\]

To find \( x \), we can subtract 24 from both sides:

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles.

Now, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, we can calculate how many he will have left:

gsm8k,gsm8k-1137,TrustRoute-NoCostAware,2,"To determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug, we can use the concept of the weighted average temperature of the mixed water.

Let \( T \) be the temperature of the water in the second mug. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug, the total volume of water he has is:

\[
4 \text{ ounces} + 1 \text{ ounce} = 5 \text{ ounces}
\]

The total temperature of the mixed water can be calculated using the formula for the average temperature:

\[
\text{Average Temperature} = \frac{\text{Total Heat}}{\text{Total Volume}}
\]

The total heat from the two mugs is:

\[
\text{Heat from 33-degree mug} = 4 \text{ ounces} \times 33 \text{ degrees} = 132 \text{ degree-ounces}
\]
\[
\text{Heat from second mug} = 1 \text{ ounce} \times T \text{ degrees} = T \text{ degree-ounces}
\]

Thus, the total heat is:

\[
132 + T \text{ degree-ounces}
\]

Now, we can set up the equation for the average temperature:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

To find \( T \), we multiply both sides by 5:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Now, we isolate \( T \):

\[
T \geq 200 - 132
\]
\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug must be at least **68 degrees** for Donny to be able to drink the water.",0.00315415,12.505967378616333,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,

- Let \( r \) be the length of the red rope.
- Let \( b \) be the length of the blue rope.
- Let \( y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope:
   \[
   r = 4b
   \]

2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope:
   \[
   b = y - 7
   \]

3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters:
   \[
   r + b + y = 37
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( r \) and \( b \) into the combined length equation.

Substituting \( r = 4b \) into the combined length equation:
\[
4b + b + y = 37
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
5b + y = 37
\]

Next, we can substitute \( b = y - 7 \) into the equation \( 5b + y = 37 \):
\[
5(y - 7) + y = 37
\]
Expanding this gives:
\[
5y - 35 + y = 37
\]
Combining like terms results in:
\[
6y - 35 = 37
\]
Adding 35 to both sides:
\[
6y = 72
\]
Dividing by 6:
\[
y = 12
\]

Now that we have the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
\[
b = y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5
\]

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope:
\[
r = 4b = 4 \times 5 = 20

1. **Mattison's Height**: 
   - Mattison is 60 inches tall.

2. **Height of the Two-Story House**: 
   - The height of the two-story house is 7 times Mattison's height.
   - Height of the house = 7 × 60 inches = 420 inches.

3. **Height of the First Floor**: 
   - The height from the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is 3 times Mattison's height.
   - Height of the first floor = 3 × 60 inches = 180 inches.

4. **Height of the Second Floor**: 
   - The height of the second floor can be calculated by subtracting the height of the first floor from the total height of the house.
   - Height of the second floor = Total height of the house - Height of the first floor
   - Height of the second floor = 420 inches - 180 inches = 240 inches.

5. **Height from the Second Floor's Floor to the Roof**: 
   - The height from the second floor's floor to the roof is simply the height of the second floor.

\[
b = 3c - 2
\]

Carly's class has 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats. Therefore, the total number of treats is:

\[
5 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ treats/person} = 10 \text{ treats}
\]

Since the total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies, we can write the equation:

\[
c + b = 10
\]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( b \) into this equation:

\[
c + (3c - 2) = 10
\]

Simplifying this gives:

\[
c + 3c - 2 = 10
\]
\[
4c - 2 = 10
\]

Next, we add 2 to both sides:

\[
4c = 12

Thus, Carly made \( \boxed{3} \) cupcakes.

To find the number of brownies, we can substitute \( c \) back into the equation for \( b \):

\[
b = 3(3) - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7
\]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes and 7 brownies, which adds up to:

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of making one jar

1. **Cost of passion fruit**:
   - Amount needed: 2 pounds
   - Cost per pound: $6
   - Total cost for passion fruit: \( 2 \, \text{pounds} \times 6 \, \text{dollars/pound} = 12 \, \text{dollars} \)

2. **Cost of jackfruit**:
   - Amount needed: 1.5 pounds
   - Cost per pound: $8
   - Total cost for jackfruit: \( 1.5 \, \text{pounds} \times 8 \, \text{dollars/pound} = 12 \, \text{dollars} \)

3. **Cost of special honey**:
   - Amount needed: 2 pounds
   - Cost per pound: $10
   - Total cost for honey: \( 2 \, \text{pounds} \times 10 \, \text{dollars/pound} = 20 \, \text{dollars} \)

### Step 2: Total cost for one jar
Now, we sum the costs of all ingredients to find the total cost for one jar:
\[
\text{Total cost for one jar} = \text{Cost of passion fruit} + \text{Cost of jackfruit} + \text{Cost of honey}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost for one jar} = 12 + 12 + 20 = 44 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost for 10 jars
\[
\text{Total cost for 10 jars} = 10 \times \text{Total cost for one jar} = 10 \times 44 = 440 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total revenue from selling 10 jars
The selling price for each jar is $50:
\[
\text{Total revenue from 10 jars} = 10 \times 50 = 500 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the profit
Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total costs:

However, Igor gathered:

- Half the number of test tubes: \( T = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \)
- Two more than the number of Petri dishes requested: \( P = 14 + 2 = 16 \)
- The correct number of beakers: \( B = 7 \)

1. **Understanding Speeds**:
   - Let \( v \) be Vanessa's speed in miles per minute.
   - Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Aaron's speed is \( 2v \).

2. **Distance and Time for Aaron**:
   - We know that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. 
   - The distance he ran can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
     \]
   - Therefore, the distance Aaron ran is:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_{\text{Aaron}} = 2v \times 16 = 32v \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Distance and Time for Vanessa**:
   - We are told that Vanessa ran 4 miles. 
   - We can find out how long it took Vanessa to run her 4 miles using her speed \( v \):
     \[
     \text{Time}_{\text{Vanessa}} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{4}{v} \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Finding the Relationship Between Distances**:
   - The problem states that Vanessa can run twice as far as Aaron. Since Aaron ran \( 32v \) miles, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     4 = 32v \cdot 2
     \]
   - This means that the distance Vanessa ran (4 miles) is equal to twice the distance Aaron ran. However, we need to clarify the distances:
     - If Aaron ran \( d_A \) miles, then Vanessa ran \( 2d_A \) miles.
     - Since we know Vanessa ran 4 miles, we can set \( 2d_A = 4 \), which gives \( d_A = 2 \) miles.

5. **Finding Aaron's Speed**:
   - If Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes, we can find his speed:
     \[
     \text{Speed}_{\text{Aaron}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{8} \text{ miles per minute}
     \]
   - Therefore, Vanessa's speed \( v \) is half of Aaron's speed:
     \[
     v = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute}
     \]

6. **Calculating Vanessa's Time**:
   - Now we can calculate how long it took Vanessa to run 4 miles:
     \[
     \text{Time}_{\text{Vanessa}} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{\frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute}} = 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ minutes}

1. **Calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour:**
   - Ana takes 3 minutes to peel one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - The number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour is given by:
     \[
     \text{Number of oranges peeled by Ana} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour:**
   - Jane takes 4 minutes to peel one orange.
   - The number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour is given by:
     \[
     \text{Number of oranges peeled by Jane} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges}
     \]

3. **Determine how many more oranges Ana has peeled than Jane:**
   - The difference in the number of oranges peeled is:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Oranges peeled by Ana} - \text{Oranges peeled by Jane} = 20 - 15 = 5

1. **Cost of the radiator:**
   - Original cost of the radiator: $400
   - Discount: 80% off
   - Amount paid for the radiator: 
     \[
     \text{Amount paid} = \text{Original cost} \times (1 - \text{Discount})
     \]
     \[
     \text{Amount paid} = 400 \times (1 - 0.80) = 400 \times 0.20 = 80

2. **Cost of the mechanic's labor:**
   - Hourly rate: $50
   - Time taken: 3 hours
   - Total labor cost:
     \[
     \text{Total labor cost} = \text{Hourly rate} \times \text{Time}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total labor cost} = 50 \times 3 = 150

gsm8k,gsm8k-1317,TrustRoute-NoCostAware,2,"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( W \).

We have two equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of animals:
   \[
   C + W = 20
   \]

2. The total number of legs:
   Chickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each, so:
   \[
   2C + 4W = 70
   \]

Now, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[
C + 2W = 35
\]

Now we have the system of equations:
1. \( C + W = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2W = 35 \)

Next, we can solve this system. We can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(C + 2W) - (C + W) = 35 - 20
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
W = 15
\]

Now that we know \( W \), we can substitute it back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[
C + 15 = 20
\]
\[
C = 20 - 15 = 5
\]

Thus, the number of chickens is \( \boxed{5} \).",0.0035983500000000006,10.939079761505127,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_confidence,

1. **Calculate the total number of pizzas**: 
   Henry and his 3 friends ordered 7 pizzas.

2. **Calculate the total number of slices**: 
   Each pizza is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is:
   \[
   \text{Total slices} = \text{Number of pizzas} \times \text{Slices per pizza} = 7 \times 8 = 56 \text{ slices}
