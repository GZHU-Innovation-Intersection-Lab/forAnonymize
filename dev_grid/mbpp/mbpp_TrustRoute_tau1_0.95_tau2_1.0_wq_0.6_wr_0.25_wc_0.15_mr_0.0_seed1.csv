def even_bit_set_number(n):

Wait, let me reconsider. The function needs to work for numbers of any size and the assertion shows `even_bit_set_number(10) == 10`, which means 10 (binary: 1010) should remain 10. In binary, 10 is `1010` where bits at positions 1 and 3 (0-indexed from right) are set - these are the even positions (0, 2, 4...) if we consider 0-indexed from the right.

Let me verify: 10 = 1010 in binary. If we're setting even bits (positions 0, 2, 4, 6... from right), bit 0 is already 0, bit 2 is already 1. Setting them would give 1010 | 0101... but that would change it.

Actually, looking at the assertion again: 10 stays 10, meaning bits at positions 1 and 3 are already set. So ""even bits"" likely means bits at even positions (0, 2, 4, 6...) counting from position 0 on the right.

10 = 1010₂ - positions 1 and 3 are set. If even positions (0, 2, 4...) should be set, we need a mask like ...0101010. But the result is 10, so this interpretation seems wrong.

Let me reconsider: maybe ""even bits"" means bit positions 2, 4, 6, 8... (counting from 1). Then 10 = 1010₂ has bit 2 and bit 4 set (from right, 1-indexed), which are even positions.
