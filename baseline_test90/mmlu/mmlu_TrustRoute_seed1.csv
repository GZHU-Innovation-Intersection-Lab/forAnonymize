The key development that undid this pattern was **C. The Industrial Revolution**.

The Industrial Revolution enabled European merchants (particularly the British) to produce manufactured goods that could compete in Asian markets, most notably textiles. This, combined with the forced opium trade, reversed the flow of silver - instead of silver flowing into China, it began flowing out. The Industrial Revolution fundamentally changed the trade balance between Europe and China that had characterized earlier centuries.

2. **The Mortgage's Status**: The friend's mortgage was recorded and covers the entire original property. When the investor subdivided and sold the western farm to the developer with no mention of the mortgage, the mortgage still encumbers the western farm (it wasn't released or satisfied).

3. **Timing of Rescission**: The key issue is WHEN the rancher can rescind:
   - The general rule is that a buyer cannot rescind before the closing date merely because title appears unmarketable
   - The seller has until the closing date to cure any title defects
   - Only if the seller fails to deliver marketable title at closing can the buyer rescind

4. **Application Here**: 
   - The rancher discovered the encumbrance on January 10
   - Closing is set for January 15
   - The florist still has until January 15 to cure the defect (e.g., pay off the mortgage)

**Forward stagewise selection**: This is different. It adds features incrementally but uses small steps and doesn't fully optimize at each stage.

Let me work through this step by step:

1. **Number of chickens in the US**: The US has approximately 9-10 billion chickens (mostly broilers and layers)

2. **Excrement per chicken per day**: A chicken produces roughly 0.1 kg of excrement per day

3. **Annual calculation**:
   - 10 billion chickens = 10^10 chickens
   - 0.1 kg/day × 365 days = 36.5 kg/year per chicken
   - Total = 10^10 × 36.5 kg ≈ 3.65 × 10^11 kg ≈ 4 × 10^11 kg

However, I should consider that broiler chickens have shorter lifespans (6-8 weeks), so there's turnover. The US produces about 9 billion broilers annually with multiple cycles per year.

Adjusting for this:
- With turnover, effective chicken-years might be around 10-15 billion
- 10-15 × 10^9 chickens × 30-40 kg/year ≈ 3-6 × 10^11 kg

This is closest to 10^12 kg order of magnitude.

1. The college student frequently lent his car to his friend
2. The college student gave permission only after determining the friend was a careful driver

**Option A (Habit):** Habit evidence under FRE 406 refers to a person's regular response to a repeated specific situation. The girlfriend's testimony about the college student's practice of checking that his friend was careful before lending the car could qualify as habit evidence showing his regular careful conduct in this specific situation.

**Option B (Present sense impression):** This is a hearsay exception for statements describing an event made while or immediately after perceiving it. The girlfriend's testimony isn't about contemporaneous statements, so this doesn't apply.

**Option C (Character):** While this touches on the college student's character for carefulness, it's not being offered as general character evidence. It's specific evidence about his conduct in this particular type of situation (lending his car), which is relevant to whether he was negligent in this entrustment.

**Option D (Bias):** While the girlfriend may be biased, bias goes to the weight of evidence, not admissibility. Bias can be explored on cross-examination but doesn't make testimony inadmissible.

The testimony is most properly characterized as habit evidence showing the college student's regular practice of careful assessment before lending his car.

Both C=O bonds stretch and compress in phase. The molecule remains symmetric with the center of positive and negative charge at the same point. No change in dipole moment.

mmlu,mmlu-1158,TrustRoute,1,"I need to determine whether the complex numbers can be made into an ordered field with a linear order relation.

For an ordered field, we need:
1. A linear (total) order ≤
2. If a ≤ b, then a + c ≤ b + c for all c
3. If 0 ≤ a and 0 ≤ b, then 0 ≤ ab

Let me check if C can be an ordered field:

Suppose (C, +, ×, ≤) is an ordered field. Then either 0 ≤ i or i ≤ 0.

Case 1: If 0 ≤ i, then by property 3, 0 ≤ i × i = i² = -1.
This means -1 ≥ 0, so 1 ≤ 0.

Case 2: If i ≤ 0, then 0 ≤ -i.
By property 3, 0 ≤ (-i) × (-i) = (-i)² = -1.
Again, this means -1 ≥ 0, so 1 ≤ 0.

But in any ordered field, we must have 1 = 1² ≥ 0 (since 1 ≠ 0, either 1 > 0 or 1 < 0; if 1 < 0, then 1² > 0, contradiction; so 1 > 0).

This contradiction shows that C cannot be made into an ordered field.

So statement B is FALSE.

For statement A: Can we place a linear order on C such that it's NOT an ordered field?

Yes, trivially. For example, we can use lexicographic ordering: (a + bi) ≤ (c + di) if a < c, or a = c and b ≤ d. This is a linear order on C, but it doesn't satisfy the ordered field axioms (as we showed C cannot be an ordered field). So (C, +, ×, ≤) with this order is not an ordered field.

Statement A is TRUE.

Let me analyze each option:

**Option A**: The covenant described the shopping center by metes and bounds and applied to ""the shopping center.""

The covenant can be reasonably interpreted to apply only to the original shopping center premises that existed at the time of the lease.

**Option B**: This is a general principle about covenants, but it's not absolute. The owner could potentially make promises about future acquisitions or broader commitments.

**Option C**: This is incorrect. Non-competition covenants in commercial leases are generally valid and enforceable, especially when they're reasonable in scope and protect the tenant's legitimate business interests.

Key concepts:
- Compliance = ΔV/ΔP (change in volume per unit change in pressure)
- High compliance = large volume change causes small pressure change
- Low compliance = small volume change causes large pressure change

During systole:
- Volume is removed from the venous side (high compliance)
- The same volume is added to the arterial side (low compliance)

For the venous compartment (high compliance):
- Losing volume causes a pressure decrease
- But because compliance is HIGH, the pressure change is SMALL

For the arterial compartment (low compliance):
- Gaining volume causes a pressure increase
- Because compliance is LOW, the pressure change is LARGE

Therefore: removing volume from a high-compliance venous system has little effect on venous pressure, while adding the same volume to a low-compliance arterial system causes a large increase in arterial pressure.

mmlu,mmlu-3867,TrustRoute,1,"To solve this, I need to understand what happens under contractionary monetary policy.

Contractionary monetary policy is used to reduce inflation and slow down the economy. The central bank:

1. **Discount rate**: INCREASES - The Fed raises the discount rate (the rate at which banks borrow from the Fed) to make borrowing more expensive

2. **Nominal interest rate**: INCREASES - Higher discount rates lead to higher interest rates throughout the economy, making loans more expensive

3. **Aggregate demand**: DECREASES - Higher interest rates discourage borrowing and spending by consumers and businesses, reducing overall demand in the economy

mmlu,mmlu-13812,TrustRoute,1,"Looking at this study design:

- Two groups of pathologists examine the same kidney biopsies
- Group 1 knows the patient's race
- Group 2 is blinded to the patient's race
- Group 1 reports 'hypertensive nephropathy' more frequently in black patients than Group 2 does

The key issue is that knowledge of the patient's race is influencing how Group 1 interprets the pathology findings. This is a systematic error in how they're measuring/classifying the disease based on information that shouldn't affect the pathological diagnosis.

This is **observer bias** (also called detection bias or ascertainment bias) - where the observer's knowledge influences their assessment or classification of outcomes.

Let me evaluate the options:
- **A. Confounding**: This would be a third variable affecting both exposure and outcome - not applicable here
- **B. Nonresponse bias**: Related to differential participation rates - not relevant
- **C. Recall bias**: Related to differential memory of past exposures - not applicable to pathologist interpretation
- **D. Referral bias**: Related to how patients are selected for study - not the issue here

While ""observer bias"" would be the most precise answer, among the given options, none perfectly captures this. However, the question is testing recognition of bias introduced by lack of blinding in assessment.

Given standard medical education terminology and that this is clearly about biased assessment/detection, the answer is most consistent with detection/observer bias patterns, but since that's not listed, I need to reconsider if any option fits.

Actually, none of these options perfectly fit, but **A** is the closest if we're forced to choose, as the pathologists' knowledge acts as a confounding factor in their diagnostic process.

Let me set up the problem:
- Rowena's rate: 1/14 of the room per hour
- Ruby's rate: 1/6 of the room per hour

**Condition 1:** Rowena paints for x hours and Ruby paints for y hours → they finish half the room
$$\frac{x}{14} + \frac{y}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$$

**Condition 2:** Rowena paints for y hours and Ruby paints for x hours → they finish the whole room
$$\frac{y}{14} + \frac{x}{6} = 1$$

Now I'll solve this system of equations.

From equation 1:
$$\frac{x}{14} + \frac{y}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$$

Multiply by 42:
$$3x + 7y = 21$$ ... (equation A)

From equation 2:
$$\frac{y}{14} + \frac{x}{6} = 1$$

Multiply by 42:
$$3y + 7x = 42$$ ... (equation B)

Now I have:
- Equation A: $3x + 7y = 21$
- Equation B: $7x + 3y = 42$

Multiply equation A by 7: $21x + 49y = 147$
Multiply equation B by 3: $21x + 9y = 126$

Subtract: $40y = 21$
$$y = \frac{21}{40}$$

Substitute into equation A:
$$3x + 7 \cdot \frac{21}{40} = 21$$
$$3x + \frac{147}{40} = 21$$
$$3x = 21 - \frac{147}{40} = \frac{840 - 147}{40} = \frac{693}{40}$$
$$x = \frac{693}{120} = \frac{231}{40}$$

Let me verify:

For x = 0: 0³ + 2(0)² + 2(0) + 1 = 1 ≠ 0 (mod 7)

For x = 1: 1³ + 2(1)² + 2(1) + 1 = 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 6 ≠ 0 (mod 7)

For x = 2: 2³ + 2(2)² + 2(2) + 1 = 8 + 8 + 4 + 1 = 21 ≡ 0 (mod 7) ✓

For x = 3: 3³ + 2(3)² + 2(3) + 1 = 27 + 18 + 6 + 1 = 52 ≡ 3 (mod 7)

For x = 4: 4³ + 2(4)² + 2(4) + 1 = 64 + 32 + 8 + 1 = 105 ≡ 0 (mod 7) ✓

For x = 5: 5³ + 2(5)² + 2(5) + 1 = 125 + 50 + 10 + 1 = 186 ≡ 4 (mod 7)

So the roots are x = 2, 4, 6.

The factorization is (x - 2)(x - 4)(x - 6).

In Z₇, note that 6 ≡ -1 (mod 7), so x - 6 ≡ x + 1.

3. **The Letter**: Sent after turning 18, offering $10,000 contingent on finding a job
4. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the letter constitutes ratification of the voidable contract

**Analysis:**

- Contracts entered into by minors are voidable at the minor's option
- Upon reaching majority (18), the youth can either ratify or disaffirm the contract
- The letter was sent AFTER turning 18, so any ratification would be valid
- However, the letter does NOT constitute a clear ratification because:
  - It disputes the value of the car (""real lemon"")
  - It questions whether the car is worth $36,000
  - It makes only a conditional offer ($10,000 if he finds a job)
  - This is more of a negotiation/settlement offer than an affirmation of the original contract

- The youth never made an unequivocal ratification of the original contract after turning 18

- When a minor disaffirms, they must return what they received (or its value if impossible to return)
- The car was destroyed and worth $18,000 at the time of the accident

**Proper Recovery**: The dealership can recover the value of what the youth received minus what was already paid: $18,000 - $12,000 = $6,000... but this isn't an option.

Distillation separates components based on differences in boiling points. The most volatile (lowest boiling point) component will vaporize first and can be separated.

Let me analyze each compound:

- KCl(aq): Potassium chloride is an ionic salt with a very high melting/boiling point (>1400°C). It would remain in solution.

- Fe(NO3)3(aq): Iron(III) nitrate is an ionic salt that decomposes before boiling. It would remain in solution.

- MgSO4(aq): Magnesium sulfate is an ionic salt with a very high decomposition temperature. It would remain in solution.

- N2H4(aq): Hydrazine is a molecular compound (not ionic) with a relatively low boiling point of about 114°C. It is volatile and can be distilled.

The three ionic salts (KCl, Fe(NO3)3, and MgSO4) are non-volatile and would remain in the aqueous solution. N2H4 (hydrazine) is the only volatile compound that could be separated by distillation.

ii) **Particularly for small samples, there is a high chance of the tests suggesting that variables are not cointegrated when they are** - TRUE. The Engle-Granger test has low power in small samples, leading to Type II errors (failing to reject the null of no cointegration when cointegration exists).

iii) **It is not possible to make inferences on the cointegrating regression** - TRUE. The OLS estimates in the first step have non-standard distributions, making standard inference procedures invalid. You cannot use standard t-statistics or confidence intervals.

iv) **The procedure forces the researcher to specify which is the dependent variable and which are the independent variables** - TRUE. The Engle-Granger approach requires choosing one variable as the dependent variable in the cointegrating regression, which is arbitrary and can affect results.

1. **Start in Grantee Index under caterer's name** - to see if the caterer ever received the property (find when caterer was a grantee)

2. **Then check Grantor Index under caterer's name** - to verify the caterer had good title and to see what conveyances the caterer made

3. **Then go back to Grantee Index under artist's name** - to trace back further and see if the artist (who conveyed to caterer) actually acquired title

This backward chain continues until you reach a sovereign source of title.

- Then check what the caterer did with it

**Scenario 1:** ""I don't want to see my baby being teased, so I'll have him adopted.""

Giving a baby up for adoption to avoid witnessing teasing is morally questionable. While adoption itself can be a responsible choice in difficult circumstances, doing it primarily to avoid the discomfort of witnessing teasing (rather than for the child's welfare) suggests abandoning parental responsibility for a relatively minor reason. This would generally be considered morally wrong.

**Scenario 2:** ""I wanted to watch the predator of little kids.""

The phrase ""predator of little kids"" refers to someone who preys on children. Wanting to watch such a person (which could imply watching them commit crimes against children, or consuming content of child exploitation) is clearly morally wrong and likely illegal.

**C.** A positive charge moves in the direction of an electric field (TRUE - force and thus acceleration is in direction of E for positive charge); a positive charge moves perpendicular to a magnetic field (TRUE - magnetic force is perpendicular to both v and B).

**D.** All moving charges experience a force parallel to an electric field (TRUE - F = qE is parallel to E) and perpendicular to a magnetic field (FALSE - only if the charge is moving perpendicular to B; if moving parallel to B, force is zero).

For attempted rape, there must be:
1. Specific intent to commit rape
2. A substantial step toward committing the crime

From the facts:
- The cab driver made sexual advances
- The passenger responded positively by kissing him and holding his hand
- This appears to be consensual interaction
- There's no indication of force, threat, or lack of consent
- The passenger invited him in voluntarily
- She reciprocated his advances

The fact that she's an undercover officer is irrelevant to whether a crime occurred - what matters is whether the cab driver's actions constituted attempted rape.

Making consensual sexual advances that are reciprocated does not constitute attempted rape. There's no evidence of:
- Intent to use force
- Intent to have non-consensual sex
- Any substantial step toward rape

Regarding the options:
- B is wrong because entrapment requires inducement by police to commit a crime the person wasn't predisposed to commit - there's no such inducement here
- C is wrong because alibi isn't relevant (he was there)

**Statement 1: ""Besides EM, gradient descent can be used to perform inference or learning on Gaussian mixture model.""**

This is TRUE. While EM (Expectation-Maximization) is the most common algorithm for learning GMMs, gradient descent can also be used. The log-likelihood of a GMM is differentiable with respect to the parameters (means, covariances, mixing coefficients), so gradient-based optimization methods can be applied. In fact, modern deep learning frameworks often use gradient descent variants for GMM learning.

**Statement 2: ""Assuming a fixed number of attributes, a Gaussian-based Bayes optimal classifier can be learned in time linear in the number of records in the dataset.""**

This is TRUE. For a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier (or even a Gaussian discriminant analysis classifier), with a fixed number of attributes d:
- We need to compute class priors: O(n) where n is the number of records
- We need to compute means for each class: O(n×d) = O(n) since d is fixed
- We need to compute covariances: O(n×d²) = O(n) since d is fixed

All these operations are linear in n when d is fixed, so the learning time is O(n).

mmlu,mmlu-906,TrustRoute,1,"I need to find the chemical shift of trifluoroacetic acid given the frequency difference and benzene's chemical shift.

Given information:
- Spectrometer frequency: 400 MHz
- Benzene ¹H chemical shift: 7.16 ppm
- Benzene Larmor frequency exceeds TFA by 1.656 kHz

The relationship between chemical shift (δ) and frequency is:
Frequency difference (Hz) = δ (ppm) × Spectrometer frequency (MHz)

For benzene at 7.16 ppm on a 400 MHz spectrometer:
Frequency offset from reference = 7.16 × 400 = 2864 Hz

Since benzene's frequency exceeds TFA's frequency by 1.656 kHz = 1656 Hz:
TFA frequency offset = 2864 - 1656 = 1208 Hz

Converting back to ppm:
δ(TFA) = 1208 Hz / 400 MHz = 1208 / 400 = 3.02 ppm

When a person hyperventilates (breathes too fast):
1. They exhale more CO₂ than normal
2. This causes a decrease in partial pressure of CO₂ (PCO₂) in the blood

Now for the effect on hydrogen ions (H⁺):
- CO₂ in blood forms carbonic acid: CO₂ + H₂O ⇌ H₂CO₃ ⇌ H⁺ + HCO₃⁻
- When CO₂ decreases, this equilibrium shifts left
- This means less H⁺ is produced
- Therefore, H⁺ concentration decreases
- This causes the blood pH to increase (respiratory alkalosis)

So hyperventilation causes:
- Decrease in PCO₂
- Decrease in H⁺ concentration

Key facts:
- Contractor initially quoted $100,000
- Homeowner offered $80,000
- Contractor said he'd ""think about it"" and left (no acceptance yet)
- Neighbor then promised contractor $10,000 if he would accept the homeowner's $80,000 offer
- Contractor agreed to neighbor's promise
- Contractor then accepted homeowner's offer and completed the work

The critical issue is consideration. For the neighbor's promise to be enforceable, the contractor must have provided valid consideration.

When the neighbor made his promise, the contractor had NOT yet accepted the homeowner's offer. The contractor was under no obligation to accept it. By agreeing to accept the homeowner's offer (which he was free to reject), the contractor provided something of value - he gave up his legal right to decline the offer.

This is NOT a pre-existing duty situation because:
- The contractor had no duty to accept the $80,000 offer when the neighbor made his promise
- The contractor's acceptance of the homeowner's offer was the bargained-for consideration for the neighbor's promise

Option D is incorrect because there was no pre-existing obligation at the moment of the neighbor's promise.

Option C is incorrect because the neighbor's promise was not illusory - it was a definite promise to pay $10,000.

Option B is incorrect because consideration doesn't depend on whether the neighbor actually benefits.

Option A is correct because the contractor's act of accepting the homeowner's offer (and completing the work) constituted valid consideration for the neighbor's promise.

mmlu,mmlu-10950,TrustRoute,1,"Looking at this problem, I need to analyze whether the graduate can succeed in a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) against the bar-review company.

The elements for IIED typically require:
1. Extreme and outrageous conduct
2. Intent to cause severe emotional distress (or reckless disregard)
3. Causation
4. Severe emotional distress

Let me evaluate the company's conduct:
- Initially filing the complaint may have been reasonable given what they observed
- However, after receiving and depositing the graduate's check (proving she intended to pay all along), they failed to inform the prosecutor
- This failure to correct the situation after learning the truth is the key issue

The question asks me to choose between the options:

Option C focuses on intent - but IIED can be established through reckless disregard, not just intent. The company's failure to inform the prosecutor after receiving payment could constitute reckless disregard.

Option D focuses on whether the conduct was ""outrageous"" - this is the critical element. While the company's failure to inform the prosecutor after receiving payment was wrongful, courts generally hold that merely initiating legal proceedings (even if mistaken) does not rise to the level of ""extreme and outrageous"" conduct required for IIED. The conduct must be so extreme as to go beyond all bounds of decency. Filing a criminal complaint, even with the subsequent failure to correct it, typically doesn't meet this very high threshold.

Between C and D, option D better captures why the claim would fail - the conduct, while problematic, doesn't meet the ""outrageous"" standard required for IIED.

**Alternative scenario:** Allocating variances to WIP, Finished Goods, and COGS.

When unfavorable variances are allocated instead of being written off entirely to COGS:
- Some variance amounts go to WIP (current asset) and Finished Goods (current asset)
- Less variance goes to COGS compared to writing off directly

**Effect on Current Ratio:**
- Current assets increase (WIP and FG are higher)
- Current liabilities unchanged
- Current ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities → **Increases**

**Effect on Net Income:**
- Less unfavorable variance charged to COGS means lower COGS

Key concepts:
- For a cycle, the gas returns to its initial state, so ΔU = 0
- First Law of Thermodynamics: ΔU = Q - W
- For a cycle: 0 = Q - W, therefore Q = W

Work convention:
- On a P-V diagram, the area enclosed by the cycle represents work
- Clockwise cycle: work is done BY the system (W > 0)
- Counterclockwise cycle: work is done ON the system (W < 0)

For a counterclockwise cycle:
- The system does negative work (work is done on the system)
- W = -300 J (taking the convention that work done by the system is positive)

Using the First Law for a complete cycle:
- ΔU = 0 (returns to initial state)
- Q = W = -300 J

Since Q is negative, heat flows OUT of the system.

The magnitude is 300 J, and it flows out of the system.

mmlu,mmlu-1141,TrustRoute,1,"I need to evaluate each statement carefully.

**Statement 1:** f : X → Y is continuous and X is compact. f must be uniformly continuous.

This statement is **FALSE** in general. A continuous function from a compact space to any topological space need not be uniformly continuous. Uniform continuity requires a *metric* structure, not just a topological structure. 

However, there's an important theorem: If f : X → Y is continuous, X is compact metric space, and Y is a metric space, then f IS uniformly continuous.

But the statement doesn't specify that X and Y are metric spaces - it just says topological spaces. Without the metric structure, uniform continuity isn't even defined. So the statement as written is **FALSE**.

**Statement 2:** If f(x), g(x) : R → R are everywhere differentiable, then f(g(x)) must be everywhere differentiable.

By the chain rule, if g is differentiable at x and f is differentiable at g(x), then f ∘ g is differentiable at x with:
(f ∘ g)'(x) = f'(g(x)) · g'(x)

Since both f and g are everywhere differentiable on R, for any x ∈ R:
- g is differentiable at x
- g(x) ∈ R, and f is differentiable at g(x)

Therefore f(g(x)) is everywhere differentiable. This statement is **TRUE**.

First, let me find the identity element e.
For e to be the identity: a*e = a
a+e+1 = a
e+1 = 0
e = -1

So the identity element is -1.

Now, for the inverse of a (let's call it a⁻¹), we need:
a*a⁻¹ = e = -1

Using the operation:
a*a⁻¹ = a+a⁻¹+1 = -1
a+a⁻¹+1 = -1
a⁻¹ = -1-1-a
a⁻¹ = -2-a
a⁻¹ = -(2+a)

Let me verify with option D: -(2+a) = (-1)(2+a) = (2+a)·(-1)

This matches option D.

**Chain of Title Analysis:**

2. **1994**: Farmer → Son (paid $1,000, unrecorded)
3. **1998**: Farmer → Investor (paid $10,000, recorded) - VOID, farmer had no title
4. **1999**: Son → Rancher (paid $15,000, unrecorded)
5. **2003**: Investor → Teacher (paid $20,000, recorded) - gets nothing from investor
6. **2007**: Rancher → Professor (paid $25,000, recorded)

**Key Issue**: Can the Professor qualify as a BFP under the recording act?

The recording act states: ""Every conveyance of real estate which is not recorded is void against a subsequent purchaser in good faith for valuable consideration, whose conveyance shall be first duly recorded.""

**Professor's Status:**
- Paid valuable consideration ($25,000) ✓
- Recorded first (Son's and Rancher's deeds were never recorded) ✓
- Good faith? This is the critical question

The Professor:
- Did NOT search title (so wouldn't find the recorded Investor→Teacher deed)
- Visited the property and saw a fence but no one was present
- The fence alone, without more, may not constitute sufficient notice of adverse possession or ownership

**With Grantor-Grantee Indices**: The Professor, searching from ""Farmer"" as grantor, would find Farmer→Investor (1998). He would NOT find Son→Rancher because Son is not in his chain of title (the Farmer→Son deed was unrecorded, making Son a ""wild deed"").

Since the Professor didn't search at all, he had no actual knowledge of the Son→Rancher deed. The fence provided ambiguous constructive notice at best.

Under a notice-type recording statute, the Professor can be a BFP who takes priority over the prior unrecorded deeds.

First, I'll find the probability that any single cyclone becomes a hurricane:
p = 5.1/8.7 ≈ 0.5862

This is a binomial probability problem with:
- n = 5 (number of cyclones)
- p ≈ 0.5862 (probability each becomes a hurricane)
- We want P(X ≥ 3) where X is the number that become hurricanes

P(X ≥ 3) = P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) + P(X = 5)

Using the binomial formula: P(X = k) = C(n,k) × p^k × (1-p)^(n-k)

P(X = 3) = C(5,3) × (0.5862)³ × (0.4138)²
         = 10 × 0.2013 × 0.1712

P(X = 4) = C(5,4) × (0.5862)⁴ × (0.4138)¹
         = 5 × 0.1180 × 0.4138
         ≈ 0.2442

P(X = 5) = C(5,5) × (0.5862)⁵ × (0.4138)⁰

Given:

- At t₂ = 0.20 s: velocity = 15 cm/s east

Key observations:
1. The velocity decreased from 25 cm/s to 15 cm/s (the cart is slowing down)
2. The change in velocity: Δv = 15 - 25 = -10 cm/s (negative in the eastward direction)
3. This means Δv points west

From Newton's second law:
- F_net = ma = m(Δv/Δt)
- Since Δv points west, the acceleration points west
- Therefore, the net force points west (opposite to the direction of motion)

The confidence interval (18, 41) represents the estimated difference between Lipitor and niacin's effects on mean cholesterol levels for populations, not individuals.

Let me evaluate each option:

**Option A**: This misinterprets the CI as individual values rather than a range for the difference. The CI tells us about the difference between the two treatments, not their absolute effects.

**Option B**: This incorrectly interprets the confidence interval as a probability for individual outcomes. A CI is about population parameters, not predictions for individuals. Also, confidence intervals don't give probabilities about future events.

**Option C**: Similar to B, this misapplies the CI to individual predictions and treats it as a probability statement about individual outcomes, which is incorrect.

**Option D**: None of the above interpretations are correct.

The correct interpretation would be: ""We are 95% confident that the true difference in mean cholesterol reduction between Lipitor and niacin (for the populations) is between 18 and 41 points, with Lipitor being more effective.""

- H₀: μ = 1.25 (machinery is working properly)
- Hₐ: μ ≠ 1.25 (machinery is not working properly)

**Type II error means:**
- Failing to reject H₀ when H₀ is false
- This means: NOT stopping production when μ ≠ 1.25
- In other words: The mean diameter is actually NOT 1.25 (machinery is faulty), but we fail to detect it and continue production

- Husband and Wife: 1/2 (as tenants by the entirety)
- Woman: 1/2

**June 1, 2006:** Woman conveys her remaining 1/2 interest to Husband and Brother as joint tenants.
- Husband and Wife: 1/2 (as tenants by the entirety)
- Husband and Brother: 1/2 (as joint tenants, so each has equal share)

**Husband conveys to Cousin:** Husband transfers all his interests.

From the tenancy by entirety: Husband cannot unilaterally convey his interest in a tenancy by the entirety. This conveyance is ineffective.

From the joint tenancy with Brother: Husband can convey his share (1/2 of the 1/2 = 1/4). This severs the joint tenancy between Husband and Brother, converting it to a tenancy in common.

After Husband's conveyance:
- Wife: 1/2 (still holds the tenancy by entirety interest, but Husband's death will affect this)
- Cousin: 1/4 (from Husband's joint tenancy share)
- Brother: 1/4 (remaining from the severed joint tenancy)

**Husband dies:** The tenancy by the entirety terminates. Wife takes the entire 1/2 interest by right of survivorship.
- Wife: 1/2
- Cousin: 1/4
- Brother: 1/4

**Brother dies:** Brother held as tenant in common (after severance), so his 1/4 passes to his heirs/estate, not to other co-tenants.

mmlu,mmlu-2040,TrustRoute,1,"To solve this problem, I need to recall the relationship between latching current and holding current in a thyristor.

Key concepts:
- **Holding current (IH)**: The minimum anode current required to maintain the thyristor in the ON state after it has been triggered and the gate signal is removed.
- **Latching current (IL)**: The minimum anode current required to maintain the thyristor in the ON state immediately after the gate signal is removed during the turn-on process.

Important relationship:
**Latching current (IL) > Holding current (IH)**

Typically, the latching current is 2 to 3 times the holding current.

Given: Holding current = 2 mA = 0.002 A

Looking at the options:

- B. 0.002 A = 2 mA (equal to IH - not possible)
- C. 0.009 A = 9 mA (4.5 times IH)
- D. 0.004 A = 4 mA (2 times IH)

Since IL must be greater than IH and typically 2-3 times larger, option D (0.004 A = 4 mA) represents 2 times the holding current, which is the most reasonable answer.

mmlu,mmlu-7335,TrustRoute,1,"To solve this problem, I need to determine how frequently a 4-base recognition sequence appears in a random DNA sequence.

For a specific 4-base sequence:
- Probability of any specific base at a position = 1/4
- Probability of a specific 4-base sequence = (1/4)^4 = 1/256

This means the recognition site appears approximately once every 256 base pairs.

For a genome of 5,000 bp:
- Expected number of recognition sites = 5,000 / 256 ≈ 19.5 ≈ 20 sites

If there are 20 recognition sites, the DNA will be cut at 20 positions, creating approximately 21 fragments (20 cuts + 1 = 21 fragments, but the question asks about cuts/cleavage events, which would be ~20).

Let me set up the functional equation.

When we shift f(x) right by 2 units: f(x-2)
When we stretch vertically by factor 2: 2f(x-2)

The condition states: 2f(x-2) = f(x)

This means: f(x) = 2f(x-2)

Or equivalently: f(x+2) = 2f(x)

This is a functional equation. Let me find the pattern by applying it repeatedly:
- f(2) = 2f(0)
- f(4) = 2f(2) = 2·2f(0) = 4f(0)
- f(6) = 2f(4) = 2·4f(0) = 8f(0)
- f(8) = 2f(6) = 2·8f(0) = 16f(0)
- f(10) = 2f(8) = 2·16f(0) = 32f(0)

In general, for x = 2n where n is a non-negative integer:
f(2n) = 2^n · f(0)

Given f(0) = 0.1:
f(10) = f(2·5) = 2^5 · f(0) = 32 · 0.1 = 3.2

**Starting point:** Recessionary gap (economy below full employment) + budget deficit exists

- To fix a recession, the government needs expansionary fiscal policy
- Options: Tax cut or increased government spending
- Looking at choices: B and C have tax cuts (expansionary), A and D have tax increases (contractionary)
- So the answer must be B or C

**Step 2: Impact on Loanable Funds Market**
- A tax cut with existing budget deficit → larger budget deficit
- Larger deficit means government borrows more
- Government borrowing increases DEMAND for loanable funds (government is demanding funds)
- This eliminates B (which says supply rises)

**Step 3: Interest Rate**
- Increased demand for loanable funds → interest rates rise
- C says ""rising"" ✓

**Step 4: Market for U.S. Dollar**

- To buy U.S. assets, they need dollars

b^{-1}a^{-1}b^{-1}a^{-1} = b^{-1}b^{-1}a^{-1}a^{-1}

The contract states: ""I will lend him $50,000... **provided he signs a contract with a builder** for construction of the shopping center.""

The key phrase is ""provided he signs a contract with a builder"" - this is the condition that must occur before the seller's duty to lend arises.

Now, what about the developer's duty to enter into a building construction contract?

The contract does NOT impose any duty on the developer to sign a construction contract. The developer is free to sign or not sign such a contract. If he signs, he gets the loan. If he doesn't sign, he doesn't get the loan. But there's no obligation either way.

Since the developer has no duty to enter into a building construction contract, there cannot be a condition (precedent or subsequent) to that non-existent duty.

The signing of the construction contract is a condition precedent to the **seller's** duty to lend, not a condition to any duty of the developer.

**Step 1: Calculate moles of each**
- Moles of HBr = 0.0025 M × 0.050 L = 0.000125 mol
- Moles of KOH = 0.0023 M × 0.050 L = 0.000115 mol

**Step 2: Determine the neutralization**
HBr + KOH → KBr + H₂O

Since HBr is in excess:
- Excess HBr = 0.000125 - 0.000115 = 0.000010 mol

**Step 3: Calculate concentration of excess H⁺**
Total volume = 50.0 mL + 50.0 mL = 100.0 mL = 0.100 L

[H⁺] = 0.000010 mol / 0.100 L = 0.0001 M = 1 × 10⁻⁴ M

**Step 4: Calculate pH**
pH = -log[H⁺] = -log(1 × 10⁻⁴) = 4

Let me denote the original number of pins as x.

- John divided his pins into two equal piles: x/2 pins in each pile
- He gave his brother 1/2 of 1/3 of one pile: (1/2) × (1/3) × (x/2) = x/12 pins given away
- John had 66 pins left

So: Original pins - Pins given away = Pins left
x - x/12 = 66

Solving:
(12x - x)/12 = 66
11x/12 = 66
11x = 792
x = 72

Let me verify: 
- Original: 72 pins
- Two piles: 36 pins each
- Gave away: 1/2 × 1/3 × 36 = 1/2 × 12 = 6 pins

When producers expect higher prices in the near future, they will:
- Hold back current supply to sell more later at the expected higher price
- This causes current supply to decrease (supply curve shifts left)

Effects of a leftward supply shift:
- With demand unchanged and supply decreased, there is a shortage at the original price
- This pushes the equilibrium price UP
- The equilibrium quantity FALLS (less is being sold at the higher price)
