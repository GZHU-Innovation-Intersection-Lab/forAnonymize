gsm8k,gsm8k-201,SA,1,"To determine how much money John made that year after receiving the award, we need to break down the components of his earnings into two parts: the monetary reward and his salary over the year. 

1. **Calculate the monetary reward:** 
   - John receives a one-time award of $5000.

2. **Calculate his weekly salary before the raise:**
   - John's weekly salary is $2000. 
   - Since he works all 52 weeks in a year, we will calculate his total salary for the year before the raise.

   Total salary before raise = Weekly salary × Number of weeks
   \[
   = 2000 \times 52 = 104000
   \]

3. **Calculate the raise in salary:**
   - John receives a 5% raise on his salary. 
   - First, we need to calculate what 5% of his weekly salary is.
   \[
   5\% \text{ of } 2000 = 0.05 \times 2000 = 100
   \]
   - After the raise, his new weekly salary becomes:
   \[
   2000 + 100 = 2100
   \]

4. **Calculate his total salary with the raise for the year:**
   - With the new salary, we will calculate his total salary for the year.
   \[
   = 2100 \times 52 = 109200
   \]

5. **Combine the total earnings from salary and the monetary reward:**
   - Now we will add the one-time monetary reward to his total salary for the year.
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = \text{Total salary with raise} + \text{Monetary reward}
   \]
   \[
   = 109200 + 5000 = 114200

gsm8k,gsm8k-205,SA,1,"To determine what score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after dropping her lowest score, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the current test scores**: Brinley has scores of 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86 from her first five tests.

2. **Calculate the total score needed for an average of 93**: Since Mr. Bert allows dropping the lowest score from the six tests, we need to find the total score that Brinley must achieve over the five highest scores to get an average of 93.

   - The average formula is: 
     \[
     \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of scores}}{\text{Number of scores}}
     \]
   - To find the sum needed for an average of 93 with 5 scores, we can rearrange the formula:
     \[
     \text{Sum of scores} = \text{Average} \times \text{Number of scores} = 93 \times 5 = 465
     \]

3. **Determine the lowest score to drop**: Before we can find out what score Brinley needs on her sixth test, we need to know which of her current scores will be dropped. The lowest score among her current scores is 71. Thus, we will use the sum of the other scores to find the required sixth score.

4. **Calculate the total of the first five tests without the lowest score**:
   - The scores excluding the lowest score (71) are: 89, 92, 100, and 86.
   - The sum of these scores:
     \[
     89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367
     \]

5. **Set up the equation for the sixth score**: Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test. We want the sum of the four scores (367) plus the sixth score (x) to equal 465:
   \[
   367 + x = 465
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - Subtract 367 from both sides:
     \[
     x = 465 - 367 = 98

1. **Determine the weight of the chocolate bars:**
   - Joe has 25 chocolate bars.
   - Each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams.
   - Total weight of chocolate bars = Number of chocolate bars × Weight of each chocolate bar
   - Total weight of chocolate bars = 25 × 40g = 1000g

2. **Determine the weight of the candied apples:**
   - Joe has 80 candied apples.
   - Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, we can find the weight of each candied apple.
   - Let the weight of each candied apple be \( x \).
   - Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g, we have:

1. **Understand the quantities involved:**
   - We have twenty dozen cups. Since one dozen is 12, twenty dozen equals:
     \[
     20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ cups}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Half a dozen is 6 plates. Each plate costs $6000, so the total cost of half a dozen plates is:
     \[
     6 \times 6000 = 36000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Determine the total cost of the cups:**
   - According to the problem, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. Therefore, the total cost of the cups can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of cups} = \text{Total cost of plates} - 1200
     \]
     Substituting the value we found for the total cost of plates:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of cups} = 36000 - 1200 = 34800 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the cost per cup:**
   - To find the cost per cup, we divide the total cost of the cups by the number of cups:
     \[
     \text{Cost per cup} = \frac{\text{Total cost of cups}}{\text{Number of cups}} = \frac{34800}{240}

1. **Calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes:**
   - The jacket costs $30.
   - Each pair of shoes costs $20, and Sara wants to buy 2 pairs.
   - Total cost for the shoes = 2 pairs * $20/pair = $40.
   - Therefore, the total cost of the jacket and shoes = Cost of jacket + Cost of shoes = $30 + $40 = $70.

2. **Calculate Sara's earnings from babysitting:**
   - Sara babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time.
   - Total earnings from babysitting = 4 times * $5/time = $20.

3. **Calculate Sara's total savings before mowing the lawn:**
   - Sara already has $10 saved.
   - Total savings after babysitting = Savings before babysitting + Earnings from babysitting = $10 + $20 = $30.

4. **Determine how much more money Sara needs:**
   - Total needed for jacket and shoes = $70.
   - Total she currently has = $30.
   - Additional money needed = Total needed - Total she has = $70 - $30 = $40.

5. **Calculate how much Sara earns from mowing the lawn:**
   - Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn.

6. **Determine how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the additional $40:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of times she needs to mow the lawn.
   - Total earnings from mowing = $4 * \( x \).
   - We need this to equal $40: 
     \[
     4x = 40

1. **Define the variables:**
   Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \).

2. **Set up the relationships from the problem:**
   - We know that the white chickens are two more than the red chickens, so we can express this as:
     \[
     w = r + 2
     \]

3. **Set up the egg production equation:**
   - The red chickens produce 3 eggs each, so the total production from red chickens is \( 3r \).
   - The white chickens produce 5 eggs each, so the total production from white chickens is \( 5w \).
   - According to the problem, Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs every day:
     \[
     3r + 5w = 42
     \]

4. **Substitute the expression for \( w \):**
   - We can substitute \( w \) in the egg production equation:
     \[
     3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
     \]

5. **Distribute and simplify:**
   - Now, distribute the 5:
     \[
     3r + 5r + 10 = 42
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     8r + 10 = 42
     \]

6. **Isolate \( r \):**
   - Subtract 10 from both sides:
     \[
     8r = 32

From the problem statement, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
   \[
   B = 2S
   \]

2. Both pools leak water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. Therefore, in 4 minutes, they will lose:
   \[
   \text{Water lost} = 4 \text{ gallons/minute} \times 4 \text{ minutes} = 16 \text{ gallons}
   \]

Now, we can find the current amounts of water in both pools. The current amount of water in the small pool is:
\[
S_{\text{now}} = S - 16
\]
And the current amount of water in the big pool is:
\[
B_{\text{now}} = B - 16
\]

According to the problem, at the current moment, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[
B_{\text{now}} = 4 S_{\text{now}}
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( S_{\text{now}} \) and \( B_{\text{now}} \):
\[
B - 16 = 4(S - 16)
\]

Now substituting \( B = 2S \) into the equation:
\[
2S - 16 = 4(S - 16)
\]

Expanding the right side:
\[
2S - 16 = 4S - 64
\]

Now, let's rearrange the equation to solve for \( S \):
\[
2S - 4S = -64 + 16
\]
\[
-2S = -48
\]
\[
S = 24
\]

Now we can find the current amount of water in the small pool:
\[
S_{\text{now}} = S - 16 = 24 - 16 = 8
\]

Thus, the small pool currently has 8 gallons of water.

1. **Determine the total amount Janeth needs to repay.** 
   - Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10%.
   - To find the additional amount: 
     \[
     10\% \text{ of } 2000 = 0.10 \times 2000 = 200
     \]
   - Therefore, the total amount to be repaid is:
     \[
     \text{Total repayment} = 2000 + 200 = 2200
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months.** 
   - She is paying $165 a month for 12 months, so we need to calculate:
     \[
     \text{Total payments} = 165 \times 12
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     165 \times 12 = 1980
     \]

3. **Determine the remaining balance after 12 months.**
   - We subtract the total payments she made from the total amount to be repaid:
     \[
     \text{Remaining balance} = \text{Total repayment} - \text{Total payments}
     \]
   - Plugging in the values we calculated:

1. **Identify Harriet's current age**: 
   - Harriet is 21 years old.

2. **Calculate Adrian's age**: 
   - According to the problem, Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age. 
   - So, Adrian's age = 3 × Harriet's age = 3 × 21 = 63 years.

3. **Calculate Zack's age**: 
   - The problem states that Harriet is half the age of Zack.
   - Hence, if Harriet is 21 years old, then Zack's age = 2 × Harriet's age = 2 × 21 = 42 years.

4. **Current ages summary**:
   - Adrian: 63 years
   - Harriet: 21 years
   - Zack: 42 years

5. **Calculate the ages in three years**:
   - In three years, Adrian's age will be 63 + 3 = 66 years.

1. **Identify the scores of each student**:
   - Let Naomi's score be \( N = 68 \) points.
   - Yuri's score is 10 more than half of Naomi's score. We can calculate this:
     \[
     \text{Yuri's score} = \frac{N}{2} + 10 = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44 \text{ points}
     \]
   - Brianna's score is 17 points more than Naomi's score:
     \[
     \text{Brianna's score} = N + 17 = 68 + 17 = 85 \text{ points}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total points scored by the four students**:
   - We know the total score of all four students is 251 points. We have calculated the scores for Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
     - Naomi: 68 points
     - Yuri: 44 points
     - Brianna: 85 points
   - To find Jojo's score, we first calculate the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
     \[
     \text{Total points by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna} = N + \text{Yuri's score} + \text{Brianna's score} = 68 + 44 + 85
     \]
   - Now performing the arithmetic:
     \[
     68 + 44 = 112
     \]
     \[
     112 + 85 = 197
     \]

3. **Find Jojo's score**:
   - Since the total score of all four students is 251 points, we can find Jojo's score by subtracting the total points scored by the other three:
     \[
     \text{Jojo's score} = \text{Total score} - \text{Total points by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna} = 251 - 197
     \]
   - Performing this subtraction:
     \[
     251 - 197 = 54

   - We need to find out how many vines Steve needs to produce enough tomatoes for his daily consumption.

2. **Calculating Steve's weekly tomato consumption**:
   - Since Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, we first calculate how many tomatoes he eats in a week (7 days).
   - Weekly consumption = 6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week.

3. **Calculating the number of vines needed**:
   - Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week.
   - To find out how many vines are required to meet Steve's weekly consumption of 42 tomatoes, we divide the total number of tomatoes he needs by the number of tomatoes produced by one vine.
   - Number of vines needed = Total weekly tomatoes / Tomatoes per vine = 42 tomatoes / 3 tomatoes/vine = 14 vines.

Therefore, Steve needs 14 vines to meet his tomato consumption.

1. **Initial Purchase**: Ram buys 25 pens. Therefore, he starts with 25 full pens.

2. **Using the Pens**: As Ram uses these pens, they will eventually become empty. For every 5 empty pens, he can mix the ink to make 1 new full pen.

3. **Calculating the Empty Pens**: Once all 25 pens are used, Ram will have 25 empty pens.

4. **Making New Pens**: Now, he can use these 25 empty pens to create new pens. 
   - For every 5 empty pens, he can create 1 new pen.
   - So, he can calculate how many new pens he can create by dividing the number of empty pens by 5.

1. **Understanding John's candies**:
   - We know that John has 54 candies.

2. **Finding Robert's candies**:
   - According to the problem, John has twice as many candies as Robert. 
   - We can express this relationship mathematically:
     \[
     J = 2R
     \]
     where \( J \) is the number of candies John has and \( R \) is the number of candies Robert has.
   - Since \( J = 54 \), we can set up the equation:
     \[
     54 = 2R
     \]
   - To find \( R \), we divide both sides by 2:
     \[
     R = \frac{54}{2} = 27
     \]
   - So, Robert has 27 candies.

3. **Finding James's candies**:
   - The problem states that James has 6 more candies than Robert. 
   - We can express this as:
     \[
     Jm = R + 6
     \]
     where \( Jm \) is the number of candies James has.
   - Substituting \( R = 27 \):
     \[
     Jm = 27 + 6 = 33
     \]
   - So, James has 33 candies.

4. **Calculating how many more candies John has than James**:
   - We want to find the difference between the number of candies John has and the number of candies James has:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = J - Jm = 54 - 33

   - Since Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today and he killed 12 cougars, the number of wolves killed today is:
     - \(3 \times 12 = 36\) wolves.

4. **Total Animals Killed Today:**
   - Now, we can calculate the total number of animals killed today:
     - Total = Number of wolves + Number of cougars
     - Total = \(36 + 12 = 48\).

5. **Overall Total Animals Killed:**
   - To find the overall total of animals killed (last night and today):
     - Total killed = Total from last night + Total from today
     - Total killed = \(25 + 48 = 73\).

1. **Determine the total number of solid 10-foot sections in a 200-foot tall redwood tree.**
   - The tree is 200 feet tall and each section is 10 feet.
   - To find the number of sections, we divide the total height by the height of each section:
     \[
     \text{Number of sections} = \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total weight of the uninfested redwood tree.**
   - Each section weighs 400 pounds.
   - Therefore, the total weight of the entire tree without any damage is:
     \[
     \text{Total weight} = \text{Number of sections} \times \text{Weight per section} = 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds}
     \]

3. **Determine the amount of wood eaten by termites.**
   - The termites ate 30% of the wood.
   - To find the weight of the wood eaten, we calculate 30% of the total weight:
     \[

1. **Determine the number of M&Ms in each bag:**
   - The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
   - The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag. So, we calculate the number of M&Ms in the second bag:
     \[
     \text{M&Ms in the second bag} = 300 + 12 = 312
     \]
   - The third bag has a hole in it and only has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had. So, we calculate the number of M&Ms in the third bag:
     \[
     \text{M&Ms in the third bag} = \frac{300}{2} = 150
     \]

2. **Now, we will add up the M&Ms from all three bags:**
   - First bag: 300 M&Ms
   - Second bag: 312 M&Ms
   - Third bag: 150 M&Ms
   - Total M&Ms:
     \[
     \text{Total} = 300 + 312 + 150
     \]

3. **Perform the arithmetic:**
   - First, add the first two bags:
     \[
     300 + 312 = 612
     \]
   - Now add the third bag:
     \[
     612 + 150 = 762

1. **Understanding the current ages**: Mico and Marco's current ages add up to 20. This can be represented mathematically as:
   - Let Mico's age be \( x \) and Marco's age be \( y \).
   - From the problem, we have the equation: \( x + y = 20 \).

2. **Determining the future ages**: In 10 years, both Mico and Marco will be 10 years older. Thus:
   - Mico's age in 10 years will be \( x + 10 \).

   \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
   \[
   R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Now, let's substitute the first equation into the second equation:

Substituting \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
\]

Now, we will expand the right side of the equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

   Ali's medals = 22  
   Izzy's medals = Ali's medals - 5  
   Izzy's medals = 22 - 5 = 17  

   So, Izzy has 17 medals.

2. Next, we need to find out how many medals they have together. We add the number of medals Ali has to the number of medals Izzy has.

   Total medals = Ali's medals + Izzy's medals  
   Total medals = 22 + 17 = 39  

3. According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total medals given out for counting. We can denote the total number of medals given out for counting as \( x \).

   The statement says:  
   Total medals = \( \frac{x}{10} \)  
   So we set up the equation:  
   39 = \( \frac{x}{10} \)

gsm8k,gsm8k-303,SA,1,"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

1. **Identify the total number of books and the current year’s sales:**
   - Total books = 250
   - Unsold books = 50
   - Thus, sold books = Total books - Unsold books = 250 - 50 = 200 books.

2. **Determine the sales number for the current year:**
   - Current year’s sales = 45 books.

3. **Calculate the total number of books sold in previous years:**
   - Total books sold = 200 books.
   - Books sold in the first year: Let’s denote the number of books sold in the current year as \( C \), which is 45. 
   - According to the problem, Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she did in the current year. Therefore, books sold in the first year = \( 2C = 2 \times 45 = 90 \) books.
   - Let \( S \) be the number of books sold in the second year. 

4. **Set up an equation for total books sold:**
   - Total books sold = Books sold in first year + Books sold in second year + Books sold in current year.
   - This gives us the equation: \( 90 + S + 45 = 200 \).

5. **Solve for \( S \):**
   - Combine the numbers: \( 90 + 45 = 135 \).
   - So, \( 135 + S = 200 \).
   - Subtract 135 from both sides: \( S = 200 - 135 = 65 \) books.

6. **Calculate the total earnings in the second year:**
   - Each book sells for $20.
   - Total earnings in the second year = Number of books sold in second year × Price per book
   - Total earnings in the second year = \( 65 \times 20 = 1300 \).

1. **Calculate Watson's weekly earnings from his hourly wage:**
   - Watson works 10 hours a day.
   - He works 5 days a week.
   - His hourly wage is $10.

   First, we calculate the number of hours he works in a week:
   \[
   10 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 50 \text{ hours/week}
   \]

   Now, we calculate his earnings from these hours:
   \[
   50 \text{ hours/week} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 500 \text{ dollars/week}
   \]

2. **Add the weekly bonus to his weekly earnings:**
   - Watson receives a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well.

   So, his total earnings for one week are:
   \[
   500 \text{ dollars/week} + 300 \text{ dollars/week} = 800 \text{ dollars/week}
   \]

3. **Determine how many weeks are in April:**
   - April has 30 days.
   - Since Watson works 5 days a week, we calculate the number of weeks in April:
   \[
   \frac{30 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} \approx 4.29 \text{ weeks}
   \]
   However, since he works 5 days a week, we can count the working weeks as:
   - The number of working days in April is 20 (from 5 working days per week for 4 weeks).
   - Therefore, there are 4 full weeks of work in April.

4. **Calculate Watson's total earnings for April:**
   - Since there are 4 full weeks in April, we multiply his weekly earnings by 4:
   \[
   800 \text{ dollars/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 3200 \text{ dollars}

2. **Determine the percentage of people he beat**: John beats 80% of the people he arm wrestles.

3. **Calculate the number of people he beat**: 
   - To find 80% of 20, we can use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Number of people beaten} = \text{Total people} \times \frac{\text{Percentage}}{100}
     \]
   - Plugging in the values:

     \text{Number of people beaten} = 20 \times \frac{80}{100} = 20 \times 0.8 = 16
     \]

4. **Find the number of people he lost to**:
   - Since he arm wrestled 20 people in total and beat 16, the number of people he lost to is:
     \[
     \text{Number of people lost to} = \text{Total people} - \text{Number of people beaten}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:

     \[
     \text{Joey's weekly weight loss} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds/week}
     \]

2. **Determine how much weight Sandy wants to lose:**
   - Sandy wants to lose the same amount of weight as Joey does in 4 weeks, which is 8 pounds.

3. **Determine Sandy's weight loss rate:**
   - Sandy takes 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week.
   - This means that Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks.
   - To find out how much she loses in 1 week, we divide by 4:
     \[
     \text{Sandy's weekly weight loss} = \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds/week}
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds:**
   - To find out how many weeks it takes for Sandy to lose 8 pounds, we divide the total weight loss by her weekly weight loss:
     \[
     \text{Weeks for Sandy} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{0.5 \text{ pounds/week}} = 16 \text{ weeks}

1. **Understanding the growth of limbs**:
   - The serum causes a person to grow an extra arm every 3 days.
   - The serum causes a person to grow an extra leg every 5 days.

2. **Calculating the number of arms grown**:
   - We need to determine how many 3-day intervals are in 15 days. 
   - To find this, we divide 15 by 3:
     \[
     15 \div 3 = 5

   Now, we need to find out how much Theo can actually spend on his business-related expenses and gifts:
   \[
   \text{Amount available for spending} = \text{Total Budget} - \text{Amount to Save}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Amount available for spending} = 6000 - 2000 = 4000
   \]

3. **Calculating Expenses**: Next, we calculate the total expenses for the business suits, suitcases, and flight ticket.

   - **Cost of Business Suits**: He buys 6 suits at $100 each.
   \[
   \text{Cost of Business Suits} = 6 \times 100 = 600
   \]

   - **Cost of Suitcases**: He buys 3 suitcases at $50 each.
   \[
   \text{Cost of Suitcases} = 3 \times 50 = 150
   \]

   - **Cost of Flight Ticket**: The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. The cost of one business suit is $100, so:
   \[
   \text{Cost of Flight Ticket} = 5 \times 100 + 700 = 500 + 700 = 1200

   - We know that Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.
   - At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera. Therefore, six years ago, Noah's age was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.
   - So, Noah's current age is 20 + 6 = 26 years old.

2. **Population of Chile six years ago:**
   - We are told that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old.

1. **Define the Variables**:
   - Let \( d \) represent the number of players on the defense.
   - According to the problem, there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense. Therefore, the number of players on the offense \( o \) can be expressed as \( o = 2d \).
   - The problem also states that there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense. Thus, the number of players on special teams \( s \) can be expressed as \( s = \frac{1}{2}d \).

2. **Total Members**:
   - The total number of members in the team is given as 105. This means we can write the equation:
   \[
   o + d + s = 105
   \]

3. **Substituting the Variables**:
   - Now substitute \( o \) and \( s \) with their expressions in terms of \( d \):
   \[
   2d + d + \frac{1}{2}d = 105
   \]

4. **Combine Like Terms**:
   - Combine the terms on the left side:
   \[
   2d + d = 3d
   \]
   Therefore, the equation becomes:
   \[
   3d + \frac{1}{2}d = 105
   \]

5. **Convert to a Common Denominator**:
   - To combine \( 3d \) and \( \frac{1}{2}d \), convert \( 3d \) into a fraction with a common denominator:
   \[
   3d = \frac{6}{2}d
   \]
   Now we can write:
   \[
   \frac{6}{2}d + \frac{1}{2}d = 105
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   \frac{7}{2}d = 105
   \]

6. **Solve for \( d \)**:
   - To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 2:
   \[
   7d = 210
   \]
   Now divide both sides by 7:
   \[

1. **Understanding the Ratio**: We are given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires as 1:3. This means for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires.

2. **Identifying the Total Wires**: We know the total number of electric wires needed is 45.

3. **Setting Up the Relationship**: Since the ratio is 1:3, we can express the number of electric poles (let’s denote it as P) and the number of electric wires (denote it as W) in terms of the ratio:
   - If P represents the number of poles, then the number of wires can be expressed as:
     - W = 3P

4. **Using Given Information**: We substitute the known value of wires into the equation:
   - W = 3P
   - 45 = 3P

5. **Solving for P**: To find the number of poles, we solve for P:
   - P = 45 / 3
   - P = 15

6. **Conclusion**: The total number of electric poles needed is 15.

1. **Initial Count of People**:
   - There were 25 men and 15 women at the party.
   - Total number of people initially = 25 men + 15 women = 40 people.

2. **People Who Left**:
   - After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left.
   - Number of people who left = (1/4) * 40 = 10 people.

3. **People Who Stayed**:
   - Total number of people who stayed = Total people - People who left = 40 - 10 = 30 people.
   - We know that 22 men stayed at the party.

4. **Calculating Women Who Stayed**:
   - If 22 men stayed, then the number of women who stayed can be calculated as follows:
   - Number of women who stayed = Total people who stayed - Men who stayed = 30 - 22 = 8 women.

5. **Final Count of Women**:

   - Jam has 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils.
   - We need to figure out how many pencils are in each box. We know that the total number of pencils Jam has is 26. 
   - So, if we let \( x \) be the number of pencils in each box, we can express this as:
     \[
     3x + 2 = 26
     \]
   - Now, we can solve for \( x \):

1. **Understanding the effects of ice cubes:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - Each ice cube also makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   
2. **Calculating the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees:**
   - To find out how many ice cubes are needed to achieve a cooling of 65 degrees, we divide the total cooling needed by the cooling effect of one ice cube:
     \[
     \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]

3. **Calculating the weakening effect of the ice cubes:**
   - Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, we calculate the total weakening from 5 ice cubes:
     \[
     \text{Weakening from ice cubes} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

4. **Considering the addition of cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee. Since the problem statement indicates that any added liquid weakens the coffee, we assume the cream has a weakening effect equivalent to its volume:
     \[
     \text{Weakening from cream} = 15 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

5. **Calculating the total weakening effect:**
   - Now, we sum the weakening effects from both the ice cubes and the cream:
     \[
     \text{Total weakening} = 60 \text{ milliliters (from ice cubes)} + 15 \text{ milliliters (from cream)} = 75 \text{ milliliters}

1. **Determine how many hot dogs Luke ate**:  
   Luke ate 2 hot dogs.

2. **Calculate how many hot dogs Thomas ate**:  
   Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke.  
   So, we calculate:  
   Thomas's hot dogs = 3 × Luke's hot dogs = 3 × 2 = 6 hot dogs.

3. **Calculate how many hot dogs John ate**:

1. **Understanding the groups**: We have three groups of students. Let's denote the number of students in each group as follows:
   - Group A: x (the first equal group)
   - Group B: x (the second equal group)
   - Group C: y (the smallest group)

2. **Relation between groups**: According to the problem, the smallest group (Group C) has 10 students less than each of the other groups. This gives us the equation:
   - y = x - 10

3. **Total number of students**: The total number of students in all groups is given as 200. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   - x + x + y = 200
   - Simplifying this gives us:
   - 2x + y = 200

4. **Substituting the equation for y**: Now, we will substitute the expression for y (from step 2) into the total equation:
   - 2x + (x - 10) = 200
   - This simplifies to:
   - 3x - 10 = 200

5. **Solving for x**: Adding 10 to both sides gives us:
   - 3x = 210
   - Dividing both sides by 3 gives us:
   - x = 70

6. **Finding y**: Now that we have x, we can find y using the equation y = x - 10:
   - y = 70 - 10 = 60

So, the number of students in the smallest group (Group C) is 60.

gsm8k,gsm8k-339,SA,1,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Define variables**:
   - Let \( c \) be the number of cows.
   - Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens \( h \) can be expressed as \( h = 2c \).

2. **Set up the equation**:
   - The total number of animals (chickens + cows) is 60. Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     h + c = 60
     \]
   - Substituting \( h \) with \( 2c \) gives us:
     \[
     2c + c = 60
     \]
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     3c = 60
     \]

3. **Solve for \( c \)**:
   - Dividing both sides by 3:
     \[
     c = \frac{60}{3} = 20
     \]
   - Thus, the number of cows is 20.

4. **Calculate the number of chickens**:
   - Using the equation \( h = 2c \):
     \[
     h = 2 \times 20 = 40
     \]
   - Therefore, there are 40 chickens.

5. **Calculate the total number of legs**:
   - Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each.
   - The total number of legs from cows is:
     \[
     \text{Legs from cows} = 4 \times c = 4 \times 20 = 80
     \]
   - The total number of legs from chickens is:
     \[
     \text{Legs from chickens} = 2 \times h = 2 \times 40 = 80
     \]
   - Adding both gives the total number of legs:
     \[
     \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 = 160

1. **Initial Juggling Practice**:
   - Josh starts practicing juggling with 3 balls.

2. **Adding Balls Each Week**:
   - He adds 1 ball to his juggling act each week.
   - Therefore, the number of balls he juggles at the end of each week is:
     - Week 1: 3 + 1 = 4 balls
     - Week 2: 4 + 1 = 5 balls
     - Week 3: 5 + 1 = 6 balls
     - Week 4: 6 + 1 = 7 balls

   So, by the end of the fourth week, Josh is juggling 7 balls.

3. **Balls Dropped on Stage**:
   - When Josh walks on stage, he slips and drops 3 balls.
   - He originally has 7 balls, and he drops 3 of them.

4. **Calculating Remaining Balls**:
   - To find out how many balls he has left after dropping 3, we subtract:
     - 7 (initial balls) - 3 (dropped balls) = 4 balls remaining.

5. **Loss of One Ball**:
   - Out of the 3 balls dropped, 2 are caught by people in the crowd, but 1 gets lost completely.
   - Since he dropped 3 balls and lost 1, we need to account for that.
   - After losing 1 ball from the 4 he had remaining:
     - 4 (remaining balls) - 1 (lost ball) = 3 balls.

6. **Final Count of Balls**:
   - Therefore, when Josh starts to juggle on stage, he has 3 balls.

   \text{Weight of yellow snake} = \text{Weight of pink frog} + 10 = 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ pounds}
   \]

5. **Weight of the red bird**: 
   The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird. Thus, we can calculate the weight of the red bird:
   \[
   \text{Weight of red bird} = \text{Weight of pink frog} - 20 = 50 - 20 = 30 \text{ pounds}
   \]

6. **Total weight of the animals**: 
   Now we can find the total weight of one of each animal (pink frog, blue beetle, green toad, yellow snake, and red bird):
   - Pink frog = 50 pounds
   - Blue beetle = 50 pounds
   - Green toad = 50 pounds
   - Yellow snake = 60 pounds
   - Red bird = 30 pounds

   Let's add these weights together:

1. We know that Carver's current age is 45 years old.
2. The problem states that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. We can express this relationship mathematically.
3. Let the age of Carver's son be represented by \( x \).
4. According to the information, we can formulate the equation:
   \[
   45 = 2x - 5
   \]
   Here, \( 2x \) represents twice the age of his son, and subtracting 5 gives us Carver's age.

5. Now, we will solve the equation for \( x \):
   - First, add 5 to both sides of the equation:
   \[
   45 + 5 = 2x
   \]
   \[
   50 = 2x
   \]

   - Next, divide both sides by 2 to isolate \( x \):

### Step 1: Calculate the distances between the cities.

1. **Distance from the first city to the second city**:  
   This distance is given as 75 miles.

2. **Distance from the second city to the third city**:  
   This distance is given as 100 miles.

3. **Distance from the third city back to the first city**:  
   We need to calculate this distance.  
   The combined distance from the first city to the second city and the second city to the third city is:  
   \( 75 \text{ miles} + 100 \text{ miles} = 175 \text{ miles} \)  
   The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than this combined distance:  
   \( 175 \text{ miles} - 50 \text{ miles} = 125 \text{ miles} \)

### Step 2: Calculate the total distance for one complete trip.

Now, we add the distances for one complete trip (first city to second city, second city to third city, and third city back to first city):  
- Distance from first to second: 75 miles  
- Distance from second to third: 100 miles  
- Distance from third to first: 125 miles  

Total distance for one trip:  
\( 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles} \)

### Step 3: Calculate the total distance traveled in one day.

The train makes this complete trip 3 times a day. Therefore, the total distance traveled in one day is:  
\( 300 \text{ miles/trip} \times 3 \text{ trips/day} = 900 \text{ miles/day} \)

### Step 4: Determine how many days the train travels between services.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it will go between services, we divide the total mileage until service by the daily mileage:  
\( 18,000 \text{ miles} \div 900 \text{ miles/day} = 20 \text{ days} \)

Thus, the train goes for **20 days** between services.

gsm8k,gsm8k-362,SA,1,"1. First, we need to determine the amount of stuffing required for each type of dog bed:

   - A bed for a Rottweiler takes 8 pounds of stuffing.
   - A bed for a chihuahua takes 2 pounds of stuffing.
   - A bed for a collie takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed.

   To find the average amount of stuffing for the collie bed, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds (Rottweiler)} + 2 \text{ pounds (Chihuahua)}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]

   So, a collie bed takes 5 pounds of stuffing.

2. Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the specified number of beds:

   - For 4 chihuahua beds:
   \[
   \text{Stuffing for chihuahua beds} = 4 \text{ beds} \times 2 \text{ pounds/bed} = 8 \text{ pounds}
   \]

   - For 3 collie beds:
   \[
   \text{Stuffing for collie beds} = 3 \text{ beds} \times 5 \text{ pounds/bed} = 15 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. Now, we add the total stuffing required for both types of beds:
\[
\text{Total stuffing} = \text{Stuffing for chihuahua beds} + \text{Stuffing for collie beds}
\]
\[
\text{Total stuffing} = 8 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, Mark needs a total of 23 pounds of stuffing to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

1. **Distance to friend's house:** 200 miles
2. **Detour added:** 10 miles
3. **Total distance to friend's house:** 200 miles + 10 miles = 210 miles
4. **Speed while driving to friend's house:** 70 mph

Now, we can calculate the time taken using the formula:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]
So the time taken to get to the friend's house is:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the time taken to drive back home

1. **Distance back home:** 240 miles
2. **Speed while driving back home:** 80 mph

Again, using the formula for time:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]
The time taken to get back home is:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total trip time

Now, we add the time taken to get to the friend's house and the time taken to return home:
\[
\text{Total Trip Time} = \text{Time to friend's house} + \text{Time back home}
\]
\[
\text{Total Trip Time} = 3 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours}

1. **Determine the interest amount**: 
   - Karan borrowed $3,650 for 5 months at an interest rate of 10% per annum. 
   - Since the interest is calculated for a period of 5 months, we need to adjust the annual interest rate to a monthly rate.
   - Monthly interest rate = Annual interest rate / 12 months = 10% / 12 = 0.8333% per month.

2. **Calculate the total interest for 5 months**:
   - First, convert 0.8333% to decimal for calculation: 
     - 0.8333% = 0.008333.
   - Now, calculate the total interest for 5 months:
     - Total interest = Principal amount × Monthly interest rate × Number of months
     - Total interest = $3,650 × 0.008333 × 5 
     - Total interest = $3,650 × 0.041665 = $152.08 (approximately).

3. **Calculate the total amount to be repaid**:
   - Total amount to be repaid = Principal amount + Total interest
   - Total amount to be repaid = $3,650 + $152.08 = $3,802.08.

4. **Determine the monthly payment**:
   - Since Karan has to pay this total amount over 5 months, we divide the total amount by the number of months:
   - Monthly payment = Total amount to be repaid / Number of months
   - Monthly payment = $3,802.08 / 5 = $760.416 (approximately).

5. **Final answer**:
   - Rounding to two decimal places, Karan has to pay approximately $760.42 per month.

     \]
   - Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha to buy tickets for all rides is:
     \[
     9 \text{ rides} \times 4 \text{ dollars/ride} = 36 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Cost of the Ride Bracelet for David:**
   - The cost of the ride bracelet is $30, which allows for unlimited rides (in this case, 9 rides).
   
3. **Calculating the Savings:**
   - Now we need to find out how much David saves compared to Dasha. We subtract the cost of the ride bracelet from the total cost of tickets:
     \[
     \text{Savings} = \text{Cost of tickets for Dasha} - \text{Cost of ride bracelet for David}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Savings} = 36 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, David saves $6 by purchasing the ride bracelet instead of buying tickets like Dasha.

1. **Understanding the Ratio**: 
   - The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is given as 5:6. This means that for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles.
   - We can represent the number of popsicles Betty has as 5x and the number of popsicles Sam has as 6x, where x is a common multiplier.

2. **Setting Up the Total**:
   - According to the problem, the total number of popsicles they have together is 165. 
   - Therefore, we can write the equation: 
     \( 5x + 6x = 165 \)

3. **Combining Like Terms**:
   - Combine the terms on the left side:
     \( 11x = 165 \)

4. **Solving for x**:
   - To find x, divide both sides of the equation by 11:
     \( x = \frac{165}{11} \)
     \( x = 15 \)

5. **Calculating the Number of Popsicles**:
   - Now we can find out how many popsicles each person has:
     - Betty's popsicles: 
       \( 5x = 5 \times 15 = 75 \)
     - Sam's popsicles: 
       \( 6x = 6 \times 15 = 90 \)

6. **Finding the Difference**:
   - To find how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number Sam has:
     \( 90 - 75 = 15 \)

Thus, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

1. **Initial Information**: 
   - Allan has 40 cannolis.
   - He has twice as much corn as cannolis.

2. **Calculating the amount of corn**:
   - If he has twice as much corn as cannolis, we can calculate the corn as follows:
     \[
     \text{Corn} = 2 \times \text{Cannolis} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ corn}
     \]

3. **Total before buying more**:
   - So initially, Allan has:
     - Cannolis: 40
     - Corn: 80
   - The total before buying more is:
     \[
     \text{Total} = \text{Cannolis} + \text{Corn} = 40 + 80 = 120
     \]

4. **Purchasing more cannolis**:
   - Allan buys 60 more cannolis:
     \[
     \text{New Cannolis} = 40 + 60 = 100 \text{ cannolis}
     \]

5. **Calculating the new amount of corn**:
   - Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he now has. The number of corns he will have is:
     \[
     \text{New Corn} = \text{New Cannolis} - 40 = 100 - 40 = 60 \text{ corn}
     \]

6. **Calculating the final totals**:
   - Now Allan has:
     - Cannolis: 100
     - Corn: 60
   - The new total is:
     \[
     \text{New Total} = \text{New Cannolis} + \text{New Corn} = 100 + 60 = 160
     \]

Finally, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:

1. **Total Steps Goal**: Elliott is trying to walk a total of 10,000 steps in a day.

2. **Steps Completed on Walks to School**: He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. This means he completed:
   \[
   \text{Steps from school walks} = \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

3. **Steps from Walk with Friend**: He also took another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend:
   \[
   \text{Total steps so far} = 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

4. **Remaining Steps After Jog**: After his jog, he realized he had only 2,000 steps left to reach his goal. This means before the jog, he had:
   \[
   \text{Steps before jog} = 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

5. **Calculating Steps During Jog**: To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we need to determine how many steps he had completed before the jog and then see how many more he needed to reach that total.
   \[
   \text{Steps taken during jog} = \text{Steps before jog} - \text{Total steps so far}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Steps taken during jog} = 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 \text{ steps}

1. **Calculate the total number of words in the book**:
   - The book has 45 pages, and each page has an average of 200 words.
   - Total words = Number of pages × Words per page
   - Total words = 45 pages × 200 words/page = 9000 words.

2. **Determine how long it will take Toby to read the book**:
   - Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute.
   - Time to read the book = Total words / Reading rate
   - Time to read the book = 9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes.

3. **Determine how much time Toby has before he needs to leave for the airport**:
   - Toby needs to be at the airport in 60 minutes.
   - It takes him 10 minutes to get to the airport.
   - Time available for reading = Total time until departure - Travel time
   - Time available for reading = 60 minutes - 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

4. **Calculate how early Toby will be**:
   - Since it takes Toby 30 minutes to read the book and he has 50 minutes available, we can find out how early he will be.
   - Early time = Time available for reading - Time to read the book
   - Early time = 50 minutes - 30 minutes = 20 minutes.

Thus, Toby will be 20 minutes early.

1. **Calculate the total number of employees in May:**
   - Carolyn's company hired 40 employees in May.

2. **Determine the hourly wage and weekly hours worked:**
   - Each employee is paid $15 per hour.
   - Each employee works for 40 hours in a week.

3. **Calculate the weekly payment for one employee:**
   - Weekly payment for one employee = Hourly wage × Hours worked
   - Weekly payment for one employee = $15 × 40 = $600

4. **Calculate the total payment for all employees in May:**
   - Total payment for 40 employees = Weekly payment for one employee × Number of employees
   - Total payment for 40 employees = $600 × 40 = $24,000

5. **Determine how many employees are left in June:**
   - In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired.
   - Number of employees whose contracts expired = 1/4 × 40 = 10 employees
   - Remaining employees = Total employees - Employees whose contracts expired
   - Remaining employees = 40 - 10 = 30 employees

6. **Calculate the total payment for the remaining employees in June:**
   - Total payment for remaining employees in June = Weekly payment for one employee × Number of remaining employees
   - Total payment for remaining employees in June = $600 × 30 = $18,000

7. **Calculate the total amount paid in May and June:**

1. **Initial Amount**: Sally starts with $10.

2. **Cost of Taffy**:
   - The price for 1 pound of taffy is $3.
   - She buys 2 pounds, so we need to calculate the total cost of the taffy using the ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" offer.
   - The cost for the first pound is $3.
   - The cost for the second pound, which is 1/2 off, is $3 / 2 = $1.50.
   - Total cost for 2 pounds of taffy = $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

3. **Cost of Seashells**: The mixed bag of seashells costs $1.50.

4. **Cost of Magnets**:
   - Each magnet costs $0.25, and she buys 4 magnets.
   - Total cost for magnets = 4 magnets × $0.25/magnet = $1.00.

5. **Total Spending**: Now we can calculate the total amount spent by adding up all the costs:
   - Cost of taffy: $4.50
   - Cost of seashells: $1.50
   - Cost of magnets: $1.00
   - Total spending = $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00.

   - The first package of fireworks costs $400.
   - The second package costs twice as much as the first package. Therefore, the cost of the second package is:
     \[
     2 \times 400 = 800
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost before the discount:**
   - Now, we add the costs of both packages together:
     \[
     400 + 800 = 1200
     \]

3. **Calculate the discount:**
   - Tim receives a 20% discount on the total cost. First, we find out how much the discount is:
     \[
     0.20 \times 1200 = 240
     \]

4. **Calculate the total cost after the discount:**
   - We subtract the discount from the total cost before the discount:

1. **Determine the discount amount for each blouse**: 
   Each blouse has a regular price of $20, and there is a 30% discount. To calculate the discount, we can use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Discount} = \text{Regular Price} \times \text{Discount Rate}
   \]
   Here, the discount rate is 30%, which can be expressed as 0.30. Therefore:
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6
   \]

2. **Calculate the discounted price of each blouse**: 
   Now, we subtract the discount from the regular price:
   \[
   \text{Discounted Price} = \text{Regular Price} - \text{Discount}
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   \text{Discounted Price} = 20 - 6 = 14

     \[
     \frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ apples}
     \]
   - Let \( x \) be the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees.

2. **Calculate the total apples gathered by Joanne:**
   - The total number of apples Joanne gathers is:
     \[
     30 + 15 + x = 45 + x
     \]

3. **Identify the number of apples her sister gathers:**
   - Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne:

     2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ apples}
     \]
   - Her sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne:
     \[
     3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ apples}
     \]
   - Her sister does not gather any apples from the average trees.

4. **Calculate the total apples gathered by her sister:**
   - The total number of apples her sister gathers is:

   - From the problem, we know:
     - There are 180 heads (each animal has one head), so:
       \[
       c + d = 180 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}

     - Camels have 2 humps each, and dromedaries have 1 hump each. The total number of bumps is 304, so:
       \[
       2c + d = 304 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
       \]

3. **Solve the equations**:
   - We can solve Equation 1 for \( d \):
     \[
     d = 180 - c
     \]
   - Now, substitute \( d \) in Equation 2:
     \[
     2c + (180 - c) = 304
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     2c + 180 - c = 304

1. **Distance Traveled in the First 4 Days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day for the first 4 days.
   - Total distance for the first 4 days = 200 km/day * 4 days = 800 kilometers.

2. **Distance Traveled in the Next 2 Days:**
   - Over the next two days, Tom traveled only 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days.
   - 30% of 800 kilometers = 0.30 * 800 km = 240 kilometers.
   - Since this distance is covered over 2 days, the distance per day is not needed for the total distance calculation.

3. **Distance Traveled on the Next Day:**
   - On the next day (the 7th day), Tom wasn't traveling at all, so he traveled 0 kilometers.

4. **Distance Traveled During the Second Week:**
   - For the second week (days 8 to 14), Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days.
   - Total distance for the second week = 300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 kilometers.

5. **Calculating Total Distance:**
   - Total distance = Distance from the first week + Distance from the second week.
   - Total distance = 800 km (first 4 days) + 240 km (next 2 days) + 0 km (7th day) + 2100 km (second week).

   - Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, so we can express Peter's locker as:
     \[
     P = \frac{1}{4}Z
     \]

2. **Substituting values**:
   - We know that Peter's locker \( P \) is 5 cubic inches:
     \[
     P = 5
     \]
   - Substitute \( Z \) in terms of \( T \) into the equation for Peter's locker:
     \[
     5 = \frac{1}{4}Z
     \]
   - Since \( Z = \frac{1}{2}T \), we can substitute \( Z \) into the equation:
     \[
     5 = \frac{1}{4} \left(\frac{1}{2}T\right)
     \]

3. **Simplifying the equation**:
   - First, simplify the right side:
     \[

1. **Identify the pricing periods:**
   - The first 6 months are at $8 per month.
   - The next 8 months are at $12 per month.
   - After these 14 months, the price increases to $14 per month.

2. **Calculate the costs for each period:**
   - **First 6 months:** 
     \[
     \text{Cost for first 6 months} = 6 \text{ months} \times 8 \text{ dollars/month} = 48 \text{ dollars}
     \]
     
   - **Next 8 months:** 
     \[
     \text{Cost for next 8 months} = 8 \text{ months} \times 12 \text{ dollars/month} = 96 \text{ dollars}
     \]
     
   - **Remaining 10 months (24 months total - 14 months already accounted for):** 
     \[
     \text{Cost for remaining 10 months} = 10 \text{ months} \times 14 \text{ dollars/month} = 140 \text{ dollars}

1. **Identify the costs of the jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. Therefore:
     \[
     \text{Cost of jogger jeans} = 28 - 6 = 22 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of both jeans:**
   - Total cost = Cost of tattered jeans + Cost of jogger jeans
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 28 + 22 = 50 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Understand the savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6 on the jeans.

4. **Determine how much he saved from each pair:**
   - According to the problem, he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans.
   - Savings from jogger jeans:
     \[
     \text{Savings from jogger jeans} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Savings from tattered jeans:
     \[
     \text{Savings from tattered jeans} = 6 - 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Calculate the original prices of the jeans before the savings:**
   - Let’s denote the original price of the jogger jeans as \( J \).
   - Since Cole saved $2 on jogger jeans:
     \[
     J - 2 = 22 \implies J = 22 + 2 = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $28.

6. **Find the difference in original prices:**
   - Now, we need to find how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Original price of jogger jeans} - \text{Original price of tattered jeans}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Difference} = 24 - 28 = -4 \text{ dollars}

1. **Cost of the bagel**: The bagel costs $4.

2. **Cost of the soup**: The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. 
   - First, we calculate 25% of the bagel's cost:
     \[
     25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1.
     \]
   - Now, we add this amount to the cost of the bagel:

     \text{Cost of soup} = 4 + 1 = 5.
     \]

3. **Cost of the cake**: The cake costs half of the price of the bagel. 
   - We calculate half of the bagel's cost:
     \[
     \text{Cost of cake} = \frac{4}{2} = 2.
     \]

4. **Total cost of the dinner**: Now we add the costs of all three items together:

1. **Understand the total amount needed**: Kenny needs $100 for the ticket to the amusement park. He also wants to have $50 in spending cash. Therefore, the total amount he needs to have is:
   \[
   \$100 + \$50 = \$150
   \]

2. **Determine how much money he can make from selling his cards**: Kenny sells his Pokemon cards for $1.5 each. However, he keeps 1/3 of his cards, meaning he only sells 2/3 of them.

3. **Let \( x \) be the total number of cards he starts with**. Since he keeps 1/3 of his cards, he sells 2/3 of them. The number of cards he sells is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3}x
   \]

4. **Calculate the total money earned from selling the cards**: The money he earns from selling \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards at $1.5 each is:
   \[
   \text{Money earned} = \left(\frac{2}{3}x\right) \times 1.5
   \]

5. **Set up the equation**: We need this amount to be equal to $150 (the total amount he needs):
   \[
   \left(\frac{2}{3}x\right) \times 1.5 = 150
   \]

6. **Simplify the left side**: Calculate \( \frac{2}{3} \times 1.5 \):

1. **Understanding the Initial Preparation**: The caterer was told to prepare gourmet hot dogs for 36 guests. It is mentioned that most people would eat one hotdog, but he prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs. This means:
   - Half of the guests = 36 / 2 = 18 guests would have 2 hotdogs each.
   - The total number of hotdogs prepared = 18 guests × 2 hotdogs + (36 - 18) guests × 1 hotdog
   - This simplifies to: 18 × 2 + 18 × 1 = 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

2. **Calculating the Number of Guests Who Showed Up**: Now, 40 guests showed up at the event.

3. **Understanding the Demand for Second Hotdogs**: Since everyone who showed up wanted a second hotdog, this means all 40 guests wanted 2 hotdogs each.

4. **Calculating Total Hotdogs Needed**: The total number of hotdogs needed for 40 guests wanting 2 each:
   - Total hotdogs needed = 40 guests × 2 hotdogs = 80 hotdogs.

5. **Finding the Shortage**: The caterer prepared only 54 hotdogs, but 80 are needed:
   - Shortage = Total hotdogs needed - Total hotdogs prepared = 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs.

6. **Calculating How Many Guests Didn't Get a Second Hotdog**: Since each guest who wanted a second hotdog represents one hotdog, the number of guests who did not receive a second hotdog equals the shortage:
   - Therefore, 26 guests did not get a second hotdog.

   - Candy bars cost 75 cents each.
   - George spent a total of $5 (which is 500 cents).
   - He bought 3 bags of chips.

2. **Calculating the Cost of Chips:**
   - The cost of 3 bags of chips is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of chips} = 3 \times 40 \text{ cents} = 120 \text{ cents}
     \]

3. **Calculating the Money Left After Buying Chips:**
   - After buying the chips, the amount of money George has left is:
     \[
     \text{Money left after chips} = 500 \text{ cents} - 120 \text{ cents} = 380 \text{ cents}
     \]

4. **Understanding the Remaining Money:**
   - According to the problem, George had 1% of his money left after his purchases. Since he started with $5 (500 cents), 1% of this is:
     \[
     1\% \text{ of } 500 \text{ cents} = 0.01 \times 500 = 5 \text{ cents}
     \]

5. **Confirming Money Left:**
   - From the previous step, we calculated that he has 380 cents left, but this should equal 5 cents according to the 1% calculation. This indicates a misunderstanding. 

6. **Correctly Calculating the Money Spent on Candy Bars:**
   - If he has 5 cents left, this means he actually spent:
     \[
     \text{Money spent} = 500 \text{ cents} - 5 \text{ cents} = 495 \text{ cents}
     \]

7. **Calculating the Money Spent on Candy Bars:**
   - Since we know he spent 120 cents on chips, the money spent on candy bars is:

     \text{Money spent on candy bars} = 495 \text{ cents} - 120 \text{ cents} = 375 \text{ cents}
     \]

8. **Finding the Number of Candy Bars Bought:**
   - Each candy bar costs 75 cents. Therefore, the number of candy bars George bought is:
     \[
     \text{Number of candy bars} = \frac{375 \text{ cents}}{75 \text{ cents/bar}} = 5

   \text{Cost of beef stock} = 2 \text{ boxes} \times 2 \text{ dollars/box} = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of the ingredients:**
   Now, we add the cost of the onions and the cost of the beef stock:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of onions} + \text{Cost of beef stock} = 8 \text{ dollars} + 4 \text{ dollars} = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Determine the number of servings:**
   The soup serves 6 people.

6. **Calculate the cost per serving:**
   We divide the total cost by the number of servings to find the cost per serving:
   \[
   \text{Cost per serving} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of servings}} = \frac{12 \text{ dollars}}{6} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

1. **Identify Wayne's Travel Time**:
   - Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater.

2. **Calculate Bernadette's Travel Time**:
   - We know that Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's drive.
   - Therefore, Bernadette's travel time = 4 minutes (Wayne's time) * 4 = 16 minutes.

3. **Determine the Time Difference**:
   - Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.
   - Therefore, we need to calculate when Wayne will arrive:
     - Wayne arrives at the theater at 4 minutes after leaving.
   - To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette needs to arrive at:
     - 4 minutes (Wayne's arrival time) - 5 minutes = -1 minute (which means 1 minute before Wayne's arrival).
   
4. **Calculate When Bernadette Needs to Leave**:
   - If Bernadette needs to arrive at -1 minute (1 minute before Wayne's arrival), she needs to leave:
     - Arrival time - Travel time = -1 minute - 16 minutes = -17 minutes.
   - This means Bernadette should leave 17 minutes before Wayne leaves.

5. **Calculate the Time Difference**:
   - Wayne takes 4 minutes to leave, so if he leaves at time T, Bernadette should leave at T - 17 minutes.
   - In order to calculate how much earlier she should leave compared to Wayne, we simply take the difference:
     - 17 minutes earlier than Wayne's departure.

Therefore, the final answer is:

gsm8k,gsm8k-440,SA,1,"To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the length from yards to feet**: Since 1 yard is equivalent to 3 feet, we can convert the length of Billie's room:
   \[
   \text{Length in feet} = 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Use the area to find the width**: The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width}
   \]
   We know that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet. We can rearrange the formula to find the width:
   \[
   \text{Width} = \frac{\text{Area}}{\text{Length}} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Calculate the perimeter**: The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
   \[
   P = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width})
   \]
   Now we can substitute the values we found:
   \[
   P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet}
   \]

Thus, the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom is:

### Step 1: Determine the number of packs each sister bought.
- **Elizabeth**:
  - Red beads: 1 pack
  - Clear beads: 2 packs
  
- **Margareth**:
  - Blue beads: 3 packs
  - Red beads: 4 packs

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of beads for each sister.
Each pack contains 20 beads.

- **Elizabeth's total beads**:
  - Red beads: 1 pack * 20 beads/pack = 20 beads
  - Clear beads: 2 packs * 20 beads/pack = 40 beads
  - Total for Elizabeth = 20 beads (red) + 40 beads (clear) = 60 beads

- **Margareth's total beads**:
  - Blue beads: 3 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 beads
  - Red beads: 4 packs * 20 beads/pack = 80 beads
  - Total for Margareth = 60 beads (blue) + 80 beads (red) = 140 beads

### Step 3: Calculate the difference in the number of beads.
Now we find the difference in the number of beads each sister has.

- Difference = Margareth's total - Elizabeth's total
- Difference = 140 beads - 60 beads = 80 beads

### Conclusion:
Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

1. **Initial Temperature:** Marcus wakes up and the house is at 40 degrees.

2. **Baking Time:** He spends 3 hours baking.
   - The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour.
   - Therefore, in 3 hours, the temperature increase will be:
     \[
     3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees}
     \]

3. **New Temperature After Baking:** We add the temperature increase from baking to the initial temperature:
   \[
   40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees}
   \]

4. **Opening the Window:** After baking, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.
   - In 30 minutes, the number of 10-minute intervals is:
     \[
     \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = 3
     \]
   - The total temperature decrease will then be:
     \[

1. **Calculate Jon's total time for the triathlon**:
   - Swim: 40 minutes
   - Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
   - Run: 50 minutes
   - Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

2. **Determine James's total time**:
   Jon won by 10 minutes, so James's total time is:
   - James's time = Jon's time + 10 minutes = 170 + 10 = 180 minutes

3. **Calculate James's swim time**:
   James swims 10% faster than Jon. To find the time it takes James to swim:
   - Jon's swim speed can be thought of as swimming 40 minutes. If James is 10% faster, he swims 90% of Jon's swim time.
   - James's swim time = 40 minutes * 0.90 = 36 minutes

4. **Calculate James's bike time**:
   According to the problem, James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon.
   - Jon's bike time = 80 minutes
   - James's bike time = 80 + 5 = 85 minutes

5. **Set up the equation for James's total time**:
   We have:
   - Total time for James = James's swim time + James's bike time + James's run time
   - 180 minutes = 36 minutes + 85 minutes + James's run time

6. **Solve for James's run time**:
   \[
   180 = 36 + 85 + \text{James's run time}
   \]
   \[
   180 = 121 + \text{James's run time}
   \]
   \[
   \text{James's run time} = 180 - 121 = 59 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Thus, James took 59 minutes to complete the run.

1. **Understanding the costs**:
   - The cost of a movie super ticket (which includes watching any movie) is $20.
   - If you buy the super ticket, the cost of popcorn and soda combined is $1 extra.
   - Therefore, if you buy the super ticket, the total cost for everything (movie, popcorn, soda) is:
     \[
     20 + 1 = 21 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Regular movie ticket expenses**:
   - The cost of a regular movie ticket is $12.
   - We need to find the regular price of popcorn, denoted as \( p \).
   - The soda costs $3.
   - Therefore, if you buy a regular movie ticket and pay for the popcorn and soda, the total cost will be:
     \[
     12 + p + 3 = 15 + p \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Understanding the savings**:
   - According to the problem, you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket. This means that the total cost of the regular movie ticket (with popcorn and soda) is $2 less than the total cost of the super ticket. 
   - We can set up the equation:
     \[

1. **Calculate the volume of one raised bed**:
   - Each raised bed has dimensions of 2 feet in width, 8 feet in length, and 2 feet in height.
   - The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (like a raised bed) is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height}
     \]
   - So, for one raised bed:
     \[
     V = 8 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total volume for all 10 raised beds**:
   - Since Bob has 10 raised beds, we multiply the volume of one bed by 10:
     \[
     \text{Total Volume} = 10 \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet}
     \]

3. **Determine how many bags of potting soil are needed**:
   - Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet. To find out how many bags Bob needs, we divide the total volume by the volume of one bag:
     \[
     \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet/bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of the potting soil**:
   - Each bag costs $12. Therefore, the total cost can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = 160 \times 12 = 1920
     \]

Now, we can conclude the final answer:

1. **Find the number of green cards**:
   - We are given that there are 15 red cards.
   - We need to find the number of green cards, and it is stated that there are 60% more green cards than red cards.
   - To find the number of green cards, we calculate 60% of 15:
     \[
     60\% \text{ of } 15 = 0.60 \times 15 = 9
     \]
   - Now, we add this amount to the original 15 red cards to find the total number of green cards:
     \[
     \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + 9 = 24
     \]

2. **Find the number of yellow cards**:
   - Yellow cards are as many as the sum of red and green cards.
   - We first calculate the total number of red and green cards:
     \[
     \text{Total red and green cards} = 15 + 24 = 39
     \]
   - Therefore, the number of yellow cards is also 39.

3. **Calculate the total number of cards**:
   - Now, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards together:
     \[
     \text{Total cards} = \text{red cards} + \text{green cards} + \text{yellow cards}
     \]

1. **Understanding the relationship between cookies and carrot sticks**:
   - Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room.
   - We can express this mathematically. Let \( c \) be the number of carrot sticks Matt eats. Then the number of cookies \( k \) he can have is:
     \[
     k = \frac{1}{2}c + 2
     \]

2. **Setting up the equation**:
   - We know that Matt wants to eat a total of 5 cookies. So, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2
     \]

3. **Solving for \( c \)**:
   - First, we will isolate \( \frac{1}{2}c \) on one side. To do this, subtract 2 from both sides:
     \[
     5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c
     \]
     \[
     3 = \frac{1}{2}c
     \]

   - Next, to solve for \( c \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
     \[
     2 \cdot 3 = c
     \]
     \[
     c = 6
     \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

1. **Understanding the Lengths**:
   - The shark is 10 feet long.
   - Each remora is 6 inches long. Since there are 2 remoras, we need to calculate their total length in inches first.

2. **Convert Shark's Length to Inches**:
   - There are 12 inches in a foot.
   - Therefore, the length of the shark in inches is:
     \[
     10 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 120 \text{ inches}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Total Length of the Remoras**:
   - Each remora is 6 inches, and there are 2 of them:
     \[
     2 \times 6 \text{ inches} = 12 \text{ inches}
     \]

4. **Calculate the Percentage**:
   - To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras represent, we use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Length of Remoras}}{\text{Length of Shark}} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - Plugging in our values:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100
     \]

5. **Perform the Arithmetic**:
   - First, divide 12 by 120:
     \[
     \frac{12}{120} = 0.1
     \]
   - Next, multiply by 100 to convert to percentage:
     \[
     0.1 \times 100 = 10
     \]

Thus, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

   \text{Cost of family-size pizza} = 3 \times \text{Cost of small pizza} = 3 \times 8 = 24
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount spent**: 
   To find the total amount spent, we add the cost of the small pizza and the cost of the family-size pizza together:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of small pizza} + \text{Cost of family-size pizza} = 8 + 24
   \]
   Performing the addition:
   \[
   8 + 24 = 32
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, the total amount Sally spends is $32.

gsm8k,gsm8k-493,SA,1,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the Purchase**:
   - Heather wants to buy 2 packs of razors.
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - Therefore, buying 2 packs means she will have:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times 4 \text{ razors/pack} = 8 \text{ razors}
     \]

2. **Calculating the Cost Before Discounts**:
   - The cost of one pack of razors is $4.00.
   - So, the cost for 2 packs is:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times 4.00 \text{ dollars/pack} = 8.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Applying the Sale Discount**:
   - The razors are on sale for buy one get one free.
   - This means that when Heather buys 2 packs, she only pays for 1 pack.
   - Thus, she will only pay:
     \[
     4.00 \text{ dollars} \quad (\text{for 1 pack})
     \]

4. **Applying the Coupon**:
   - Heather has a $2.00 coupon.
   - After applying the coupon, the total cost will be:
     \[
     4.00 \text{ dollars} - 2.00 \text{ dollars} = 2.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Calculating the Final Cost Per Razor**:
   - Now, she has paid $2.00 for 8 razors.
   - To find the cost per razor, we divide the total cost by the number of razors:
     \[
     \frac{2.00 \text{ dollars}}{8 \text{ razors}} = 0.25 \text{ dollars/razor}
     \]

6. **Converting to Cents**:
   - Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, we convert the cost per razor to cents:
     \[
     0.25 \text{ dollars} \times 100 \text{ cents/dollar} = 25 \text{ cents/razor}
     \]

Finally, the cost of each individual razor, after the discount, is:

gsm8k,gsm8k-494,SA,1,"To determine the total height of the human pyramid formed by the cheerleaders, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the heights of the cheerleaders:**
   - 9 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall.
   - 1 cheerleader is 60 inches tall.

2. **Determine the structure of the pyramid:**
   - The pyramid consists of:
     - 4 cheerleaders on the bottom layer.
     - 3 cheerleaders on the second layer.
     - 2 cheerleaders on the third layer.
     - 1 cheerleader (the shortest) on the top layer.

3. **Calculate the total height of each layer:**
   - The bottom layer has 4 cheerleaders, and since they are all 64 inches tall, the height of the bottom layer is:
     - Height of bottom layer = 64 inches (since they all stand on the ground and their combined height doesn't stack).
   - The second layer has 3 cheerleaders, who will stand on the shoulders of the bottom layer. They are also 64 inches tall:
     - Height of second layer = 64 inches (they also do not add height in terms of stacking, as they are on top of the bottom layer).
   - The third layer has 2 cheerleaders, who are also 64 inches tall:
     - Height of third layer = 64 inches (same reasoning).
   - The top layer has the shortest cheerleader, who is 60 inches tall:
     - Height of top layer = 60 inches.

4. **Add the heights of all the layers:**
   - Total height of the pyramid = Height of bottom layer + Height of second layer + Height of third layer + Height of top layer
   - Total height = 64 inches + 64 inches + 64 inches + 60 inches
   - Total height = 64 + 64 + 64 + 60 = 252 inches.

5. **Convert the total height from inches to feet:**
   - There are 12 inches in a foot. To convert inches to feet:
   - Total height in feet = Total height in inches ÷ 12
   - Total height in feet = 252 ÷ 12 = 21 feet.

Therefore, the height of the human pyramid is:

   In four years, Brett will be:  
   14 + 4 = 18 years old.

3. **Understand Angela's age in relation to Brett's current age:**  
   The problem states that in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Since Brett is currently 14 years old, we need to find Angela's age such that in four years, she will be three times that.

4. **Calculate three times Brett's current age:**  
   Three times Brett's current age is:  
   3 × 14 = 42 years old.

5. **Set up the equation for Angela's age:**  
   Let Angela's current age be represented as \( A \). In four years, Angela will be:  
   \( A + 4 \). 

   We want to find \( A \) such that:  
   \( A + 4 = 42 \).

6. **Solve for Angela's current age:**

gsm8k,gsm8k-499,SA,1,"To determine how many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to define the total cost for each venue based on the number of guests.

Let's denote the number of guests as \( x \).

1. **Cost of the first venue:**
   - The first venue has a flat fee of $200.
   - Since it does not include food, we need to add the cost of food, which is $5 per person.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the first venue can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{Cost}_{\text{first venue}} = 200 + 5x
     \]

2. **Cost of the second venue:**
   - The second venue charges $25 per person, and this includes food.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the second venue can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{Cost}_{\text{second venue}} = 25x
     \]

3. **Setting the costs equal:**
   To find out when the costs of both venues are equal, we set the two cost equations equal to each other:
   \[
   200 + 5x = 25x
   \]

4. **Solving the equation:**
   - First, we can subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
     \[
     200 = 25x - 5x
     \]
     \[
     200 = 20x
     \]
   - Next, we divide both sides by 20 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{200}{20}
     \]
     \[
     x = 10
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   We find that the two venues will have equal costs when there are 10 guests.

gsm8k,gsm8k-500,SA,1,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Set Up Variables**: 
   - Let \( D \) represent the number of insects David found.
   - Since Lily found 7 more than David, we can express the number of insects Lily found as \( L = D + 7 \).
   - Since David found half of what Bodhi found, we can express Bodhi's insects as \( B = 2D \).

2. **Write the Total Equation**: 
   - According to the problem, the total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   L + D + B = 43
   \]
   Substituting our expressions for \( L \) and \( B \) into the equation gives:
   \[
   (D + 7) + D + (2D) = 43
   \]

3. **Combine Like Terms**: 
   - Simplifying the equation, we get:
   \[
   D + 7 + D + 2D = 43
   \]
   \[
   4D + 7 = 43
   \]

4. **Solve for \( D \)**: 
   - Now, we will isolate \( D \) by first subtracting 7 from both sides:
   \[
   4D = 43 - 7
   \]
   \[
   4D = 36
   \]
   - Next, we divide by 4:
   \[
   D = \frac{36}{4} = 9
   \]

5. **Find \( L \) and \( B \)**: 
   - Now that we have \( D \), we can find \( L \) and \( B \):
   \[
   L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16
   \]
   \[
   B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18
   \]

6. **Check the Total**: 
   - Finally, we can check if the values add up to 43:
   \[
   L + D + B = 16 + 9 + 18 = 43
   \]
   - The values are consistent with the problem statement.

1. **Identify the amount of yarn used by each person**: 
   - Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein.
   - Her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein.

2. **Convert the fractions of skeins to yards**:
   - We know that there are 364 yards in one skein.
   - First, we calculate how many yards Mariah used:
     \[
     \text{Yards used by Mariah} = \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = \frac{364}{4} = 91 \text{ yards}

1. **Understanding the costs and yields**: 
   - A 2 x 4 costs $4 and produces 200 sticks.
   - A 2 x 8 costs $6 and produces 400 sticks.

2. **Calculating the cost per stick**:
   - For a 2 x 4: 
     - Cost per stick = Cost of wood / Number of sticks = $4 / 200 sticks = $0.02 per stick.
   - For a 2 x 8:
     - Cost per stick = $6 / 400 sticks = $0.015 per stick.

3. **Identifying the cheapest lumber**: 
   - The 2 x 8 is cheaper per stick ($0.015) compared to the 2 x 4 ($0.02).

4. **Calculating how many of each type of wood Frederick can buy with $24**:
   - If he only buys 2 x 8 pieces:
     - Maximum number of 2 x 8 pieces he can buy = $24 / $6 = 4 pieces.
     - Total sticks from 4 pieces of 2 x 8 = 4 pieces * 400 sticks/piece = 1600 sticks.

   - If he only buys 2 x 4 pieces:
     - Maximum number of 2 x 4 pieces he can buy = $24 / $4 = 6 pieces.
     - Total sticks from 6 pieces of 2 x 4 = 6 pieces * 200 sticks/piece = 1200 sticks.

5. **Combining the pieces**: 
   - We could also consider a combination of both types of wood to maximize sticks, but since the 2 x 8 gives more sticks for less cost, it is more efficient to buy as many 2 x 8 pieces as possible.

6. **Decision**: 
   - The best option for maximizing the number of popsicle sticks is to buy the maximum number of 2 x 8 pieces.

Thus, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make by spending his $24 on the cheapest lumber is:

     \text{Cows at zoo} = 2 \times \text{Cows at farm} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ cows}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of sheep at the farm:**
   - The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. The zoo has 20 sheep, so the number of sheep at the farm is:
     \[
     \text{Sheep at farm} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Sheep at zoo} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ sheep}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of animals on the farm and zoo:**
   - Total animals on the farm:
     \[
     \text{Total at farm} = \text{Cows} + \text{Sheep} = 30 + 10 = 40 \text{ animals}
     \]
   - Total animals at the zoo:
     \[
     \text{Total at zoo} = \text{Cows} + \text{Sheep} = 60 + 20 = 80 \text{ animals}
     \]

4. **Combine the totals from the farm and zoo:**
   - Total combined animals:
     \[
     \text{Total animals combined} = \text{Total at farm} + \text{Total at zoo} = 40 + 80 = 120
     \]

Thus, the total number of animals on the farm and zoo combined is:

1. **Identify what Rose bought**:
   - Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes.

2. **Calculate the total items Rose bought**:
   - Total items Rose bought = Number of onions + Number of potatoes
   - Total items Rose bought = 12 + 4 = 16 items.

3. **Understand the relationship between what Rose bought and what Sophia bought**:
   - It is given that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.
   - Let \( S \) be the total number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.

4. **Set up the equation based on the relationship**:
   - Since Rose bought 4 times what Sophia bought, we have:
   - \( 4S = 16 \) (because Rose bought 16 items in total).

5. **Solve for \( S \)**:
   - To find \( S \), divide both sides of the equation by 4:
   - \( S = \frac{16}{4} = 4 \).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Therefore, Sophia bought a total of 4 onions and potatoes.

gsm8k,gsm8k-510,SA,1,"To determine how much of a daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his weight loss goal, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total weight loss goal**: Andy wants to lose 30 lbs.

2. **Calculate the total calories to burn**: Since 1 lb of body weight is approximately equivalent to 3500 calories, we can calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 lbs.
   \[
   \text{Total calories to burn} = 30 \text{ lbs} \times 3500 \text{ calories/lb} = 105000 \text{ calories}
   \]

3. **Determine the time frame**: Andy has from December 31st to July 19th to reach his goal. We need to figure out how many days are between these two dates.

   - From December 31 to January 31 = 31 days
   - February (not a leap year) = 28 days
   - March = 31 days
   - April = 30 days
   - May = 31 days
   - June = 30 days
   - From July 1 to July 19 = 19 days

   Now, we sum these numbers to find the total number of days:
   \[
   31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 229 \text{ days}
   \]

4. **Calculate the daily calorie deficit**: To find out how much of a calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve each day, we take the total calories he needs to burn and divide it by the number of days he has to achieve this.
   \[
   \text{Daily calorie deficit} = \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{229 \text{ days}} \approx 459.74 \text{ calories/day}
   \]

5. **Round to the nearest whole number**: Since calorie deficits are typically considered as whole numbers in practical terms, we round 459.74 to 460.

Thus, the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve is:

   \text{Weekly Consumption After} = 14 \text{ kWh/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 98 \text{ kWh/week}
   \]

5. **Calculate the Weekly Electric Bill Before Adding the Device**:
   - The cost per kilowatt hour is $1.50. Hence, her weekly bill before adding the device will be:
   \[
   \text{Bill Before} = 84 \text{ kWh} \times 1.50 \text{ dollars/kWh} = 126 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Calculate the Weekly Electric Bill After Adding the Device**:
   - Now, her weekly bill after adding the device will be:
   \[
   \text{Bill After} = 98 \text{ kWh} \times 1.50 \text{ dollars/kWh} = 147 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Calculate the Difference in Bills**:
   - Finally, we find the difference between the new bill and the old bill:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Bill After} - \text{Bill Before} = 147 \text{ dollars} - 126 \text{ dollars} = 21 \text{ dollars}
   \]

1. **Understanding the rate of work for one person**: 
   One person can paint half a house in 5 days. This means that to paint a whole house, it would take this one person double the time:
   \[
   \text{Time for one person to paint a whole house} = 5 \text{ days} \times 2 = 10 \text{ days}
   \]

2. **Calculating the work rate of one person**: 
   If one person can complete 1 house in 10 days, the rate of work for one person can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Rate of one person} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}}
   \]

3. **Calculating the combined rate of 5 people**: 
   If 5 people are working together, their combined rate of work would be:
   \[
   \text{Combined rate} = 5 \times \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{5 \text{ houses}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{2 \text{ days}}
   \]

4. **Determining how long it takes for 5 people to paint one house**: 
   Since 5 people can paint 1 house in 2 days, we need to convert this time into hours. Assuming there are 24 hours in a day:
   \[
   \text{Time in hours} = 2 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 48 \text{ hours}
   \]

Now, we have the final answer.

Therefore, the time it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house is:

1. **Identify what we know about Ophelia:**
   - Ophelia has 20 sofas.
   - She has 2 fewer sofas than chairs.

   Let \( C_o \) represent the number of chairs Ophelia has.
   Since she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can write the equation:
   \[
   C_o = 20 + 2 = 22
   \]
   So, Ophelia has 22 chairs.

2. **Identify what we know about Jenna:**
   - Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia.
   - Therefore, the number of chairs Jenna has, \( C_j \), can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   C_j = 3 \times C_o = 3 \times 22 = 66
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of sofas Jenna has:**
   - Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Let \( S_j \) represent the number of sofas Jenna has.
   - We can write the equation:
   \[
   S_j = C_j - 2 = 66 - 2 = 64
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:**
   - Total sofas \( = S_o + S_j = 20 + 64 = 84 \)
   - Total chairs \( = C_o + C_j = 22 + 66 = 88 \)

5. **Finally, calculate the total number of sofas and chairs combined:**
   \[

1. **Identify the costs**:
   - Tom bought a CD for $4.
   - Let’s denote the cost of the headphone set as \( H \).
   - The total amount Tom paid is $48.

2. **Set up the equation**:
   - The total amount spent can be represented as:
     \[
     4 + H = 48
     \]
   - To find \( H \), rearrange the equation:
     \[
     H = 48 - 4
     \]
   - Therefore, \( H = 44 \). This means the headphone set cost $44.

3. **Calculate how many CDs could be bought without the headphone set**:
   - If Tom had not bought the headphone set, he would have had the full $48 to spend on CDs.
   - The number of CDs he could buy with $48 is calculated by dividing the total amount by the cost of one CD:
     \[
     \text{Number of CDs} = \frac{48}{4} = 12
     \]

4. **Determine how many CDs he actually bought**:
   - With the headphone set, Tom spent $4 on the CD, so he bought 1 CD.

5. **Calculate the difference**:
   - The difference in the number of CDs he could have bought without the headphone set and the number he actually bought is:
     \[
     12 - 1 = 11
     \]

So, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

1. **Calculate the standard workout hours**:
   - Josh worked out for 4 hours each week for 6 weeks (since he had some weeks where he worked out differently).
   - Therefore, the total hours for these 6 weeks is:
     \[
     6 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 24 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Account for the weeks with different hours**:
   - For the two consecutive weeks where he spent 5 hours each week, the total for these 2 weeks is:
     \[
     2 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ hours/week} = 10 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Then, for the one week where he spent 6 hours, we simply add:

1. **Determine Jame's current age**:
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years. 
   - Therefore, his current age is:
     \[
     27 - 5 = 22 \text{ years old}
     \]

2. **Determine the age of Jame's cousin in 8 years**:
   - Let Jame's cousin's current age be \( x \).
   - In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be \( x + 8 \) years old.

3. **Set up the equation based on the cousin's age**:
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time.
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 22 + 8 = 30 \) years old.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
   - Therefore, Jame's cousin's age in 8 years can be expressed as:
     \[
     x + 8 = 60 - 5
     \]
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     x + 8 = 55
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - Subtract 8 from both sides:
     \[
     x = 55 - 8

1. **Identify the costs**: 
   - We know that the computer costs $1,100.
   - We also know that the printer cost $400 less than the computer.

2. **Calculate the cost of the printer**:
   - Cost of the printer = Cost of the computer - $400
   - Cost of the printer = $1,100 - $400 = $700

3. **Calculate the total cost of the computer, monitors, and printer**:
   - Total cost = cost of computer + cost of monitors + cost of printer
   - We can set up the equation: 
   - $2,400 = $1,100 + (2 * cost of one monitor) + $700

4. **Combine known costs**:
   - First, add the cost of the computer and printer:
   - $1,100 + $700 = $1,800

5. **Set up the equation for the monitors**:
   - Now substitute this into the total cost equation:
   - $2,400 = $1,800 + (2 * cost of one monitor)

6. **Isolate the term for the monitors**:
   - Subtract $1,800 from both sides:
   - $2,400 - $1,800 = 2 * cost of one monitor
   - $600 = 2 * cost of one monitor

7. **Solve for the cost of one monitor**:
   - Divide both sides by 2:
   - cost of one monitor = $600 / 2 = $300

Thus, the cost of one monitor is $300.

1. **Understanding the Group Division:**
   - There are 20 kids in total.
   - They are divided into two equal groups: boys and girls.
   - This means there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

2. **Calculating the Shells Brought by Boys:**
   - Each boy brought back 60 seashells.
   - Since there are 10 boys, the total number of shells brought back by the boys is:
     \[
     10 \text{ boys} \times 60 \text{ shells/boy} = 600 \text{ shells}
     \]

3. **Understanding the Girls' Contribution:**
   - According to the problem, the girls brought back an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.
   - The amount of shells brought by the girls can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{Number of shells by girls} = \text{Number of shells by boys} + 4 \times \text{Number of shells by boys}
     \]
   - This can be simplified:
     \[
     \text{Number of shells by girls} = 600 + 4 \times 600
     \]
   - Calculating further:
     \[
     4 \times 600 = 2400
     \]
   - Thus,
     \[
     \text{Number of shells by girls} = 600 + 2400 = 3000

4. **Calculating the Number of Shells per Girl:**
   - Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells brought back by each girl is:
     \[
     \text{Shells per girl} = \frac{\text{Total shells by girls}}{\text{Number of girls}} = \frac{3000}{10} = 300

   - April has 30 days.
   - The first half consists of the first 15 days (April 1 to April 15).
   - The second half consists of the last 15 days (April 16 to April 30).

2. **Define the daily savings for the first half**:
   - Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of the month. 
   - Therefore, in the first half of the month, he saves \( 15x \) (since there are 15 days).

3. **Define the daily savings for the second half**:
   - Elvis wants to save twice as much each day in the second half compared to the first half. So, in the second half, he will save \( 2x \) each day.
   - In the second half of the month, he saves \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

4. **Set up the equation for the total savings**:
   - The total savings for the month must equal his target of $1125:
     \[
     15x + 30x = 1125

1. **Understand the relationship between Jeff and Brad's amounts**: We know that Jeff gets 4 times as much money as Brad.

2. **Define variables**: 
   - Let the amount of money Brad gets be represented as \( B \).
   - Then, the amount of money Jeff gets will be \( 4B \) since Jeff gets 4 times what Brad gets.

3. **Set up the equation**: The total amount of money they are dividing is $100. So we can write the equation:
   \[
   B + 4B = 100
   \]

4. **Combine like terms**: This simplifies to:
   \[
   5B = 100
   \]

5. **Solve for \( B \)**: To find \( B \), divide both sides of the equation by 5:
   \[
   B = \frac{100}{5} = 20
   \]

6. **Calculate Jeff's amount**: Since Jeff gets 4 times what Brad gets:
   \[

gsm8k,gsm8k-562,SA,1,"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the initial angle**: The angle of the pyramid from the ground is 32 degrees. This means that if we draw a line from the ground to the tip of the pyramid, it makes an angle of 32 degrees with the horizontal ground.

2. **Sun's movement**: The sun is moving at a rate of 5 degrees per hour. This means that for every hour that passes, the angle between the ground and the position of the sun increases by 5 degrees.

3. **Total time of movement**: The sun is moving for 10 hours. Therefore, we need to calculate the total change in the angle of the sun's position over this time.

4. **Calculating the total increase in degrees**:
   - Increase in angle = Rate of movement × Time
   - Increase in angle = 5 degrees/hour × 10 hours = 50 degrees

5. **Final angle calculation**: Now we need to find the final angle of the sun relative to the ground after this increase.
   - Initial angle (pyramid's angle) = 32 degrees
   - Total increase in angle = 50 degrees
   - Final angle of the sun = Initial angle + Increase in angle
   - Final angle of the sun = 32 degrees + 50 degrees = 82 degrees

Thus, the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is 82 degrees.

1. **Determine the ages of the sons**:
   - One son is 12 years old.
   - The other son is 4 years younger than the first son.
   - Therefore, the age of the second son is \(12 - 4 = 8\) years old.

2. **Count the total number of candles needed**:
   - For the 12-year-old son, he will need 12 candles.
   - For the 8-year-old son, he will need 8 candles.
   - So, the total number of candles required is \(12 + 8 = 20\) candles.

3. **Calculate how many packs of candles James needs to buy**:
   - Each pack contains 5 candles.
   - To find out how many packs are needed for 20 candles, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack:
   \[
   \text{Number of packs} = \frac{20}{5} = 4 \text{ packs}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost**:
   - Each pack costs $3.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 4 packs is:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now we can summarize the calculations:

- Total candles needed: 20
- Number of packs needed: 4
- Total cost: $12

Thus, James spends a total of $12 on candles.

1. **Determine how many pages Judy read in the first week.**
   - Judy read for 15 minutes each night. 
   - Assuming she read every night for a week, she read for 7 nights.
   - Total reading time in the first week = 15 minutes/night × 7 nights = 105 minutes.
   - Now, we need to find out how many pages she read in those 105 minutes.
   - She reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, so we can find her reading rate:
     - Rate = 2 pages / 1.5 minutes = 4/3 pages per minute.
   - Now, calculate how many pages she read in 105 minutes:
     - Pages read = (4/3 pages/minute) × 105 minutes = 4 × 35 = 140 pages.

2. **Now, calculate the total pages she read in the second week.**
   - We know from the problem that in the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

3. **Add the pages read in both weeks to find the total.**
   - Total pages read = pages read in the first week + pages read in the second week.

   \]

2. **Pieces of Crayons**:
   Each crayon can be broken down into small pieces. However, the problem states that Kate uses 8 small pieces of crayons to make one muffin. To find out how many muffins she can make, we need to determine how many small pieces are available.

3. **Total Small Pieces Calculation**:
   The problem does not specify how many small pieces each crayon breaks into, but it implies that each crayon will provide enough small pieces to make muffins. For simplicity, we can assume that each crayon can be completely used to make muffins. 

   Since we don’t have a specific number of pieces per crayon and only know that 8 pieces are needed for one muffin, we will calculate how many muffins Kate can make based on the total number of crayons.

4. **Muffins Calculation**: 
   Since each muffin requires 8 pieces, we can calculate the number of muffins Kate can make from 192 crayons (assuming each crayon can yield enough pieces).

   To find out how many muffins she can make, we need to divide the total number of crayons by the number of pieces needed for one muffin:

2. His brother has 3 fewer cards than the boy. To find out how many cards the brother has, we subtract 3 from the number of cards the boy has:
   - Number of cards the brother has = 5 (the boy's cards) - 3 = 2 cards.
3. Now, to find the total number of cards they have together, we add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards his brother has:
   - Total cards = 5 (boy's cards) + 2 (brother's cards) = 7 cards.

gsm8k,gsm8k-580,SA,1,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the percentage error**: 
   - Maggie's oven reads 450 degrees, but the actual temperature is 468 degrees.
   - To find the error, we first calculate the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature:
     \[
     \text{Error} = 468 - 450 = 18 \text{ degrees}
     \]
   - Next, we calculate the percentage error based on the set temperature (450 degrees):
     \[
     \text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{\text{Error}}{\text{Set Temperature}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - Performing the division:
     \[
     \frac{18}{450} = 0.04
     \]
   - Now, converting to percentage:
     \[
     0.04 \times 100 = 4\%
     \]

2. **Apply the same percentage error to the new temperature**:
   - The recipe calls for a temperature of 520 degrees. Since the oven runs hot by 4%, we need to find out what set temperature will yield an actual temperature of 520 degrees.
   - Let \( x \) be the temperature Maggie should set on her oven. The actual temperature would then be:
     \[
     \text{Actual Temperature} = x + 0.04x = 1.04x
     \]
   - We want this actual temperature to equal 520 degrees:
     \[
     1.04x = 520
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 1.04:
     \[
     x = \frac{520}{1.04}
     \]
   - Performing the division:
     \[
     x = 500
     \]

Finally, we conclude that Maggie should set her oven to:

1. **Determine the number of contacts Pete will have**:
   - Each box contains 90 single-use contacts.
   - If Pete buys 2 boxes, he will have:
     \[
     90 \text{ contacts/box} \times 2 \text{ boxes} = 180 \text{ contacts}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the boxes**:
   - The cost of one box is $100.00.
   - With a 10% discount on the box, the discount on one box is:
     \[
     10\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.10 \times 100 = 10
     \]
   - Thus, the discounted price of one box is:
     \[
     100 - 10 = 90 \text{ dollars}

   - Total hours worked by Jill = 2 hours (Saturday) + 1 hour (Sunday) = 3 hours.
   - Jill's total earnings = Total hours worked × Pay rate = 3 hours × $10/hour = $30.

2. **Calculate John's Hours:**
   - John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday.
     - Since Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday, John worked = 2 × 2 hours = 4 hours.
   - John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday.
     - Since Jill worked 1 hour on Sunday, John worked = 3 × 1 hour = 3 hours.

   - For aerobics: 
     - She spends 2 hours doing aerobics.
     - The rate of calorie burn for aerobics is 500 calories/hour.
     - Total calories burned from aerobics = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

   - For running:
     - She spends 1 hour running.
     - The rate of calorie burn for running is 600 calories/hour.
     - Total calories burned from running = 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

2. Now, we need to find the total calories burned from both activities:
   - Total calories burned = calories burned from aerobics + calories burned from running
   - Total calories burned = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories.

3. Next, we calculate how much water Hannah needs to drink based on the total calories burned:
   - Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned.
   - To find out how many 200 calorie segments are in 1600 calories, we divide:
     - Number of 200 calorie segments = 1600 calories / 200 calories = 8 segments.

4. Finally, since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for each 200 calorie segment:
   - Total water needed = 8 segments * 100 ml/segment = 800 ml.

Putting it all together, the amount of water Hannah needs to drink is 800 ml.

According to the note:
- The number of red jelly beans \( r \) is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans. This can be expressed as:
  \[
  r = b - 0.01b = 0.99b
  \]
  
- The number of green jelly beans \( g \) is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans. This can be expressed as:
  \[
  g = b + 0.01b = 1.01b
  \]

Now, we can express the total number of jelly beans in terms of \( b \):
\[
r + b + g = 4500
\]
Substituting the expressions for \( r \) and \( g \):
\[
0.99b + b + 1.01b = 4500
\]

Combining the terms:
\[
(0.99b + 1b + 1.01b) = 4500
\]
\[
(0.99 + 1 + 1.01)b = 4500
\]
\[
3.01b = 4500
\]

Now, we can solve for \( b \):
\[
b = \frac{4500}{3.01}
\]
Calculating \( b \):
\[
b \approx 1498.34
\]

Now, we will calculate \( r \) and \( g \):
1. For red jelly beans \( r \):
   \[
   r = 0.99b \approx 0.99 \times 1498.34 \approx 1483.84
   \]
   Rounding gives \( r = 1484 \) (since we cannot have a fraction of a jelly bean).

2. For green jelly beans \( g \):
   \[
   g = 1.01b \approx 1.01 \times 1498.34 \approx 1516.66
   \]
   Rounding gives \( g = 1517 \).

Next, we need to verify that the total number of jelly beans adds up to 4500:
\[
r + b + g = 1484 + 1498 + 1517 = 4500
\]
This confirms that our calculations are correct.

Finally, we need to find out how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans:
\[
g - r = 1517 - 1484 = 33

gsm8k,gsm8k-596,SA,1,"To determine how many hours George needs to work to pay for his dental work, let's break down the costs and calculations step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the dental work**:
   - Cost of 2 implants: Each implant costs $2000, so for 2 implants:
     \[
     2 \times 2000 = 4000
     \]
   - Additional cost for the porcelain crown on one implant: $500.
   - Total cost of the dental work:
     \[
     4000 + 500 = 4500
     \]

2. **Subtract the deposit**:
   - George has already put down a deposit of $600. We need to subtract this from the total cost to find out how much he still needs to pay.
   - Remaining amount to be paid:
     \[
     4500 - 600 = 3900
     \]

3. **Calculate how many hours George needs to work**:
   - George makes $15 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we will divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage.
   - Hours needed to work:
     \[
     \frac{3900}{15} = 260
     \]

Therefore, George needs to work **260 hours** to have enough money to pay for the dental work.

According to the problem:
- One angle is twice the smallest angle, which we can denote as \( 2x \).
- Another angle is three times the smallest angle, which we can denote as \( 3x \).

Now, we have three angles in the triangle:
1. Smallest angle: \( x \)
2. Second angle: \( 2x \)
3. Largest angle: \( 3x \)

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
x + 2x + 3x = 180
\]

Now, combine the terms on the left side:

\[
6x = 180
\]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 6:

\[
x = \frac{180}{6} = 30
\]

Now that we have the smallest angle, we can find the measures of the other two angles:
- The second angle is \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees.
- The largest angle is \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees.

### Step 1: Calculate earnings for the first 4 hours
- **Cups sold per hour**: 15 cups
- **Price per cup**: $0.50
- **Total hours**: 4 hours

First, calculate the total number of cups sold in the first 4 hours:
\[
\text{Total cups sold} = \text{Cups per hour} \times \text{Total hours} = 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ cups}
\]

1. **Understanding the information given**:
   - The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00.
   - 2 pumps of shampoo are used for 120 washings.
   - Jackie uses 1 pump per wash.

2. **Finding out how many washings Jackie can get with 1 pump**:
   Since 2 pumps provide 120 washings, we can find out how many washings 1 pump provides:

   \[
   \text{Washings per pump} = \frac{120 \text{ washings}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washings per pump}
   \]

3. **Calculating the total number of pumps Jackie will use for her washings**:
   If Jackie uses 1 pump for each washing, and she can get 60 washings from 1 pump, it means she will need 60 pumps for 60 washings.

4. **Finding the cost of each pump**:
   We need to determine the cost of each pump. First, we need to find out how many pumps are in the entire bottle.

   Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, we can calculate the total number of pumps in the shampoo bottle:

   \[
   \text{Total pumps in the bottle} = 2 \text{ pumps} \times 1 \text{ (for the 120 washings)}
   \]

   Now, since 1 pump is used per washing for 120 washings, it means the bottle provides:

   \[
   \text{Total pumps} = 120 \text{ washings}
   \]

5. **Calculating the cost of each pump**:
   To find the cost per pump, we will take the total cost of the bottle and divide it by the total number of pumps:

   \[
   \text{Cost per pump} = \frac{24.00}{120}
   \]

   Performing the division gives:

   \[
   \text{Cost per pump} = 0.20 \text{ dollars}

1. **Initial Funding and Duration**:  
   - John receives initial funding of $100,000 for the first 5 months.  
   - Therefore, the cost for these 5 months is simply $100,000.

2. **Total Duration of Research**:  
   - The research ends up taking 10 times longer than the initial 5 months.  
   - Thus, the total duration of the research is:  
     \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \) months.

3. **Funding After Initial Period**:  
   - The research continues for an additional \( 50 - 5 = 45 \) months after the initial funding period.
   - The funding for each of these months increases by 50% compared to the previous month.

4. **Funding Calculation**:  
   - The initial funding for the 6th month (after the first 5 months) will be 50% more than the average monthly funding from the first 5 months.  
   - Since the total initial funding for the first 5 months is $100,000, the average monthly funding for these 5 months is:  
     \( \text{Average monthly funding} = \frac{100,000}{5} = 20,000 \).

5. **Funding for Each Month After the First 5**:  
   - The funding for the 6th month will be:  
     \( 20,000 + (0.5 \times 20,000) = 20,000 + 10,000 = 30,000 \).  
   - This pattern continues, where each subsequent month receives 50% more than the previous month.  
   - This creates a geometric series for the funding from months 6 to 50.

6. **Funding for Each Month (6th to 50th)**:  
   - The funding for month \( n \) (where \( n \) starts from 1 for month 6) can be expressed as:  
     \( F_n = 20,000 \times (1.5)^{(n-1)} \).
   - The total funding from month 6 to month 50 (45 months) can be calculated using the formula for the sum of a geometric series:  
     \( S_n = a \frac{(r^n - 1)}{r - 1} \),  
     where \( a \) is the first term, \( r \) is the common ratio, and \( n \) is the number of terms.

7. **Parameters for the Series**:  
   - First term \( a = 30,000 \) (funding for the 6th month).  
   - Common ratio \( r = 1.5 \).  
   - Number of terms \( n = 45 \).  

8. **Calculating the Total Funding from Months 6 to 50**:  
   - Plugging into the formula:  
     \( S_{45} = 30,000 \frac{(1.5^{45} - 1)}{1.5 - 1} = 30,000 \frac{(1.5^{45} - 1)}{0.5} = 60,000 (1.5^{45} - 1) \).

9. **Calculating \( 1.5^{45} \)**:  
   - \( 1.5^{45} \) is a large number, so let’s approximate it:  
     \( 1.5^{45} \approx 275,568. | \text{(using a calculator)} \)

10. **Plugging in the Values**:  
    - \( S_{45} = 60,000 (275,568 - 1) \)  
    - \( S_{45} = 60,000 \times 275,567 = 16,534,020,000 \).

11. **Total Cost of Research**:  
    - The total cost of research is the initial funding plus the funding from months 6 to 50:  
      \( \text{Total cost} = 100,000 + 16,534,020,000 = 16,534,120,000 \).

Thus, the total cost of John's research is:

1. **Calculate the total revenue from car sales**:
   James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each. 
   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000
   \]

2. **Determine the total cost of acquiring the cars**:
   The company paid 30% of the selling price to acquire the cars.
   \[
   \text{Cost per car} = 30\% \text{ of } 25,000 = 0.30 \times 25,000 = 7,500
   \]
   Therefore, the total cost for 10 cars is:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the profit**:
   Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost.
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000
   \]

4. **Determine James's commission**:
   James earns a 10% commission on the profit.
   \[
   \text{Commission} = 10\% \text{ of Profit} = 0.10 \times 175,000 = 17,500

1. **Identify the prices:**
   We know the price of a diamond jewel is given as $2000.

2. **Calculate the price of the gold jewel:**
   The price of a gold jewel is \( \frac{4}{5} \) times the price of a diamond jewel.
   \[
   \text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000
   \]
   Performing the multiplication:
   \[
   = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
   \]
   So, the price of the gold jewel is $1600.

3. **Calculate the price of the silver jewel:**
   The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel.
   \[
   \text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
   \]
   So, the price of the silver jewel is $1200.

4. **Calculate the total price of all three jewels:**
   Now we add the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels together:
   \[
   \text{Total price} = \text{Price of diamond} + \text{Price of gold} + \text{Price of silver}
   \]
   \[

1. **Understanding the total cost and cost per class**:
   - Manny signed up for Karate classes for a total of $60.
   - There are 10 total classes.
   - The parents have a condition that if the cost per class exceeds $10, they won't sign him up again.

2. **Calculating the cost per class if he attends all classes**:
   - The cost per class if Manny attends all classes is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Cost per class} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Total classes}} = \frac{60}{10} = 6
     \]
   - If Manny attends all 10 classes, it costs $6 per class, which is under the $10 limit.

3. **Determining the cost if he misses classes**:
   - Let's denote the number of classes Manny misses as \( x \).
   - The number of classes he attends would then be \( 10 - x \).
   - The new cost per class if he misses \( x \) classes is:
     \[
     \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x}
     \]
   - We need this cost per class to be less than or equal to $10:
     \[
     \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10
     \]

4. **Solving the inequality**:
   - We can solve the inequality step-by-step:
     \[
     60 \leq 10 \times (10 - x)
     \]
     \[
     60 \leq 100 - 10x
     \]
     \[
     10x \leq 100 - 60
     \]
     \[
     10x \leq 40
     \]
     \[
     x \leq 4
     \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10. If he misses more than 4 classes, the cost per class will be more than $10, and his parents won't sign him up again.

1. **Identify the distances each person ran**:
   - We know that Paisley ran 4 miles.
   - Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran. So, we calculate Reggie's distance:
     \[
     \text{Reggie's distance} = 5 \times \text{Paisley's distance} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ miles}
     \]

2. **Determine the relationship between Reggie and Lynn's distances**:
   - We are given that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. We can express this as:
     \[
     \text{Reggie's distance} = \text{Lynn's distance} + 3
     \]

3. **Substituting Reggie's distance to find Lynn's distance**:
   - We already calculated that Reggie ran 20 miles. Thus, we can substitute this value into the equation:
     \[
     20 = \text{Lynn's distance} + 3
     \]

4. **Solve for Lynn's distance**:
   - To find Lynn's distance, we will subtract 3 from both sides:
     \[
     \text{Lynn's distance} = 20 - 3 = 17 \text{ miles}

   \text{Steve's wife's age} = 60 + 4 = 64 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Son's Age**: Their son is currently half as old as his mom. Therefore:
   \[
   \text{Son's age} = \frac{64}{2} = 32 \text{ years old}
   \]

4. **Son's Wife's Age**: The son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband. So:
   \[
   \text{Son's wife's age} = 32 - 3 = 29 \text{ years old}
   \]

Now that we have calculated the ages, we find that Steve's son's wife is 29 years old.

1. Start by determining the total amount of flour in one bag. According to the problem, a bag of flour is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each. 
   - Therefore, the total amount of flour in one bag can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Total flour in one bag} = \text{Number of portions} \times \text{Weight of each portion}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total flour in one bag} = 8 \text{ portions} \times 2 \text{ kg/portion} = 16 \text{ kg}
     \]

2. Now that we know there are 16 kilograms of flour in one bag, we can find out how much flour is in three bags:
   - To find the total flour in three bags, we multiply the amount of flour in one bag by 3:
     \[
     \text{Total flour in three bags} = 3 \times \text{Total flour in one bag}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total flour in three bags} = 3 \times 16 \text{ kg} = 48 \text{ kg}
     \]

3. Therefore, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is:
   \[
   48 \text{ kg}
   \]

1. **Calculate Alisa's distance:**
   - Alisa's speed = 12 miles per hour.
   - Alisa's time = 4.5 hours.
   - Distance = Speed × Time.
   - Distance Alisa biked = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours.

   Let's perform the arithmetic:
   - 12 × 4.5 = 54 miles.

2. **Calculate Stanley's distance:**
   - Stanley's speed = 10 miles per hour.
   - Stanley's time = 2.5 hours.
   - Distance = Speed × Time.
   - Distance Stanley biked = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours.

   Let's perform the arithmetic:
   - 10 × 2.5 = 25 miles.

3. **Add the distances together to find the total distance:**
   - Total distance = Distance Alisa biked + Distance Stanley biked.
   - Total distance = 54 miles + 25 miles.

1. **Calculate the time to dig through the soil:**
   - Bill digs through soil at a rate of 4 feet per hour.
   - He has to dig through 24 feet of soil.
   - The time taken to dig through soil can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Rate}}
     \]
   - Plugging in the values:
     \[
     \text{Time for soil} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}

1. **Identify Sales from Red Hats**:
   - Ariadne earned $400 from selling red hats.

2. **Determine Sales from Green Hats**:
   - It is stated that the sales from red hats were half the total amount earned from selling green hats. 
   - Let the sales from green hats be represented as \( G \).
   - Since the sales from red hats are half of the green hats sales, we have:
     \[
     400 = \frac{1}{2} G
     \]
   - To find \( G \), we multiply both sides by 2:
     \[
     G = 400 \times 2 = 800
     \]

3. **Calculate Total Sales for the First Month**:
   - The total sales for the first month, \( T \), is the sum of sales from red and green hats:
     \[
     T = \text{Sales from red hats} + \text{Sales from green hats} = 400 + 800 = 1200
     \]

4. **Determine Sales for the Second Month**:
   - It is stated that in the second month, her sales were \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total sales of the first month.
   - Therefore, the total sales for the second month \( S_2 \) can be calculated as:
     \[
     S_2 = \frac{3}{4} T = \frac{3}{4} \times 1200
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:

2. **Identifying the free hour**: James gets 1 hour free. Therefore, we need to subtract this free hour from the total time he hired the carriage. 

   Total hours hired = 4 hours  
   Free hour = 1 hour  
   Paid hours = Total hours hired - Free hour = 4 - 1 = 3 hours

3. **Calculating the cost**: 
   - The first paid hour costs $15.
   - Each hour after the first paid hour costs twice the cost of the first hour. Therefore, the second hour will cost $30 (which is 2 times $15) and the third hour will also cost $30.

4. **Calculating the total cost**: 
   - First hour cost: $15
   - Second hour cost: $30
   - Third hour cost: $30

   Now, let's sum these costs:
   Total cost = First hour + Second hour + Third hour  
   Total cost = $15 + $30 + $30  
   Total cost = $15 + $60  
   Total cost = $75

   - Therefore, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is:
     \[
     \text{Total deviled egg halves} = \text{Number of guests} \times \text{Halves per guest} = 16 \times 3 = 48
     \]

2. **Calculate how many whole eggs are needed**:
   - Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves.
   - To find out how many whole eggs are needed to make 48 deviled egg halves, we can set up the equation based on the number of halves produced by each egg.
   - Since 1 egg makes 2 halves, we can find the number of eggs needed by dividing the total halves by 2:

   - He plans to read 10 pages each day.
   - We need to determine how many days it will take for Mike to finish reading the book and then see how many days he has left before the 30-day deadline.

2. **Perform the arithmetic carefully**:
   - First, calculate the number of days it will take for Mike to read the entire book:
     - Total pages = 200 pages
     - Pages per day = 10 pages
     - Days to finish reading = Total pages / Pages per day = 200 pages / 10 pages per day = 20 days.
   
   - Now, we know that Mike will finish reading in 20 days. The total time allowed is 30 days.
   - To find out how many days before the deadline he finishes, we subtract the days it takes him to finish from the total days allowed:
     - Days before the deadline = Total days - Days to finish = 30 days - 20 days = 10 days.

     2 \times 5,000 \text{ dollars} = 10,000 \text{ dollars/month on fuel}
     \]
   - For one year (12 months), the total cost for fuel is:

1. **Calculate the cost for the first mixture:**
   - We have 1/2 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts.
   - The cost of almonds is $10 per pound, so:
     \[
     \text{Cost of } \frac{1}{2} \text{ pound almonds} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \text{ dollars}

     \text{Cost of } \frac{1}{3} \text{ pound walnuts} = \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total cost for the first mixture is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 5 + 5 = 10 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost for the second mixture:**
   - We have 1/5 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts.
   - The cost of almonds is still $10 per pound, so:
     \[
     \text{Cost of } \frac{1}{5} \text{ pound almonds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The cost of walnuts remains $15 per pound, so:
     \[
     \text{Cost of } \frac{1}{3} \text{ pound walnuts} = \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total cost for the second mixture is:

gsm8k,gsm8k-660,SA,1,"To solve the problem, we will use two variables to represent the number of sheep and geese on Lee's farm.

Let's define:
- \( S \) = number of sheep
- \( G \) = number of geese

### Step 1: Set up the equations

1. Each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs. The total number of legs is 70. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   4S + 2G = 70
   \]

2. Each animal has 1 head. The total number of heads is 20. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   S + G = 20
   \]

### Step 2: Simplify the equations

From the second equation, we can express \( G \) in terms of \( S \):
\[
G = 20 - S
\]

### Step 3: Substitute into the first equation

Now we will substitute \( G \) in the first equation:
\[
4S + 2(20 - S) = 70
\]

### Step 4: Simplify and solve for \( S \)

Expanding the equation gives:
\[
4S + 40 - 2S = 70
\]

Combining like terms:
\[
2S + 40 = 70
\]

Now, subtract 40 from both sides:
\[
2S = 30
\]

Dividing both sides by 2 gives:
\[
S = 15
\]

### Step 5: Find \( G \)

Now that we know \( S \), we can find \( G \):
\[
G = 20 - S = 20 - 15 = 5
\]

### Conclusion

Lee has 15 sheep on his farm.

   - The more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand.
   - To find 20% of $5: 
     \[
     20\% \text{ of } 5 = 0.20 \times 5 = 1
     \]
   - Therefore, the cost of the more expensive coffee is:
     \[
     5 + 1 = 6
     \]

3. **Daily coffee consumption**: Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day. For a week (7 days):
   \[
   \text{Total coffee needed} = 7 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Total cost of the coffee**:
   - The cost of 7 pounds of the more expensive coffee:
     \[
     7 \text{ pounds} \times 6 \text{ dollars/pound} = 42 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Cost of the donut**: Roger buys a donut for $2.

6. **Total cost**: Now, we add the total cost of the coffee and the cost of the donut:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 42 \text{ dollars} + 2 \text{ dollars} = 44 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **List the items purchased and their costs**:
   - 2 bags of chips at $2.00 each: 
     - Total cost for chips = 2 bags * $2.00/bag = $4.00
   - A bucket of fried chicken for $8.00: 
     - Total cost for chicken = $8.00
   - A bottle of soda for $1.00: 
     - Total cost for soda = $1.00

3. **Calculate the total cost of the items purchased**:
   - Total cost = Cost of chips + Cost of chicken + Cost of soda
   - Total cost = $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00

4. **Perform the arithmetic**:
   - First, add the cost of chips and chicken: 
     - $4.00 + $8.00 = $12.00
   - Then, add the cost of soda:
     - $12.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

5. **Determine how much was spent on the apple pie**:
   - The total amount spent by Gus is $20.00.
   - The total cost of the items he purchased (chips, chicken, and soda) is $13.00.

1. **Total Newspapers Delivered**: James delivers a total of 600 newspapers in a day.

2. **Newspapers Delivered to Each District**:
   - District A: 198 newspapers
   - District C: 209 newspapers
   - Let \( x \) be the number of newspapers delivered to District B.

3. **Set Up the Equation**:
   To find the number of newspapers delivered to District B, we can set up the equation based on the total number of newspapers:
   \[
   \text{Total newspapers} = \text{Newspapers to District A} + \text{Newspapers to District B} + \text{Newspapers to District C}
   \]
   Substituting the known values into the equation:
   \[
   600 = 198 + x + 209
   \]

4. **Combine the Known Values**:
   First, we will add the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C:
   \[
   198 + 209 = 407
   \]

5. **Substitute Back into the Equation**:
   Now, we can substitute this sum back into the equation:
   \[
   600 = 407 + x
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   To find \( x \), we will subtract 407 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 600 - 407
   \]
   Performing the subtraction:
   \[
   x = 193

   \text{Karen's daily earnings} = \text{Karen's hourly wage} \times \text{hours worked per day} = 20 \times 3 = 60
   \]
   Thus, Karen earns $60 per day.

4. **Calculate Karen's earnings over two days**:
   Since Karen works for two days, we calculate her total earnings:
   \[
   \text{Karen's earnings for two days} = \text{Karen's daily earnings} \times 2 = 60 \times 2 = 120

1. **Determine the total weight of the adults:**
   - There are 9 adults in total (Jack and 8 others).
   - Each adult weighs an average of 80 kg.
   - To find the total weight, we multiply the number of adults by the average weight of each:
     \[
     \text{Total weight} = 9 \times 80 \text{ kg}
     \]

2. **Perform the multiplication:**
   - Calculating the total weight:
     \[
     9 \times 80 = 720 \text{ kg}
     \]

gsm8k,gsm8k-681,SA,1,"Let's break down the information given in the problem step by step.

1. **Katarina's Cookies**: We know that Katarina has 68 cookies.

2. **Katarina and Max**: The problem states that Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   K = M - 5
   \]
   where \( K \) is the number of cookies Katarina has and \( M \) is the number of cookies Max has. Substituting \( K = 68 \):
   \[
   68 = M - 5
   \]
   To find \( M \), we add 5 to both sides:
   \[
   M = 68 + 5 = 73
   \]
   So, Max has 73 cookies.

3. **Max and the Cookie Monster**: Next, we know that Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. We can express this as:
   \[
   M = C + 12
   \]
   where \( C \) is the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has. Substituting \( M = 73 \):
   \[
   73 = C + 12
   \]
   To find \( C \), we subtract 12 from both sides:
   \[
   C = 73 - 12 = 61
   \]
   So, the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies.

4. **Summer's Cookies**: Finally, we know that Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. We can express this as:
   \[
   S = M + 23
   \]
   where \( S \) is the number of cookies Summer has. Substituting \( M = 73 \):
   \[
   S = 73 + 23 = 96
   \]
   So, Summer has 96 cookies.

5. **Total Cookies**: Now we can find the total number of cookies they all have:
   \[
   \text{Total} = K + M + C + S
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Total} = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96
   \]

   We perform the arithmetic:
   \[
   68 + 73 = 141
   \]
   \[
   141 + 61 = 202
   \]
   \[
   202 + 96 = 298

gsm8k,gsm8k-682,SA,1,"To find the original length of the dress, let's break the problem down step by step.

1. **Understanding the final design**: We know that the final length of the dress is 140 cm. This includes the original length of the dress plus an extension of 50% of the original length and an additional 20 cm for the lace trim.

2. **Setting up the equation**:
   - Let the original length of the dress be denoted as \( x \).
   - The dress is extended by 50% of its original length, which is \( 0.5x \).
   - Therefore, the total length of the dress before adding the lace trim is:
     \[
     x + 0.5x = 1.5x
     \]
   - After adding the lace trim of 20 cm, the equation for the final length becomes:
     \[
     1.5x + 20 = 140
     \]

3. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   - We can now solve the equation:
     \[
     1.5x + 20 = 140
     \]
   - Subtract 20 from both sides:
     \[
     1.5x = 140 - 20
     \]
     \[
     1.5x = 120
     \]
   - Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to isolate \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{120}{1.5}
     \]
   - Calculating \( \frac{120}{1.5} \):
     \[
     x = 80

gsm8k,gsm8k-683,SA,1,"To find out how long it took Chris to mow the lawn by using both speeds, we can break the problem down step-by-step.

1. **Determine the rates of the mower in each mode**:
   - In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, his rate in turtle mode is:
     \[
     \text{Rate in turtle mode} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{60} \text{ lawns per minute}
     \]

   - In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. Therefore, his rate in rabbit mode is:
     \[
     \text{Rate in rabbit mode} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{40} \text{ lawns per minute}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time spent mowing half the lawn in each mode**:
   - Half of the lawn is \( \frac{1}{2} \) lawn. We will calculate the time taken to mow half the lawn in each mode.

   - **In turtle mode**:
     \[
     \text{Time in turtle mode} = \text{Amount of lawn} \div \text{Rate in turtle mode} = \frac{1/2}{1/60} = \frac{1/2 \times 60}{1} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

   - **In rabbit mode**:
     \[
     \text{Time in rabbit mode} = \text{Amount of lawn} \div \text{Rate in rabbit mode} = \frac{1/2}{1/40} = \frac{1/2 \times 40}{1} = 20 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total time spent mowing the lawn**:
   - Now we add the time spent in turtle mode and rabbit mode:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = \text{Time in turtle mode} + \text{Time in rabbit mode} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}

1. **Define the variables**:
   - Let the age of one twin be \( T \).
   - Let the age of one triplet be \( R \).
   - Since there are twins, we have another twin who is also \( T \).
   - There are three triplets, so we have ages \( R, R, R \).

2. **Translate the problem into equations**:
   - We know that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet:  
     \[ T = R + 7 \]
   - We also know that their combined ages are 44. The combined ages include both twins and all triplets:
     \[ 2T + 3R = 44 \]

3. **Substitute \( T \) in the second equation**:
   - Substitute \( T \) from the first equation into the second equation:
     \[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

4. **Expand and simplify the equation**:

   - Manolo bought 5 lollipops, and each lollipop costs $0.40.
   - Total cost for lollipops = Number of lollipops × Cost per lollipop
   - Total cost for lollipops = 5 × $0.40 = $2.00

2. **Determine the total cost of the candies**:
   - We know the total cost of 5 lollipops and 4 candies is $3.20.
   - We have already calculated the cost of the lollipops as $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost of the 4 candies can be found by subtracting the cost of the lollipops from the total cost.

   - Rong saves 20 coins every month.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Over 10 years, the total number of months is:
     \[
     10 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 120 \text{ months}

   - Therefore, the total number of coins Rong saves in 10 years is:
     \[
     20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins}
     \]

2. **Calculate Neil's savings**:
   - Neil saves \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more coins than Rong each month. 
   - First, calculate how many coins that is. Since Rong saves 20 coins, we find \( \frac{2}{5} \) of 20:
     \[
     \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \text{ coins}

2. **Let the total bill be represented by 'T'.** 
   - We know that the heartworm check costs 60% of the total bill. This means:
     - Cost of heartworm check = 0.6 * T.

3. **Set up the equation:**
   - The total bill consists of the cost of the vaccines plus the cost of the heartworm check:
     - T = Cost of vaccines + Cost of heartworm check
     - T = $40 + 0.6 * T.

4. **Rearrange the equation to solve for T:**
   - Move 0.6 * T to the left side:
     - T - 0.6 * T = $40

1. **Convert Topher's Shoe Length to Inches**:  
   Topher's shoe length is given as 8 feet and 4 inches.  
   - There are 12 inches in a foot, so first we convert 8 feet to inches:  
     \(8 \text{ feet} = 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ inches}\)  
   - Now add the 4 inches:  
     \(96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches}\)  
   So, Topher's shoe length is 100 inches.

2. **Set Up the Equation**:  
   According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes (T) is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby’s shoes (B). We can express this relationship mathematically:  
   \[
   T = 9B + 10
   \]  
   We know that \(T = 100\) inches, so we can substitute that into the equation:  
   \[
   100 = 9B + 10
   \]

3. **Solve for B**:  
   We need to isolate \(B\). First, subtract 10 from both sides:  
   \[
   100 - 10 = 9B  
   \]  
   \[
   90 = 9B  
   \]  
   Now, divide both sides by 9:  
   \[
   B = \frac{90}{9}

   \[
   B = 10

2. **Calculate Dora's father's age**: 
   - According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age.
   - First, we calculate twice Dora's age: 
     \( 2 \times 15 = 30 \).
   - Now, we add 8 to this result to find the father's age:
     \( 30 + 8 = 38 \).
   - So, Dora's father is 38 years old.

3. **Calculate Dora's mother's age**: 
   - The problem states that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father.
   - To find the mother's age, we subtract 4 from the father's age:
     \( 38 - 4 = 34 \).

   We are given that Clara has 20 books.

2. **Relate Clara's books to Steven's books**: 
   The problem states that Clara has twice as many books as Steven. Therefore, if we let the number of books Steven has be represented by \( S \), we can express Clara's books as:
   \[
   C = 2S
   \]
   Given that Clara has 20 books, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   2S = 20
   \]

3. **Solve for Steven's books**: 
   To find the number of books Steven has, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
   \[
   S = \frac{20}{2} = 10
   \]

4. **Relate Alice's books to Steven's books**: 
   The problem also states that Alice has 6 more books than Steven. Therefore, we can express Alice's books as:
   \[
   A = S + 6

   According to the problem, Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. 
   So, if Sean has 56 marbles, we can find Cal's marbles by:
   \[
   \text{Cal's marbles} = 2 \times \text{Sean's marbles} = 2 \times 56 = 112
   \]
   Thus, Cal has 112 marbles.

3. **Find out how many marbles Carl has**:
   The problem states that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. 
   Therefore, we calculate Carl's marbles as follows:
   \[
   \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times \text{Sean's marbles} = 4 \times 56 = 224
   \]
   So, Carl has 224 marbles.

4. **Calculate the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined**:
   Now we need to add the number of marbles Carl and Cal have together:
   \[
   \text{Total marbles} = \text{Carl's marbles} + \text{Cal's marbles} = 224 + 112 = 336
   \]

Finally, the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined is:

1. **Determine Group Size**: We start with 54 students who need to be divided into groups. If we want to form 6 groups, we can find the size of each group by dividing the total number of students by the number of groups:
   \[
   \text{Group size} = \frac{54 \text{ students}}{6 \text{ groups}} = 9 \text{ students per group}
   \]

2. **Identify Required Groups**: The problem states that the activity requires 12 groups. 

3. **Calculate Total Students Needed for 12 Groups**: Next, we calculate how many students are needed to fill 12 groups with the same group size of 9 students:
   \[
   \text{Total students for 12 groups} = 12 \text{ groups} \times 9 \text{ students per group} = 108 \text{ students}
   \]

4. **Find the Difference**: Now, we need to determine how many more groups we need to accommodate all 108 students, given we currently only have 54 students:
   \[
   \text{Extra students needed} = 108 \text{ students} - 54 \text{ students} = 54 \text{ students}
   \]

5. **Calculate Additional Groups Needed**: Since each group consists of 9 students, we can find out how many additional groups are needed for the extra 54 students:
   \[
   \text{Additional groups needed} = \frac{54 \text{ students}}{9 \text{ students per group}} = 6 \text{ groups}
   \]

6. **Final Count**: We already have 6 groups, and to reach the required 12 groups, we need:
   \[
   \text{Total groups needed} = 12 \text{ groups} - 6 \text{ groups} = 6 \text{ more groups}

1. **Determine the number of weeks**:
   - Two 4-week months equal 8 weeks.

2. **Calculate the number of weekdays and weekends**:
   - Each week has 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days.
   - Therefore, in 8 weeks:
     - Weekdays = 5 weekdays/week * 8 weeks = 40 weekdays
     - Weekends = 2 weekend days/week * 8 weeks = 16 weekend days

3. **Calculate the total number of chairs rented on weekdays**:
   - Candy rents out 60 chairs each weekday.
   - Total chairs rented on weekdays = 60 chairs/day * 40 weekdays = 2400 chairs.

4. **Calculate the total number of chairs rented on weekends**:
   - Candy rents out 100 chairs each weekend day.
   - Total chairs rented on weekends = 100 chairs/day * 16 weekend days = 1600 chairs.

5. **Calculate the total chairs rented in two 4-week months**:
   - Total chairs rented = Total chairs rented on weekdays + Total chairs rented on weekends
   - Total chairs rented = 2400 chairs + 1600 chairs = 4000 chairs.

1. **Identify the monthly electricity bill**: The total electricity bill each month is $100.

2. **Determine the number of roommates**: Jenna has 4 roommates, which means there are a total of 5 people (Jenna + 4 roommates).

3. **Calculate the monthly share per person**: To find out how much each person pays, we divide the total bill by the number of people:
   \[
   \text{Monthly share per person} = \frac{\text{Total monthly bill}}{\text{Number of people}} = \frac{100}{5} = 20
   \]
   So each person pays $20 per month.

4. **Calculate the yearly payment for each person**: Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly share by 12 to get the yearly payment:
   \[
   \text{Yearly payment per person} = \text{Monthly share per person} \times 12 = 20 \times 12 = 240

1. **Initial Stickers and Buttons**:
   - Lorraine starts with:
     - 30 small stickers
     - 40 large stickers

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons**:
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so 27 small stickers can be traded for 27 small buttons.
   - Since 1 large button is worth 3 small buttons, we can convert the small buttons into large buttons:
     - 27 small buttons / 3 = 9 large buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has:
     - Remaining small stickers = 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers.
     - Large stickers = 40 (unchanged).
     - Large buttons = 9 (newly acquired).

3. **Trading Large Stickers**:
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker can be traded for either 1 large button or 3 small buttons. Since we need to calculate the total buttons, we will convert them into large buttons:
     - 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons.
   - So, after this trade, Lorraine has:
     - Remaining large stickers = 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers.
     - Large buttons = 9 + 20 = 29 large buttons.

4. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers**:
   - The remaining 20 large stickers are traded for small buttons:
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small stickers, so:
     - 20 large stickers = 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.
   - Now, after this trade, Lorraine has:
     - Remaining large stickers = 0 (since all are traded).
     - Large buttons = 29 (unchanged).
     - Small buttons = 60 (newly acquired).

5. **Total Buttons**:

   - **Large (L)**: Half as many students need size large as size medium. Therefore:
     \[
     \text{L} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{M} = \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9
     \]

   - **Extra-large (XL)**: It is mentioned that six more students need size extra-large than large. Therefore:

1. **Identify the number of bananas:** George has 200 bananas.

2. **Calculate the number of pears:** George has 45% more pears than bananas. 
   - First, we need to find out what 45% of the number of bananas is:
     \[
     45\% \text{ of } 200 = \frac{45}{100} \times 200 = 0.45 \times 200 = 90
     \]
   - Now, we add this amount to the number of bananas to find the number of pears:
     \[
     \text{Number of pears} = \text{Number of bananas} + 45\% \text{ of Number of bananas} = 200 + 90 = 290
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of fruits:** Now, we add the number of bananas and pears together to get the total number of fruits:
   \[
   \text{Total fruits} = \text{Number of bananas} + \text{Number of pears} = 200 + 290 = 490

   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   For hiking:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_{\text{hike}} = 20 \text{ miles per hour} \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Determine the total time for the trip**: 
   The total time for the trip is 6 hours, which includes both driving and hiking. We already know they spent 1.5 hours hiking, so the time spent driving is:
   \[
   \text{Time}_{\text{drive}} = 6 \text{ hours} - 1.5 \text{ hours} = 4.5 \text{ hours}

Let's denote:
- \( E_a \) = the number of enemies Ava jumps on
- \( E_e \) = the number of enemies Emma jumps on
- \( B_a \) = the number of berries Ava collects
- \( B_e \) = the number of berries Emma collects
- \( T_a \) = the time Ava has left (in seconds)
- \( T_e \) = the time Emma has left (in seconds)

From the problem statement, we know:
1. Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma:
   \[ E_a = E_e + 8 \]
   
2. Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma:
   \[ B_a = B_e + 3 \]

3. Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma:
   \[ T_a = T_e - 4 \]

The score for each player can be calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Score} = 10 \times \text{(number of enemies jumped on)} + 5 \times \text{(number of berries collected)} + 30 \times \text{(seconds left)}
\]

Now, let's calculate the scores for both Ava and Emma:

**Ava's Score**:
\[
\text{Score}_a = 10 \times E_a + 5 \times B_a + 30 \times T_a
\]
Substituting \( E_a \), \( B_a \), and \( T_a \):
\[
\text{Score}_a = 10 \times (E_e + 8) + 5 \times (B_e + 3) + 30 \times (T_e - 4)
\]
Expanding this:
\[
\text{Score}_a = 10E_e + 80 + 5B_e + 15 + 30T_e - 120
\]
Combining like terms:
\[
\text{Score}_a = 10E_e + 5B_e + 30T_e - 25
\]

**Emma's Score**:
\[
\text{Score}_e = 10 \times E_e + 5 \times B_e + 30 \times T_e
\]

Now we can find the difference between their scores:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Score}_a - \text{Score}_e

Substituting the scores:
\[
\text{Difference} = (10E_e + 5B_e + 30T_e - 25) - (10E_e + 5B_e + 30T_e)

\[
\text{Difference} = -25

gsm8k,gsm8k-782,SA,1,"To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the usual riding frequency:**
   - Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days.
   - This means they ride 3 times per day for 5 days.

2. **Calculate the total rides for the usual days:**
   - Total rides on the usual days = 3 rides/day * 5 days = 15 rides.

3. **Identify the riding frequency on the other days:**
   - On two other days, they ride twice the usual amount.
   - The usual amount is 3 rides, so on these two days, they ride 2 * 3 = 6 rides per day.

4. **Calculate the total rides for the special days:**
   - Total rides on the two special days = 6 rides/day * 2 days = 12 rides.

5. **Summing up all the rides for the week:**
   - Total rides for the week = rides on usual days + rides on the special days = 15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides.

gsm8k,gsm8k-783,SA,1,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Fish Count**:
   - Bob initially has 3 orange fish and 4 white fish in his pond.
   - Total fish before buying more: 3 (orange) + 4 (white) = 7 fish.

2. **Fish Bought from the Store**:
   - Bob buys a total of 17 fish from the pet store.
   - Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish he bought as \( W \).
   - The equation for the total number of fish bought is:
     \[
     O + W = 17
     \]

3. **Final Fish Count**:
   - After adding the fish from the store, the total number of orange fish becomes \( 3 + O \) and the total number of white fish becomes \( 4 + W \).

4. **Condition Given**:
   - After adding the new fish, Bob finds that he has twice as many orange fish as white fish:
     \[
     3 + O = 2(4 + W)
     \]

5. **Setting Up the Equations**:
   - From the condition, we can expand the equation:
     \[
     3 + O = 8 + 2W
     \]
   - Rearranging this gives:
     \[
     O - 2W = 5 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
     \]

6. **Solving the System of Equations**:
   - Now we have two equations:
     1. \( O + W = 17 \) (Equation 2)
     2. \( O - 2W = 5 \) (Equation 1)

   - We can solve these equations simultaneously. From Equation 2, we can express \( O \) in terms of \( W \):
     \[
     O = 17 - W
     \]

   - Substituting this expression for \( O \) into Equation 1:
     \[
     (17 - W) - 2W = 5
     \]
   - Simplifying this:
     \[
     17 - 3W = 5
     \]
   - Rearranging gives:
     \[
     3W = 12 \quad \Rightarrow \quad W = 4
     \]

7. **Finding \( O \)**:
   - Now substituting back to find \( O \):
     \[
     O = 17 - W = 17 - 4 = 13
     \]

8. **Final Count Verification**:
   - After buying the fish, Bob has:
     - Orange fish: \( 3 + 13 = 16 \)
     - White fish: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \)
   - Check the condition: \( 16 \) is indeed twice \( 8 \).

Thus, the number of white fish Bob bought at the store is: #### 4",0.0004052999999999,13.485756874084473,174,632,gpt-4o-mini,,,1

### Step 1: Determine the number of groups formed
We have 90 people who need to be divided into groups of 9.

To find the number of groups, we divide the total number of people by the size of each group:

\[
\text{Number of groups} = \frac{90 \text{ people}}{9 \text{ people/group}} = 10 \text{ groups}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate how many groups are involved in bringing back seashells
According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the groups each had members bring back 2 seashells.

First, we find \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total number of groups:

\[
\text{Number of groups bringing seashells} = \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \text{ groups}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of seashells brought back
Each of these 6 groups had members that brought back 2 seashells each. Since each group has 9 members, the total number of seashells brought back by each group is:

\[
\text{Seashells per group} = 2 \text{ seashells/member} \times 9 \text{ members} = 18 \text{ seashells/group}
\]

Now, we multiply the number of groups that brought seashells by the number of seashells each group brought back:

\[
\text{Total seashells} = 6 \text{ groups} \times 18 \text{ seashells/group} = 108 \text{ seashells}

  - Total employees after 2 months: 220 + 20 = 240

- **End of Month 3**:
  - Employees at the start of the month: 240
  - New hires: 20
  - Total employees after 3 months: 240 + 20 = 260

Now, we need to calculate the total salary paid for each month and then sum it up:

- **Salaries for Month 1**:
  - Total employees: 220
  - Total salary: 220 employees × $4000 = $880,000

- **Salaries for Month 2**:

gsm8k,gsm8k-799,SA,1,"1. First, we need to determine the cost of 3 loaves of bread. Since each loaf of bread costs $2, we can calculate the total cost for 3 loaves by multiplying the cost of one loaf by 3.

   Cost of 3 loaves of bread = 3 loaves * $2/loaf = $6.

2. Next, we will calculate the cost of 2 bagels. Each bagel costs $1, so we can find the total cost for 2 bagels by multiplying the cost of one bagel by 2.

   Cost of 2 bagels = 2 bagels * $1/bagel = $2.

3. Now, we need to find out how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels. We do this by subtracting the cost of the bagels from the cost of the loaves.

   Difference in cost = Cost of 3 loaves of bread - Cost of 2 bagels = $6 - $2 = $4.

1. **Identify Pierson's score**: Pierson scored 278 points.

2. **Calculate Nikita's score**: 
   - Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's score.
   - First, we need to find half of Pierson's score: 
     \[
     \text{Half of Pierson's score} = \frac{278}{2} = 139

gsm8k,gsm8k-801,SA,1,"To find out how many trees will be planted in total at Ashley's school, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by both the students and the teachers. 

Step 1: Calculate the number of students.
- There are 40 classes.
- Each class has an average of 25 students.

So, the total number of students is:
Total students = Number of classes × Students per class
Total students = 40 × 25 = 1000 students

Step 2: Calculate the number of teachers.
- Each class has 3 teachers.

So, the total number of teachers is:
Total teachers = Number of classes × Teachers per class
Total teachers = 40 × 3 = 120 teachers

Step 3: Calculate the number of trees planted by students.
- Each student plants 1 tree.

So, the total number of trees planted by students is:
Trees by students = Total students × Trees per student
Trees by students = 1000 × 1 = 1000 trees

Step 4: Calculate the number of trees planted by teachers.
- Each teacher plants 2 trees.

So, the total number of trees planted by teachers is:
Trees by teachers = Total teachers × Trees per teacher
Trees by teachers = 120 × 2 = 240 trees

Step 5: Calculate the total number of trees planted.
Total trees planted = Trees by students + Trees by teachers
Total trees planted = 1000 + 240 = 1240 trees

gsm8k,gsm8k-802,SA,1,"To determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy so that they represent 30% of her total collection of stuffed animals, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has**:
   - Stuffed puppies: 3
   - Stuffed koalas: 5
   - Stuffed zebras: 2
   - Stuffed frogs: 4

   Total = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

2. **Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles will buy**. After buying the goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be:
   - Total after buying goats = 14 + \( x \)

3. **Set up the equation based on the percentage condition**:
   We want the number of stuffed goats to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. This can be expressed mathematically as:
   \[
   \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30
   \]

4. **Clear the fraction by multiplying both sides by \( 14 + x \)**:
   \[
   x = 0.30(14 + x)
   \]

5. **Distribute the 0.30**:
   \[
   x = 4.2 + 0.30x
   \]

6. **Isolate \( x \)** by subtracting \( 0.30x \) from both sides:
   \[
   x - 0.30x = 4.2
   \]
   \[
   0.70x = 4.2
   \]

7. **Divide both sides by 0.70 to solve for \( x \)**:

1. **Determine total earnings per climb:** Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. 

2. **Calculate the total number of branches climbed during the week:** He made a total of $105 in a week. To find the total number of branches climbed, we need to divide his total earnings by the fee per branch. 

   Total branches climbed = Total earnings / Fee per branch
   
   Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25

3. **Perform the division:**
   To divide $105 by $0.25, we can convert $0.25 into a fraction. $0.25 is the same as 25/100 or 1/4. 

   Dividing by 0.25 is equivalent to multiplying by 4 (since dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal). 

   So, we can calculate:
   Total branches climbed = $105 × 4 = $420

4. **Determine the average branches climbed per day:** Since a week has 7 days, we will divide the total number of branches climbed by 7 to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

1. **Identify the components and relationships:**
   - Let \( S \) be the amount of salt (in ounces).
   - Since Tanya uses the same amount of sugar as salt, the amount of sugar is also \( S \).
   - Let \( O \) be the amount of oil (in ounces).
   - Since Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, we have \( O = 2S \).
   - Let \( F \) be the amount of fragrance (in ounces).
   - Since she uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, the amount of citrus zest is also \( F \).
   - Since she uses the same amount of salt as zest, and twice as much salt as zest, we can express the relationships as follows:
     - \( S = 2F \) (because salt is twice the amount of zest, which is the same as fragrance).

2. **Set up the equation for total weight:**
   - The total weight of the scrub must equal 10 ounces.
   - Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     S + S + O + F + F = 10
     \]
   - Simplifying this, we have:
     \[
     2S + O + 2F = 10
     \]

3. **Substituting the values:**
   - From our earlier relationships, we know:
     - \( O = 2S \)
     - \( F = \frac{S}{2} \) (since \( S = 2F \))
   - Substitute \( O \) and \( F \) into the total weight equation:
     \[
     2S + 2S + 2\left(\frac{S}{2}\right) = 10
     \]
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     2S + 2S + S = 10

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let PJ's number of cards be denoted as \( p \).
   - Let Smendrick's number of cards be denoted as \( s \).
   - Let Becca's number of cards be denoted as \( b \).

2. **Write down the relationships**:
   - From the problem statement, we know:
     - The total number of cards is 341: 
       \[
       b + s + p = 341
       \]
     - Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick:
       \[
       b = s + 12
       \]
     - Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has:
       \[
       s = 3p
       \]

3. **Substitute the relationships**:
   - Substitute \( s = 3p \) into the equation for Becca:
     \[
     b = 3p + 12
     \]
   - Now substitute both \( b \) and \( s \) into the total card equation:
     \[
     (3p + 12) + (3p) + p = 341
     \]

4. **Combine like terms**:
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     3p + 12 + 3p + p = 341
     \]
     \[
     7p + 12 = 341
     \]

5. **Isolate \( p \)**:
   - Subtract 12 from both sides:
     \[
     7p = 341 - 12
     \]
     \[
     7p = 329
     \]
   - Now divide by 7:
     \[
     p = \frac{329}{7}
     \]
     \[
     p = 47
     \]

6. **Find \( s \) and \( b \)**:
   - Now substitute \( p \) back to find \( s \):
     \[
     s = 3p = 3 \times 47 = 141
     \]
   - Substitute \( s \) to find \( b \):
     \[
     b = s + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153

1. **Identify how much Eva has saved:**
   - Eva has saved $20.00.

2. **Determine how much Anthony has saved:**
   - We know that Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva.
   - Since Eva has saved $20.00, we can calculate Anthony's savings:
     \[
     \text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
     \]
   - Therefore, Anthony has saved $30.00.

3. **Calculate how much Roy has saved:**
   - Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony.
   - First, we need to find 40% of Anthony's savings:
     \[
     40\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.40 \times 30 = 12
     \]
   - Now, to find out how much Roy has saved, we add this amount to Anthony's savings:
     \[
     \text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + 12 = 30 + 12 = 42

1. **Calculate the distance for the first part of the journey:**
   - Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour.
   - He travels for 4 hours.
   - The distance for this part can be calculated using the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
     \]
   - So for the first part:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_1 = 8 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 32 \text{ miles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the distance for the second part of the journey:**
   - After resting, Mason continues to travel at the same rate of 8 miles per hour.
   - He travels for another 6 hours.
   - Again using the distance formula:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_2 = 8 \text{ miles/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 48 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Add the distances from both parts of the journey to find the total distance:**
   - Total distance traveled:
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 32 \text{ miles} + 48 \text{ miles} = 80 \text{ miles}

1. **Understanding the kangaroos' travel time**:
   - It takes 3 kangaroos a total of 18 hours to cross the highway. Since they are all traveling at the same speed, we can determine that the time it takes for one kangaroo to cross the highway is also 18 hours.

2. **Determining the speed of the kangaroos**:
   - Let’s denote the speed of a kangaroo as \( v \). The distance covered by the kangaroos can be expressed as \( \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \).
   - For the kangaroos, the distance is \( d = v \times 18 \) hours.

3. **Understanding the turtles' speed**:
   - The turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. Therefore, the speed of a turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

4. **Calculating the time taken by the turtles**:
   - We need to find out how long it will take for the turtles to cover the same distance \( d \) at their speed.
   - Using the distance formula again for the turtles, we have:
     \[
     d = \text{Speed of turtles} \times \text{Time taken by turtles}
     \]
   - Substituting the known values, we have:
     \[
     d = \left(\frac{v}{2}\right) \times t
     \]
   - We already know \( d = v \times 18 \), so we can set the two expressions for distance equal to each other:
     \[
     v \times 18 = \left(\frac{v}{2}\right) \times t
     \]

5. **Solving for \( t \)**:
   - We can simplify this equation. First, divide both sides by \( v \) (assuming \( v \neq 0 \)):
     \[
     18 = \frac{1}{2} \times t
     \]
   - To solve for \( t \), multiply both sides by 2:
     \[
     t = 36 \text{ hours}
     \]

Finally, the time it will take for four turtles to cross the highway is 36 hours.

1. **Identify how many dishes Kora made**: According to the problem, Kora made 20 dishes.

2. **Determine how many dishes Rory made**: The problem states that Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora. Since Kora made 20 dishes, we can calculate Rory's dishes as follows:
   \[
   \text{Rory's dishes} = \text{Kora's dishes} + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40
   \]

3. **Determine how many dishes Jada made**: The problem also states that Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory. Now that we know Rory made 40 dishes, we can calculate Jada's dishes:
   \[
   \text{Jada's dishes} = 2 \times \text{Rory's dishes} = 2 \times 40 = 80
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of dishes made by all three**: Now we can find the total by adding the number of dishes made by Kora, Rory, and Jada together:
   \[
   \text{Total dishes} = \text{Kora's dishes} + \text{Rory's dishes} + \text{Jada's dishes} = 20 + 40 + 80

1. **Determine the new price of the laptop after the trade-in**: 
   The original price of the laptop is $600. If Erika trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200:
   \[
   600 - 200 = 400
   \]
   So, the new price of the laptop is $400.

2. **Calculate the total amount of money Erika has**: 
   - She has some savings in her purse (let's call this amount \( x \)).
   - She earned $150 from her part-time job this week.
   - Her mom is giving her $80.
   
   Therefore, the total money she has can be represented as:
   \[
   x + 150 + 80
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   x + 230
   \]

3. **Determine how much more money Erika needs**: 
   We know that Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which costs $400. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x + 230 = 400 - 50
   \]
   Simplifying the right side:
   \[
   400 - 50 = 350
   \]
   So, we have:
   \[
   x + 230 = 350
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \)**: 
   To find how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to isolate \( x \):
   \[
   x = 350 - 230
   \]
   Performing the subtraction:
   \[
   x = 120
   \]

Thus, Erika has $120 in her purse.

   - Floral shirts: 50

2. **Determine the number of white shirts with collars:**
   - Half of the white shirts have collars: 
     \[
     \text{White shirts with collars} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
     \]
   - Therefore, the number of white shirts without collars:
     \[
     \text{White shirts without collars} = 40 - 20 = 20
     \]

3. **Determine the number of floral shirts with buttons:**
   - Given that 20 of the floral shirts have buttons.
   - Thus, the number of floral shirts without buttons:

2. Next, we will calculate the total number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year:
   \[
   \text{Pairs of shoes per year} = 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year}
   \]

3. Now that we know James buys 24 pairs of shoes in a year, we can find out how much he pays on average for each pair of shoes. He spends $2640 on shoes each year, so we divide the total annual spending by the total number of pairs he buys.

4. Let's perform the arithmetic:
   \[
   \text{Average cost per pair} = \frac{\text{Total annual spending}}{\text{Total pairs bought}} = \frac{2640}{24}

   The total number of rooms at the KozyInn Motel is 90. We need to find out how many rooms constitute one-half of this total.
   \[
   \text{Number of rooms to clean} = \frac{90}{2} = 45
   \]

2. **Calculate the total time to clean those rooms**:
   It takes housekeeping 20 minutes to clean each room. To find the total time required to clean 45 rooms, we multiply the number of rooms by the time taken to clean each room.
   \[
   \text{Total cleaning time (in minutes)} = 45 \text{ rooms} \times 20 \text{ minutes/room} = 900 \text{ minutes}

- Let your age be \( x \).
- Since you are three years younger than your brother, we can denote your brother's age as \( x + 3 \).
- You are also two years older than your sister, so we can denote your sister's age as \( x - 2 \).
- Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age, which can be expressed as \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \).

Now, let's set up the equation based on the information provided that the sum of all ages equals 87:

1. Your age: \( x \)
2. Your brother's age: \( x + 3 \)
3. Your sister's age: \( x - 2 \)
4. Your mom's age: \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \)

The total sum of ages can be written as:

\[
x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + [3(x + 3) - 1] = 87

Now, let's simplify this step-by-step:

1. Combine like terms:
   - Combine \( x \): \( x + x + x = 3x \)
   - Combine constants: \( 3 - 2 = 1 \)
   - Mom's age: \( 3(x + 3) - 1 = 3x + 9 - 1 = 3x + 8 \)

Putting it all together, we have:

     \[
     S + A + F = 85
     \]
   - Sofie has 25 more books than Anne:
     \[
     S = A + 25
     \]
   - Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn:
     \[
     A = F - 12
     \]

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   - From the second equation, we can express \( S \) in terms of \( A \):
     \[
     S = A + 25
     \]
   - From the third equation, we can express \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
     \[
     A = F - 12
     \]
   - Substitute \( A \) into the equation for \( S \):
     \[
     S = (F - 12) + 25
     \]
     \[
     S = F + 13
     \]

4. **Substitute into the Total Books Equation:**
   - Now, substitute \( S \) and \( A \) into the total books equation:
     \[
     (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     3F + 1 = 85
     \]
   - Subtract 1 from both sides:
     \[
     3F = 84
     \]
   - Divide by 3:
     \[
     F = 28
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Fawn has 28 books.

1. **Identify the weight of the potatoes:**
   Daisy bought a bag of potatoes that weighed 5 pounds.

2. **Calculate the weight of the sweet potatoes:**
   The sweet potatoes weighed 2 times as much as the potatoes. 
   So, the weight of the sweet potatoes = 2 * (weight of the potatoes) = 2 * 5 pounds = 10 pounds.

3. **Calculate the weight of the carrots:**
   The carrots weighed 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes.
   So, the weight of the carrots = (weight of the sweet potatoes) - 3 pounds = 10 pounds - 3 pounds = 7 pounds.

Now, we have determined that the weight of the carrots is 7 pounds.

2. **Identify Julie's sales**: We know that Julie sold 14 glasses.

3. **Calculate the boys' sales**: Since Julie sold 14 glasses, we can find out how many glasses the boys sold together by subtracting Julie's sales from the total sales:
   \[
   \text{Total glasses sold by boys} = \text{Total glasses} - \text{Glasses sold by Julie}

   - Total earnings from selling the rope = Length of the rope × Price per meter
   - Total earnings = 20 meters × $2/meter = $40.

2. **Determine how much the new rope will cost:**
   - Sarah plans to buy a new rope that costs $1.5 a meter.
   - We need to determine how much of the new rope she can buy with her $40. 
   - If she buys x meters of the new rope, the cost of the new rope will be $1.5 × x.

     - The main concert, which is twice as long as her usual concerts.
     - The encore, which lasts 15 minutes.

2. **Set up the equation**:
   - Let \( x \) represent the length of Elaina's usual concerts in minutes.
   - Therefore, the length of the final concert (main concert) is \( 2x \).
   - The total runtime of the final concert is given as 65 minutes. This includes both the main concert and the encore.

3. **Formulate the equation**:
   - We can express the total runtime of the final concert as:
     \[
     2x + 15 = 65
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - First, subtract 15 from both sides:
     \[
     2x = 65 - 15
     \]
     \[
     2x = 50
     \]
   - Next, divide both sides by 2:
     \[
     x = \frac{50}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 25
     \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The length of Elaina's usual concerts is 25 minutes.

1. **Starting Amount of Toys**: Argo begins with 200 toys.

2. **Toys Given Away**:
   - Argo gives 40 toys to Alyssa.
   - He gives 80 toys to Bonnie.
   - He gives 30 toys to Nicky.

3. **Total Toys Given Away**:
   - We need to add the number of toys given to each person:
     - 40 (to Alyssa) + 80 (to Bonnie) + 30 (to Nicky).
   - Let's perform the arithmetic:
     - First, add 40 and 80:  
       40 + 80 = 120.
     - Next, add this result to 30:  
       120 + 30 = 150.

   So, the total number of toys given away is 150.

1. **Determine the number of microphones that won't fit:**
   The singer has a total of 50 microphones, and 20% of these microphones won't find any space to fit in. 

   To find 20% of 50, we can use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Number of microphones not fitting} = 50 \times 0.20
   \]

   Calculating this gives:
   \[
   50 \times 0.20 = 10
   \]

   So, 10 microphones will not have space.

2. **Calculate the number of microphones that can be arranged:**
   If 10 microphones cannot fit, then the number of microphones that can actually be arranged is:
   \[
   \text{Microphones fitting} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Determine how many pairs can be formed:**
   Microphones can be arranged in pairs, so we need to divide the number of fitting microphones by 2:
   \[
   \text{Number of pairs} = \frac{\text{Microphones fitting}}{2} = \frac{40}{2}
   \]

   Calculating this gives:
   \[

1. **Identify the relationships between the spinning speeds**:
   - Let the speed of the thingamabob be \( T \) (in meters per second).
   - The whirligig spins at five times the speed of the thingamabob, so the speed of the whirligig \( W \) is:
     \[
     W = 5T
     \]
   - The whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob, so the speed of the whatchamacallit \( H \) is:
     \[
     H = 11T
     \]

2. **Use the information given about the whatchamacallit**:
   - We know that the speed of the whatchamacallit is 121 meters per second:
     \[
     H = 121 \text{ m/s}

     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the salad and yogurt**:

gsm8k,gsm8k-894,SA,1,"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

1. **Understanding the Work Done**: 
   - Let the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn be \( x \).
   - Then, according to the problem:
     - The number of times she mowed Kamala's lawn is \( 3x \) (three times as many as Joe's).
     - The number of times she mowed Alba's lawn is \( 5x \) (five times as many as Joe's).

2. **Calculating Payments from Mowing**:
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for mowing his lawn. Therefore, her total earnings from Joe's work is:
     \[
     \text{Earnings from Joe} = 6
     \]
   - The earnings from Kamala and Alba's lawns are unknown, but we can express them in terms of \( x \) if we know how much Tasha charges for mowing:
     - Let's denote Tasha's charge per mowing session as \( p \).
     - So, earnings from Kamala's lawn:
     \[
     \text{Earnings from Kamala} = 3x \cdot p
     \]
     - Earnings from Alba's lawn:
     \[
     \text{Earnings from Alba} = 5x \cdot p
     \]

3. **Total Earnings from Mowing**:
   - The total earnings from mowing lawns can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Total Earnings from Mowing} = 6 + 3x \cdot p + 5x \cdot p
   \]
   - This simplifies to:
   \[
   \text{Total Earnings from Mowing} = 6 + (3x + 5x)p = 6 + 8xp
   \]

4. **Total Earnings from All Sources**:
   - We know from the problem that Tasha made $80 in total from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. Thus:
   \[
   80 = 6 + 8xp + L
   \]
   where \( L \) is the money made from selling lemonade.

5. **Finding \( L \)**:
   - Rearranging the equation gives us:
   \[
   L = 80 - (6 + 8xp)
   \]
   - Simplifying further:
   \[
   L = 80 - 6 - 8xp = 74 - 8xp
   \]

6. **Determining Values**:
   - To find \( L \), we need the value of \( xp \). However, we currently do not have enough information to determine \( x \) or \( p \) directly from the information given in the problem.
   - Since we need to find \( L \) without knowing \( x \) or \( p \), we can analyze the situation: 
     - If Tasha mowed Joe's lawn 1 time (so \( x = 1 \)), then:
       \[
       \text{Earnings from Joe's lawn} = 6
       \]
       \[
       \text{Earnings from Kamala's lawn} = 3 \cdot 1 \cdot p = 3p
       \]
       \[
       \text{Earnings from Alba's lawn} = 5 \cdot 1 \cdot p = 5p
       \]
       \[
       \text{Total Earnings from Mowing} = 6 + 3p + 5p = 6 + 8p
       \]
       - Substituting back into the total earnings equation:
       \[
       80 = 6 + 8p + L \Rightarrow L = 74 - 8p
       \]
       - If \( p = 1 \) (assuming she charges $1 per mowing), then:
       \[
       L = 74 - 8 \cdot 1 = 66
       \]
       - If \( p = 2 \) (assuming she charges $2 per mowing), then:
       \[
       L = 74 - 8 \cdot 2 = 58
       \]
       - If \( p = 3 \), then:
       \[
       L = 74 - 24 = 50
       \]
     - Thus, without knowing how much she charges per mowing session, we can't find a unique value for \( L \).

7. **Conclusion**:
   - If we assume Tasha could have earned a significant amount from lemonade, let's use the scenario where she might not have mowed too much. For example, if she mowed Joe's lawn once and did not have high rates for the others, we can estimate conservatively.
   - Let’s assume she made $50 from lemonade sales, which would yield:

   - Adults: 2 (Calvin and his wife)
   - Children: 2 (the two kids)
   - Total bowls at dinner = 2 (adults) + 2 (children) = 4 bowls.

2. Next, we know from the problem that the pot has enough soup to fill four adult bowls or eight child's bowls. Since Calvin and his wife are adults, they will consume 4 adult bowls. This means the entire pot of soup will be used up at dinner:
   - Total soup used = 4 adult bowls.

3. Since all the soup is consumed at dinner, there will be no leftover soup for lunch. Thus, the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup is:
   - Leftover soup = 0 adult bowls or 0 child's bowls.
   - Each child can have 0 bowls for lunch.

1. **Determine the material needed for small masks:**
   - Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
   - Therefore, the amount of material needed for 1 small mask is:
     \[
     \text{Material per small mask} = \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards}
     \]
   - To find out how much material is needed for 20 small masks, we multiply the material needed for one small mask by the number of small masks:
     \[
     \text{Material for 20 small masks} = 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards/mask} = 10 \text{ yards}
     \]

2. **Determine the material needed for large masks:**
   - Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
   - Therefore, the amount of material needed for 1 large mask is:
     \[
     \text{Material per large mask} = \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards}
     \]
   - To find out how much material is needed for 8 large masks, we multiply the material needed for one large mask by the number of large masks:
     \[
     \text{Material for 8 large masks} = 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards/mask} = 6 \text{ yards}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total material needed:**
   - Now we add the material needed for both small and large masks:
     \[
     \text{Total material} = \text{Material for small masks} + \text{Material for large masks}

1. **Identify Duncan's current age**: 
   Duncan is currently 60 years old.

2. **Determine Duncan's age eight years ago**: 
   To find Duncan's age eight years ago, we subtract 8 from his current age:
   \[
   60 - 8 = 52
   \]
   So, Duncan was 52 years old eight years ago.

3. **Set up the relationship between Duncan's and Adam's ages**:
   We know that Duncan's age eight years ago (52) was two times Adam's age four years ago. Let's denote Adam's current age as \( A \). Therefore, Adam's age four years ago would be:
   \[
   A - 4
   \]
   According to the problem, we have the equation:
   \[
   52 = 2 \times (A - 4)
   \]

4. **Solve for Adam's current age**:
   First, we simplify the equation:
   \[
   52 = 2A - 8
   \]
   Next, we add 8 to both sides:
   \[
   52 + 8 = 2A
   \]
   \[
   60 = 2A
   \]
   Now, we divide by 2 to find \( A \):
   \[
   A = 30
   \]

   - It is given that \( r = 20 \) (the number of red balloons).
   - The total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58.

2. **Set up the equation for the total pieces of bologna:**
   - The total pieces of bologna thrown at red balloons can be expressed as \( 2r \).
   - The total pieces of bologna thrown at yellow balloons can be expressed as \( 3y \).
   - The equation representing the total pieces of bologna thrown is:

3. **Substitute the known value of \( r \):**
   - Substituting \( r = 20 \) into the equation:
     \[
     2(20) + 3y = 58
     \]
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     40 + 3y = 58

   - Larry has 3 cats.

2. **Calculate the number of dogs:**
   - He has 3 times as many dogs as cats.
   - Number of dogs = 3 * Number of cats = 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

3. **Calculate the number of rabbits:**
   - He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs.
   - Number of rabbits = Number of dogs - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

4. **Calculate the number of fish:**
   - He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits.
   - Number of fish = 3 * Number of rabbits = 3 * 7 = 21 fish.

5. **Calculate the number of gerbils:**
   - He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has.
   - Number of gerbils = 1/3 * Number of fish = 1/3 * 21 = 7 gerbils.

6. **Total up all the pets:**
   - Total number of pets = Number of cats + Number of dogs + Number of rabbits + Number of fish + Number of gerbils
   - Total = 3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47.

Now, we can conclude the total number of pets Larry has.

gsm8k,gsm8k-923,SA,1,"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

1. **Understanding the total cups and their distribution:**
   - Lana has a total of 27 cups.
   - She divides these cups into 3 rows, which means each row will have an equal number of cups.

2. **Calculating the cups in each row:**
   - To find out how many cups are in each row, we divide the total number of cups by the number of rows:
     \[
     \text{Cups per row} = \frac{27 \text{ cups}}{3 \text{ rows}} = 9 \text{ cups per row}
     \]

3. **Determining the cups of tea:**
   - Each row has an equal amount of chamomile and mint tea. 
   - Let's denote the number of cups of chamomile tea in each row as \( C \) and the number of cups of mint tea in each row as \( M \). 
   - Since the cups are divided equally into chamomile and mint tea cups, we have:
     \[
     C + M = 9
     \]

4. **Calculating the cinnamon tea cups:**
   - Lana uses the remaining cups to brew cinnamon tea. We know she brews a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea.
   - First, we need to determine how many cups are used for chamomile and mint tea. Since there are 3 rows, we can write:
     \[
     \text{Total chamomile and mint tea cups} = 3 \times (C + M) = 3 \times 9 = 27 \text{ cups}
     \]
   - Since she has 27 cups total, and she brews 15 cups of cinnamon tea, we need to check how the cups are distributed:
     - The total cups used for chamomile and mint tea should actually equal the total cups she has minus the cups used for cinnamon tea:
     \[
     27 \text{ cups} - 15 \text{ cups (cinnamon)} = 12 \text{ cups (chamomile + mint)}
     \]
   - Since there are 3 rows, and each row has equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea:
     \[
     \text{Total cups of chamomile and mint} = 12 \text{ cups}
     \]
   - Thus, per row, this gives:
     \[
     \text{Cups of chamomile and mint per row} = \frac{12 \text{ cups}}{3 \text{ rows}} = 4 \text{ cups per row}
     \]

5. **Finding mint tea cups per row:**
   - Since chamomile and mint tea are equally divided in each row, we can conclude:
     \[
     C = M = 4 \text{ cups}
     \]

Therefore, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:

1. **Understanding the time and trips**: The sloth takes 4 hours for a round trip to collect berries. Since he has 8 hours total, we can determine how many trips he can make in that time.

2. **Calculating the number of trips**: 
   - If each trip takes 4 hours, then in 8 hours, the number of trips he can make is:
     \[
     \text{Number of trips} = \frac{\text{Total time}}{\text{Time per trip}} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
     \]

3. **Total berries needed**: The sloth wants to collect a total of 24 berries.

4. **Calculating the number of berries per trip**: 
   - To find out how many berries he needs to pick per trip, we divide the total number of berries by the number of trips:
     \[
     \text{Berries per trip} = \frac{\text{Total berries}}{\text{Number of trips}} = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip}

   - The pool contains 10,000 gallons of water.
   - Anthony and his father fill a tank with half the amount of water in the pool. Therefore, the amount of water in the tank is:
     \[
     \text{Water in tank} = \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - The tank is being emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day.
   - We need to find out how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days of emptying it at this rate.

2. **Perform the arithmetic carefully:**
   - First, calculate how much water is used from the tank in 6 days:

1. **Identify the number of Junebugs removed each day:**
   - On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
   - On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as Monday:
     \[
     2 \times 39 = 78
     \]
   - On Wednesday, she again removed twice as many as Monday:
     \[
     2 \times 39 = 78
     \]
   - On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
   - On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

2. **Now, let's list the number of Junebugs removed each day:**
   - Monday: 39
   - Tuesday: 78
   - Wednesday: 78
   - Thursday: 48
   - Friday: 57

3. **Calculate the total number of Junebugs removed during the week:**
   \[
   39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
   \]

   Now let's perform the arithmetic step by step:
   - First, sum Monday and Tuesday:
     \[
     39 + 78 = 117
     \]
   - Then add Wednesday:
     \[
     117 + 78 = 195

1. **Define variables**:
   - Let \( P \) be Peter's age.
   - Let \( p \) be Paul's age.
   - Let \( j \) be John's age.

2. **Set up the equations based on the information given**:
   - The combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years:
     \[
     P + p + j = 100
     \]
   - Paul is 10 years older than John:
     \[
     p = j + 10
     \]
   - Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age:
     \[
     P = p + j
     \]

3. **Substitute the second equation into the first**:
   We can substitute \( p = j + 10 \) into the first equation:
   \[
   P + (j + 10) + j = 100
   \]
   Simplifying this gives:
   \[
   P + 2j + 10 = 100
   \]
   \[
   P + 2j = 90 \quad (1)
   \]

4. **Substitute the second equation into the third**:
   Now we substitute \( p = j + 10 \) into the third equation:
   \[
   P = (j + 10) + j
   \]
   Simplifying this gives:
   \[
   P = 2j + 10 \quad (2)
   \]

5. **Set equations (1) and (2) equal to solve for \( j \)**:
   From (1), we have:
   \[
   P = 90 - 2j
   \]
   Setting this equal to (2):
   \[
   90 - 2j = 2j + 10
   \]
   Rearranging gives:
   \[
   90 - 10 = 2j + 2j
   \]
   \[
   80 = 4j
   \]
   Dividing both sides by 4:
   \[
   j = 20
   \]

6. **Find \( p \) using \( j \)**:
   Now that we have \( j = 20 \), we can find \( p \):
   \[
   p = j + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
   \]

7. **Finally, find \( P \)**:
   Substitute \( j \) back into equation (2) to find \( P \):
   \[
   P = 2j + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50

- Let \( A \) be the points scored by Azibo.
- Let \( B \) be the points scored by Bahati.
- Let \( D \) be the points scored by Dinar.

From the problem, we know:

1. The total points scored by all three is 45:
   \[
   A + B + D = 45
   \]

2. Bahati scored the most points, and his score is related to Azibo and Dinar:
   - Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo:
   \[
   B = A + 20
   \]
   - Bahati scored 10 more than Dinar:
   \[
   B = D + 10
   \]

Now, we can use these equations to express everything in terms of \( A \).

First, we can substitute \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:

From \( B = A + 20 \):
\[
D + 10 = A + 20
\]

Now we solve for \( D \):
\[
D = A + 20 - 10
\]
\[
D = A + 10
\]

Now we have \( B \) and \( D \) expressed in terms of \( A \):
- \( B = A + 20 \)
- \( D = A + 10 \)

Next, we substitute \( B \) and \( D \) back into the total points equation:
\[
A + (A + 20) + (A + 10) = 45
\]

Combining like terms:
\[
A + A + 20 + A + 10 = 45
\]
\[
3A + 30 = 45
\]

Now, we solve for \( A \):
\[
3A = 45 - 30
\]
\[
3A = 15
\]
\[
A = 5
\]

Now that we have \( A \), we can find \( B \) and \( D \):
\[
B = A + 20 = 5 + 20 = 25
\]
\[
D = A + 10 = 5 + 10 = 15
\]

So, the scores are:
- Azibo (A) = 5 points
- Bahati (B) = 25 points
- Dinar (D) = 15 points

Finally, we need to find how many points Azibo scored:
\[
\text{Points scored by Azibo} = A = 5

gsm8k,gsm8k-953,SA,1,"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the usual sleep duration**:
   - Kim goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - This means she typically sleeps for 8 hours (from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.).

2. **Convert the sleep time into minutes**:
   - 8 hours = 8 × 60 = 480 minutes.

3. **Consider the changes in her routine that day**:
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual. 
   - Normally, she wakes up at 6 a.m., but on this day, she woke up at 5:55 a.m.

4. **Determine the total time she was awake**:
   - She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. 
   - The duration of sleepwalking can be calculated as follows:
     - From 2:15 to 2:38 is 23 minutes (2:15 to 2:30 is 15 minutes, and from 2:30 to 2:38 is an additional 8 minutes).

5. **Calculate the total time she was asleep**:
   - Since she woke up at 5:55 a.m., we need to find out how long she was asleep from 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m.
   - This is from 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m., which is 7 hours and 55 minutes.
   - Convert this to minutes: 
     - 7 hours = 7 × 60 = 420 minutes,
     - Plus the additional 55 minutes = 420 + 55 = 475 minutes.

6. **Subtract the time she was sleepwalking**:
   - Since she was sleepwalking for 23 minutes, we need to subtract this from the total sleep time.
   - 475 minutes (total sleep time) - 23 minutes (sleepwalking time) = 452 minutes.

7. **Final calculation**:
   - Therefore, the total amount of time Kim actually slept on her bed that day is 452 minutes.

   - To find the number of occupied beds:
     \[
     \text{Occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200
     \]

2. **Calculate the initial number of unoccupied beds**:
   - The total number of beds is 1000, and if 200 are occupied, then the number of unoccupied beds is:
     \[
     \text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 200 = 800
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks**:
   - There are 14 days in 2 weeks.
   - If 50 patients are admitted each day, then the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks is:
     \[
     \text{Total patients admitted} = 50 \times 14 = 700
     \]

4. **Update the number of occupied beds after 2 weeks**:
   - After 2 weeks, we add the 700 new patients to the initial 200 occupied beds:
     \[
     \text{New occupied beds} = 200 + 700 = 900

   Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day.

2. **Determine the number of work emails**: 
   Robyn sends 7 work emails.

3. **Calculate the number of non-work emails**: 
   To find the non-work emails, we subtract the work emails from the total emails:
   \[
   \text{Non-work emails} = \text{Total emails} - \text{Work emails} = 16 - 7 = 9
   \]

4. **Determine how many of the non-work emails are to family**: 
   It is stated that two-thirds of the remainder (non-work emails) are to family. So we calculate two-thirds of 9:
   \[
   \text{Family emails} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6
   \]

5. **Calculate the remaining emails after the family emails**: 
   To find the remaining emails, we subtract the family emails from the non-work emails:
   \[
   \text{Remaining emails} = \text{Non-work emails} - \text{Family emails} = 9 - 6 = 3

1. **Understanding Courtney's Report**: Courtney reported that the audience was 48 people.

2. **Understanding Kelly's Statement**: Kelly claims that Courtney overstated the number of attendees by 20%. This means that Courtney's reported number (48) is 120% of the actual number of attendees.

3. **Setting Up the Equation**: If we let \( x \) represent the actual number of people who attended the concert, then according to Kelly, we have:
   \[
   120\% \text{ of } x = 48
   \]
   This can also be written as:

1. **Identify the relationships between the number of balls carried by each boy**:
   - Let the number of balls Jeffrey carried be \( x \).
   - Since Jason carried twice as many as Jeffrey, we have:
     \[
     \text{Number of balls Jason carried} = 2x
     \]
   - Jordan carried twice as many as Jason, so:
     \[
     \text{Number of balls Jordan carried} = 2(2x) = 4x
     \]

2. **Given information**:
   - We know from the problem statement that Jason picked up and carried 2 balls. Therefore:
     \[
     2x = 2
     \]
   - From this equation, we can solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 1
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of balls carried by each boy**:
   - Jeffrey carried \( x = 1 \) ball.
   - Jason carried \( 2x = 2 \times 1 = 2 \) balls.
   - Jordan carried \( 4x = 4 \times 1 = 4 \) balls.

4. **Sum the total number of balls carried by the three boys**:
   - Total number of balls:
     \[
     \text{Total} = \text{Balls carried by Jeffrey} + \text{Balls carried by Jason} + \text{Balls carried by Jordan}

   - On the first day, the pirates dug 10 holes.

2. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the second day:**
   - On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
   - Total holes after the second day = 10 (first day) + 13 (second day) = 23 holes.

3. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:**
   - On the third day, they dug 8 holes but filled in 2 holes.
   - Holes dug on the third day = 8 - 2 = 6 holes.
   - Total holes after the third day = 23 (after second day) + 6 (after third day) = 29 holes.

4. **Determine how many holes there are by the end of the fourth day:**
   - According to the problem, the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day.
   - Number of holes at the end of the first day = 10 holes.
   - Therefore, holes by the end of the fourth day = 4 * 10 = 40 holes.

5. **Calculate the number of holes dug on the fourth day:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of holes dug on the fourth day.
   - The total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is the number of holes at the end of the third day plus the holes dug on the fourth day:
   - So, \( 29 (after third day) + x = 40 \).
   - Now, solve for \( x \):

Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips. Collins received 15 more corn chips than either Amora or Lainey.

Step 2: Calculate the number of corn chips Collins received.  
Since Amora and Lainey received 70 corn chips each, we can find out how many corn chips Collins received by adding 15 to the amount that Amora or Lainey received.  
So, Collins received:  
70 (corn chips of Amora or Lainey) + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of corn chips.  
Now we can find the total number of corn chips by adding the amounts received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:  
Total = Amora's corn chips + Lainey's corn chips + Collins' corn chips  
Total = 70 + 70 + 85.

Step 4: Perform the arithmetic.  
Total = 70 + 70 + 85

1. **Define the Variables**:
   - Let \( A \) be the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
   - Let \( S \) be the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
   - Let \( D \) be the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

2. **Set Up the Equations**:
   - From the problem, we know that together they have caught 339 Pokemon:
     \[
     A + S + D = 339
     \]
   - Alex has caught 5 more than Stan:
     \[
     A = S + 5
     \]
   - Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught:
     \[
     S = 4D - 13
     \]

3. **Substitute the Equations**:
   - We can substitute \( A \) in the first equation using the second equation:
     \[
     (S + 5) + S + D = 339
     \]
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     2S + D + 5 = 339
     \]
   - Subtract 5 from both sides:
     \[
     2S + D = 334
     \]

4. **Substitute \( D \) using Stan's equation**:
   - We can rearrange the third equation to express \( D \):
     \[
     D = \frac{S + 13}{4}
     \]
   - Now, substitute this expression for \( D \) into the equation \( 2S + D = 334 \):
     \[
     2S + \frac{S + 13}{4} = 334
     \]

5. **Clear the Fraction**:
   - Multiply every term by 4 to eliminate the fraction:
     \[
     8S + (S + 13) = 1336
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     9S + 13 = 1336
     \]
   - Subtract 13 from both sides:
     \[
     9S = 1323
     \]
   - Divide by 9:
     \[
     S = 147

2. **Second Segment (North)**:
   - The bird then flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled = speed × time = 18 miles/hour × 2 hours = 36 miles.

3. **Third Segment (South)**:
   - Finally, the bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled = speed × time = 22 miles/hour × 5 hours = 110 miles.

2. To find the number of players on Zeke's team, we will add the 7 additional players to the 13 players on Carlton's team:
   Zeke's team = Carlton's team + 7
   Zeke's team = 13 + 7
   Zeke's team = 20 players

3. Now, we will find the total number of players on both teams combined. We do this by adding the number of players on Carlton's team to the number of players on Zeke's team:
   Total players = Carlton's team + Zeke's team
   Total players = 13 + 20
   Total players = 33 players

1. **Calculate the perimeter of the garden**:
   The garden is rectangular with a length of 15 feet and a width of 10 feet. 
   The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:
   \[
   P = 2 \times (length + width)
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   P = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of wooden slats needed**:
   Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing. We already calculated that the perimeter is 50 feet.
   Therefore, the total number of wood slats needed can be calculated by multiplying the perimeter by the number of slats per foot:
   \[
   \text{Total slats} = 50 \text{ feet} \times 2 \text{ slats/foot} = 100 \text{ slats}
   \]

Thus, Robert will need a total of 100 wooden slats for the fencing.

1. **Determine the total number of boxes and oranges:**
   Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges. Each box contains 20 oranges. 
   So, the total number of oranges is:
   \[
   \text{Total oranges} = \text{Number of boxes} \times \text{Oranges per box} = 12 \times 20 = 240
   \]

2. **Calculate how many boxes she gave away:**
   She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes each:
   \[
   \text{Total boxes given away} = 2 + 2 = 4
   \]

3. **Determine how many boxes she has left:**
   After giving away 4 boxes, the number of boxes she has left is:
   \[
   \text{Boxes left} = 12 - 4 = 8
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of oranges left after giving away boxes:**
   Since she has 8 boxes left and each box contains 20 oranges, the number of oranges she has now is:
   \[
   \text{Oranges left} = 8 \times 20 = 160
   \]

5. **Calculate how many oranges she keeps:**
   Mrs. Harrington keeps 1/4 of the oranges. Therefore, the number of oranges she keeps is:
   \[
   \text{Oranges kept} = \frac{1}{4} \times 160 = 40
   \]

6. **Calculate how many oranges she sells:**
   To find out how many oranges she sells, we subtract the number of oranges she keeps from the total number of oranges she has:
   \[
   \text{Oranges sold} = \text{Oranges left} - \text{Oranges kept} = 160 - 40 = 120

   - Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil.
   - They are planting 10 carnations.
   - Total soil used for carnations = 10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds.

4. **Calculate the total soil used so far**:
   - Total soil used = soil used for sunflowers + soil used for carnations.
   - Total soil used = 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds.

5. **Determine the remaining soil for roses**:
   - Remaining soil = total soil - total soil used = 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds.

6. **Determine how many roses can be planted**:
   - Each rose needs 1 pound of soil.
   - Therefore, the number of roses that can be planted = remaining soil / soil per rose = 3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses.

1. **Calculate Jessica's monthly savings for shoes**: 
   Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets aside 25% of her paycheck for shoes. To find out how much she saves each month, we calculate 25% of $2,000.00.

   \[
   \text{Monthly savings} = 2000 \times 0.25 = 500
   \]

   So, she saves $500.00 each month for shoes.

2. **Calculate her annual savings for shoes**: 
   Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply her monthly savings by 12 to find out how much she saves in a year.

   \[
   \text{Annual savings} = 500 \times 12 = 6000
   \]

   Thus, she saves $6,000.00 in a year for shoes.

3. **Determine the number of pairs of shoes she can buy**: 
   Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy with her annual savings, we divide her total savings by the cost per pair of shoes.

   \[
   \text{Number of shoes} = \frac{6000}{1000} = 6
   \]

   Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

gsm8k,gsm8k-989,SA,1,"To solve the problem, we need to determine how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp. We'll break this down into two parts: peeling the shrimp and cooking the shrimp.

1. **Peeling the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To find out how long it will take her to peel 90 shrimp, we use the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Time to peel} = \frac{\text{Number of shrimp}}{\text{Shrimp peeled per minute}} = \frac{90}{6} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Cooking the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To find out how long it takes to cook 90 shrimp, we first find out how many batches of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp:
     \[
     \text{Number of batches} = \frac{90}{30} = 3 \text{ batches}
     \]
   - Since it takes 10 minutes to sauté one batch of 30 shrimp, for 3 batches it will take:
     \[
     \text{Time to sauté} = 3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total Time:**
   - Now we add the time taken to peel and the time taken to sauté:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = \text{Time to peel} + \text{Time to sauté} = 15 + 30 = 45 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 45 minutes.

   - Comet Halley has a cycle of 75 years.
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw it.

2. **Determine the Age of Bill's Dad**:
   - When Bill's dad first saw the comet, he was 30 years old.

3. **Calculating the Age of Bill's Dad When Bill Saw the Comet Again**:
   - Since the comet appears every 75 years, Bill's dad will see the comet again when he is 30 + 75 = 105 years old.

4. **Time Passed Since Bill's Dad First Saw the Comet**:
   - The time passed between the first and second sightings of the comet is 75 years.

5. **Bill's Age When He Saw the Comet the Second Time**:
   - When Bill's dad saw the comet the second time at age 105, we need to find Bill's age at that time.
   - Bill is three times the age his father was when he first saw the comet. His dad was 30 then, so:
     \[
     \text{Bill's age} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ years old}
     \]

6. **Finding Bill's Age When He Saw the Comet for the First Time**:
   - Since 75 years passed from the time his dad first saw the comet to the time Bill saw it again:
     \[
     \text{Bill's age when he first saw the comet} = 90 - 75 = 15 \text{ years old}

1. **Electric Bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the electric bill. 
   - Number of checks per year = 1 check/month * 12 months = 12 checks.

2. **Gas Bill**: Buford also writes one check per month for the gas bill.
   - Number of checks per year = 1 check/month * 12 months = 12 checks.

3. **Church**: Buford writes two checks per month to the church.
   - Number of checks per year = 2 checks/month * 12 months = 24 checks.

4. **Pest and Lawn Service**: Buford writes one check quarterly for the pest and lawn service.
   - Number of checks per year = 1 check/quarter * 4 quarters = 4 checks.

Now we will add all these checks together to find the total number of checks Buford writes per year:

Total checks = Electric Bill checks + Gas Bill checks + Church checks + Pest and Lawn Service checks
Total checks = 12 + 12 + 24 + 4

Now, performing the arithmetic:

12 + 12 = 24

1. **Identify the flights of the second plane**: The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and we know that this number represents half of the flights made by the first plane. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

   \[
   \text{Flights by the first plane} = 2 \times 44 = 88
   \]

   So, the first plane makes 88 flights in total each day.

2. **Determine the flights to Greece, France, and Germany**: According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. Let's calculate that:

   \[
   \text{Flights to Greece} = \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66

1. **Identify the howling times of each wolf:**
   - **Tobias:** Each howl lasts for 20 seconds.
   - **Chikote:** Howls for twice as long as Tobias, so:
     \[
     \text{Chikote's howl time} = 2 \times 20 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds}
     \]
   - **Igneous:** Howls for as long as the other two wolves combined. Therefore, we first need to calculate the combined time of Tobias and Chikote:
     \[
     \text{Combined time of Tobias and Chikote} = 20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} = 60 \text{ seconds}
     \]
     So, Igneous howls for 60 seconds.

2. **Add the howling times of all three wolves:**
   - The total time of howls is:
     \[
     \text{Total howl time} = \text{Tobias's time} + \text{Chikote's time} + \text{Igneous's time}
     \]
     \[

   \[
   2 \times 6 = 12
   \]
   So, Adam received $12 from his father.

4. **Calculate the total amount of money Adam received from his parents**: Add the money from his mother and father together:
   \[
   6 + 12 = 18
   \]
   Adam received a total of $18 from his parents.

5. **Determine how much money Adam contributed from his own savings**: Since the trousers cost $30 and he received $18 from his parents, we can find out how much he contributed by subtracting the money he received from the total cost:

1. **Identify the known ages**:
   - Akbar = 3 years old
   - Alessandro = 4 years old
   - Let Wilfred's age = W years
   - Let Helene's age = H years

2. **Calculate the total age**:
   We know that the total age of all four children is 20 years. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   3 + 4 + W + H = 20
   \]
   Simplifying this gives:
   \[
   W + H = 20 - 7 = 13 \quad (1)
   \]

3. **Relate Helene's age to the average age**:
   We also know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. To find the average age of the four children, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Average age} = \frac{3 + 4 + W + H}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
   \]
   Therefore, Helene's age can be expressed as:
   \[
   H = 2 \times \text{Average age} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \quad (2)
   \]

4. **Substituting Helene's age**:
   Now we can substitute Helene's age (from equation (2)) into equation (1):
   \[
   W + 10 = 13

   - Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, the size of each adult's slice will be \( 2k \).

2. **Calculate total shares**:
   - There are 4 kids, so the total size of the kids' slices will be \( 4k \).
   - There are 2 adults, and since each adult gets \( 2k \), the total size of the adults' slices will be \( 2 \times 2k = 4k \).
   - Therefore, the total size of the watermelon is the sum of the sizes of the kids' and adults' slices:
     \[
     \text{Total size} = \text{Total kids' slices} + \text{Total adults' slices} = 4k + 4k = 8k.

gsm8k,gsm8k-1005,SA,1,"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

1. **Determine the number of female porcupines:**
   The total population of porcupines in the park is 50. The number of female porcupines is given as \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

2. **Determine the number of male porcupines:**
   Since there are 50 porcupines in total and 30 of them are female, the number of male porcupines is:
   
   \[
   \text{Number of male porcupines} = 50 - 30 = 20
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of baby porcupines born in a year:**
   Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. First, we find out how many babies one female porcupine will have in a year (12 months).
   
   \[
   \text{Babies per female per year} = 4 \times 12 = 48
   \]

   Now, since there are 30 female porcupines, the total number of babies born in a year is:
   
   \[
   \text{Total babies in a year} = 30 \times 48 = 1440
   \]

4. **Calculate the total population after a year:**
   The total population after a year will be the initial population plus the number of babies born.
   
   \[
   \text{Total population after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
   \]

1. **Calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet.**
   The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is:
   \[
   \text{Volume} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Depth}
   \]
   Given:
   - Length = 25 feet
   - Width = 14 feet
   - Depth = 4 feet

   Now, substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Volume} = 25 \, \text{ft} \times 14 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft}
   \]

   Performing the multiplication:
   \[
   25 \times 14 = 350
   \]
   Now, multiply by the depth:
   \[
   350 \times 4 = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet}
   \]

2. **Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.**
   The problem states to multiply the volume in cubic feet by 5.9 to find the number of gallons needed.
   \[
   \text{Gallons} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 5.9
   \]

   Performing the multiplication:
   \[
   1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \, \text{gallons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost to fill the pool.**
   The cost is $0.10 per gallon. Therefore, we will multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon:
   \[
   \text{Cost} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10
   \]

   Performing this multiplication:
   \[
   8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \, \text{dollars}

1. **Identify the quantities:**
   - Red sticks: 9
   - Blue sticks: There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks. Therefore, we calculate the number of blue sticks as follows:
     \[
     \text{Blue sticks} = \text{Red sticks} + 5 = 9 + 5 = 14
     \]
   - Yellow sticks: The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. We calculate the number of yellow sticks as follows:

gsm8k,gsm8k-1012,SA,1,"To solve the problem, we need to determine the initial charge of the power bank before Maria went to the park. We know the final charge remaining after several hours of usage. Let's break down the steps:

1. **Understanding the Timeline and Charges**:
   - Maria's power bank loses 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, it starts losing 7% of its total capacity each hour for another 3 hours.
   - Finally, the remaining charge is 28%.

2. **Calculating the Charge After 5 Hours**:
   - Let the initial charge of the power bank when Maria left be \(x\).
   - After 5 hours losing 9% each hour:
     - Charge remaining after 1 hour = \(x - 0.09x = 0.91x\)
     - Charge remaining after 2 hours = \(0.91x - 0.09(0.91x) = 0.91x \times 0.91 = 0.91^2 x\)
     - Charge remaining after 3 hours = \(0.91^2 x \times 0.91 = 0.91^3 x\)
     - Charge remaining after 4 hours = \(0.91^3 x \times 0.91 = 0.91^4 x\)
     - Charge remaining after 5 hours = \(0.91^4 x \times 0.91 = 0.91^5 x\)

3. **Calculating the Charge After an Additional 3 Hours**:
   - Now, after 5 hours, the power bank starts losing 7% each hour:
     - Charge remaining after 6 hours = \(0.91^5 x - 0.07(0.91^5 x) = 0.91^5 x \times 0.93 = 0.91^5 \times 0.93 x\)
     - Charge remaining after 7 hours = \(0.91^5 \times 0.93 x - 0.07(0.91^5 \times 0.93 x) = 0.91^5 \times 0.93 x \times 0.93 = 0.91^5 \times 0.93^2 x\)
     - Charge remaining after 8 hours = \(0.91^5 \times 0.93^2 x - 0.07(0.91^5 \times 0.93^2 x) = 0.91^5 \times 0.93^2 x \times 0.93 = 0.91^5 \times 0.93^3 x\)

4. **Final Charge Remaining**:
   - After the 8 hours, the remaining charge is given as 28%, which can be expressed as:
   \[
   0.91^5 \times 0.93^3 x = 0.28
   \]

5. **Calculating the Initial Charge \(x\)**:
   - To find \(x\), we first calculate \(0.91^5\) and \(0.93^3\):
   - Calculate \(0.91^5\):
     \[
     0.91^5 \approx 0.6593
     \]
   - Calculate \(0.93^3\):
     \[
     0.93^3 \approx 0.804357
     \]
   - Now multiply these values:
   \[
   0.91^5 \times 0.93^3 \approx 0.6593 \times 0.804357 \approx 0.5309
   \]
   - Now substitute back into the equation:
   \[
   0.5309x = 0.28
   \]
   - Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{0.5309} \approx 0.526
   \]

6. **Final Result**:
   - Expressing \(x\) as a percentage:
   \[
   x \approx 52.6\% \text{ of the total capacity}
   \]

1. **Bananas picked on Wednesday**: John picks 4 bananas.
   
2. **Bananas picked on Thursday**: John picks 6 bananas.
   
3. **Bananas picked on Friday**: John picks triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday. Since he picked 4 bananas on Wednesday, on Friday he picks:
   - 3 times 4 = 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

Now, we need to find the total number of bananas John has after picking them on all three days.

4. **Calculating the total**:
   - Bananas picked on Wednesday: 4
   - Bananas picked on Thursday: 6
   - Bananas picked on Friday: 12

5. **Adding them up**:

1. **Determine the number of easy questions:**
   Given that 40% of the 60 questions are easy:
   \[
   \text{Number of easy questions} = 0.40 \times 60 = 24
   \]

2. **Determine the number of average and difficult questions:**
   Since the rest of the questions are equally divided as average and difficult, we first find the total number of remaining questions:
   \[
   \text{Remaining questions} = 60 - 24 = 36
   \]
   Since these are equally divided between average and difficult, we have:
   \[
   \text{Number of average questions} = \text{Number of difficult questions} = \frac{36}{2} = 18
   \]

3. **Calculate how many easy questions Aries is sure to get correct:**
   Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correctly:
   \[
   \text{Correct easy questions} = 0.75 \times 24 = 18
   \]

4. **Calculate how many average and difficult questions Aries is sure to get correct:**
   Aries is sure to get half of the average and difficult questions correctly. First, we calculate for average questions:
   \[
   \text{Correct average questions} = 0.5 \times 18 = 9
   \]
   And for difficult questions:
   \[
   \text{Correct difficult questions} = 0.5 \times 18 = 9
   \]

5. **Total points Aries is sure to get:**
   Now we sum the points from easy, average, and difficult questions:
   \[
   \text{Total points} = \text{Correct easy questions} + \text{Correct average questions} + \text{Correct difficult questions}

1. **Identifying the price of the stuffed animals**:
   - Each small stuffed animal costs $4.
   - Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals. Therefore, the price of a large stuffed animal is:
     \[
     3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Defining the quantities sold**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold.
   - According to the problem, Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones. Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
     \[
     2x
     \]

3. **Calculating the total earnings**:
   - Earnings from selling large stuffed animals:
     \[

   - Total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is:
     \[
     12x + 8x = 20x \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Setting up the equation**:
   - We know that Teresa earned $120 from the sales:
     \[
     20x = 120
     \]

5. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 20:
     \[
     x = \frac{120}{20} = 6
     \]

6. **Calculating the number of small stuffed animals sold**:
   - Since the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \):

   Total initial balloons = 25 (red) + 7 (green) + 12 (yellow) = 44 balloons.

2. **Calculate the number of red balloons that burst:**
   - 40% of the red balloons burst.
   - Number of red balloons that burst = 40% of 25 = 0.4 * 25 = 10 balloons.

   Remaining red balloons = 25 - 10 = 15 balloons.

3. **Calculate the number of yellow balloons Sally accidentally released:**

gsm8k,gsm8k-1030,SA,1,"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to analyze the different scenarios based on the information given.

1. **Scenarios**:
   - There is a 50% chance that a substitute teacher will be present, in which case the homework will not be collected.
   - If the normal teacher is present (which has a 50% chance), there are two further possibilities:
     - There's a 40% chance she will give everyone an extension (in which case, Marcus will not have to turn in his homework).
     - If she does not give an extension (which has a 60% chance), there’s a 20% chance that Marcus can convince her to give him a personal extension (meaning he won't have to turn in his homework).
     - Conversely, there’s an 80% chance that he cannot convince her, and he will have to turn in his homework.

2. **Calculating Probabilities**:
   - Let’s denote the probabilities step by step:
     - Probability of substitute teacher = 0.5 (50%)
     - Probability of normal teacher = 0.5 (50%)
       - If normal teacher:
         - Probability of extension = 0.4 (40%)
         - Probability of no extension = 0.6 (60%)
           - If no extension:
             - Probability Marcus convinces her = 0.2 (20%)
             - Probability Marcus does not convince her = 0.8 (80%)
  
3. **Overall Probability of Not Having to Turn in Homework**:
   - If the substitute teacher is present, Marcus does not need to turn in homework:
     - P(Not turning in homework with substitute) = 0.5
   - If the normal teacher is present, and she gives an extension:
     - P(Not turning in homework with normal teacher and extension) = 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2
   - If the normal teacher is present, she does not give an extension, and Marcus convinces her:
     - P(Not turning in homework with normal teacher, no extension, and convincing) = 0.5 * 0.6 * 0.2 = 0.06
   - Total probability of not having to turn in homework:
     - P(Not turning in homework) = P(Substitute) + P(Normal teacher and extension) + P(Normal teacher, no extension, and convincing)
     - P(Not turning in homework) = 0.5 + 0.2 + 0.06 = 0.76

4. **Probability of Having to Turn in Homework**:
   - The probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is the complement of him not having to turn it in:
     - P(Turning in homework) = 1 - P(Not turning in homework)
     - P(Turning in homework) = 1 - 0.76 = 0.24

gsm8k,gsm8k-1038,SA,1,"To solve this problem step by step, we’ll break down the components involved in Jim's college decision and how long it will take for him to earn back the loans and lost income.

1. **Understanding the Costs**:
   - Jim takes out $50,000 in loans each year for 4 years. 
   - Therefore, the total amount of loans he accumulates is:
     \[
     \text{Total Loans} = 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000
     \]

2. **Lost Income**:
   - Before college, Jim earned $25,000 per year. 
   - For 4 years of college, the total income he loses is:
     \[
     \text{Lost Income} = 25,000 \times 4 = 100,000
     \]

3. **Total Financial Burden**:
   - The total burden Jim faces, which includes both the loans and the lost income, is:
     \[
     \text{Total Burden} = \text{Total Loans} + \text{Lost Income} = 200,000 + 100,000 = 300,000
     \]

4. **Income After College**:
   - After college, Jim's income triples. His new income is:
     \[
     \text{New Income} = 25,000 \times 3 = 75,000
     \]

5. **Time to Earn Back the Burden**:
   - To find out how long it will take Jim to earn back the total burden of $300,000 at his new income of $75,000 per year, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total Burden}}{\text{New Income}} = \frac{300,000}{75,000} = 4
     \]

So, it will take Jim 4 years to earn back the amount equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

1. **Determine the dimensions of the bed**: The bed measures 6 feet long and 8 feet wide.

2. **Calculate the dimensions needed for the fabric**: Jim needs each piece of fabric to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. 
   - Length of fabric for one piece: 
     - Bed length + 2 feet = 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet
   - Width of fabric for one piece: 
     - Bed width + 2 feet = 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

3. **Calculate the area of one piece of fabric**: 
   - Area = Length × Width
   - Area of one piece = 8 feet × 10 feet = 80 square feet

4. **Determine the total area of fabric needed**: Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2.
   - Total area = 2 × Area of one piece = 2 × 80 square feet = 160 square feet

Now we can summarize the calculations:

Total fabric needed = 160 square feet.

1. **Letters delivered on Monday**: 
   The post office delivered 425 letters.

2. **Letters delivered on Tuesday**: 
   We need to calculate how many letters were delivered on Tuesday. According to the problem, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of the number delivered on Monday. 
   - First, we calculate one-fifth of Monday's delivery:
     \[
     \text{One-fifth of Monday's delivery} = \frac{425}{5} = 85
     \]
   - Now, we add 17 to this amount:
     \[
     \text{Tuesday's delivery} = 85 + 17 = 102
     \]

3. **Letters delivered on Wednesday**: 
   Now, we will find out how many letters were delivered on Wednesday. The problem states they delivered 5 more than twice the number delivered on Tuesday.
   - First, we calculate twice Tuesday's delivery:
     \[
     \text{Twice Tuesday's delivery} = 2 \times 102 = 204
     \]
   - Then, we add 5 to this amount:
     \[
     \text{Wednesday's delivery} = 204 + 5 = 209
     \]

4. **Total letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday**: 
   Finally, we add the letters delivered on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday together:
   \[
   \text{Total delivery} = 425 + 102 + 209
   \]
   We calculate:
   - First, add Monday and Tuesday:
     \[
     425 + 102 = 527
     \]
   - Then, add Wednesday's delivery:
     \[
     527 + 209 = 736

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5. 
   - This can be represented as:
     \[
     \text{Loss}_1 = -5
     \]

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race. 
   - First, we calculate twice the amount lost in the first race:
     \[
     2 \times (-5) = -10
     \]
   - Now, we find the amount won in the second race:
     \[
     \text{Win}_2 = -10 + 1 = -9
     \]
   - Since winnings are typically a positive amount, we interpret this as he won $9. 

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. 
   - First, we calculate 1.5 times the amount won in the second race:
     \[
     1.5 \times 9 = 13.5
     \]
   - Thus, his loss in the third race is:
     \[
     \text{Loss}_3 = -13.5
     \]

4. **Total Loss and Win Calculation:**
   - Now we sum up the amounts from all three races:
   - Total loss:
     \[
     \text{Total Loss} = \text{Loss}_1 + \text{Loss}_3 = -5 + (-13.5) = -18.5
     \]
   - Total winnings:
     \[
     \text{Total Win} = \text{Win}_2 = 9
     \]

5. **Net Amount:**
   - To find the net amount, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Net Amount} = \text{Total Loss} + \text{Total Win} = -18.5 + 9 = -9.5
     \]
   - This indicates a net loss of $9.5.

6. **Average Loss Calculation:**
   - To find the average loss per race, we consider the total losses and the number of races (3):
   - Average loss:
     \[
     \text{Average Loss} = \frac{\text{Total Loss}}{\text{Number of Races}} = \frac{-18.5}{3} \approx -6.1667
     \]

Finally, rounding the average loss to two decimal places gives us:
\[
\text{Average Loss} = -6.17

1. **Identify Initial Heights**:
   - Xavier's initial height: 4 feet.
   - Cole's initial height: 50 inches.

2. **Convert Xavier's Height to Inches**:
   - We know that 1 foot = 12 inches. 
   - Therefore, Xavier's height in inches is:
     \[
     4 \text{ feet} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ inches}

gsm8k,gsm8k-1045,SA,1,"Let's denote the amount that the first person took as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \) (which is $80 more than the first).
- The third person took \( 2(x + 80) \) (which is twice what the second took).

Now, we can express the total amount taken by all three people in terms of \( x \):

1. The first person's share: \( x \)
2. The second person's share: \( x + 80 \)
3. The third person's share: \( 2(x + 80) \)

Next, we can write the equation for the total amount:

\[
x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920
\]

Now, let's simplify this equation:

1. Combine like terms:
   - The first and second terms: \( x + x = 2x \)
   - The second term \( + 80 \)
   - The third term: \( 2(x + 80) = 2x + 160 \)

So we rewrite the equation:

\[
2x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920
\]

2. Combine all \( x \) terms and constants:

\[
4x + 240 = 1920
\]

Now, we need to isolate \( x \):

3. Subtract 240 from both sides:

\[
4x = 1920 - 240
\]
\[
4x = 1680
\]

4. Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{1680}{4}

\[
x = 420
\]

Thus, the share of the first person is \( 420 \).

   \[
   \text{Total days} = 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total hours worked by the team**: 
   Each day, the team worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day. Since a full day is typically considered to be 8 hours, we can convert \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day into hours:
   \[
   \text{Hours worked per day} = \frac{3}{8} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours}

1. According to the problem, in the first set, he retrieved four more balls than in the second set. Therefore, the number of balls he retrieved in the first set can be expressed as \( x + 4 \).

2. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set. Thus, the number of balls he retrieved in the third set is \( \frac{x}{2} \).

3. We know the total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
   \]

4. Now, let's simplify this equation step by step. First, combine the \( x \) terms:
   \[
   2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
   \]

5. To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 2:
   \[
   2(2x + 4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2 \cdot 19
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   4x + 8 + x = 38
   \]

6. Combine like terms:
   \[
   5x + 8 = 38
   \]

7. Now, isolate \( x \) by subtracting 8 from both sides:
   \[
   5x = 30
   \]

8. Next, divide both sides by 5:
   \[
   x = 6

9. Now that we have \( x \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in each set:
   - Second set: \( x = 6 \)
   - First set: \( x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \)
   - Third set: \( \frac{x}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \)

10. Finally, let's verify the total:

1. **Determine the area of each tile**: Since each tile is square with a side length of 1 ft, the area of one tile is:
   \[
   \text{Area of one tile} = \text{side} \times \text{side} = 1 \, \text{ft} \times 1 \, \text{ft} = 1 \, \text{SqFt}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of tiles needed**: We need to cover a total area of 200 SqFt with tiles that each cover 1 SqFt. Therefore, the number of tiles required is:
   \[
   \text{Number of tiles} = \frac{\text{Total area}}{\text{Area of one tile}} = \frac{200 \, \text{SqFt}}{1 \, \text{SqFt/tile}} = 200 \, \text{tiles}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost**: Each tile costs $12. To find the total cost for 200 tiles, we multiply the number of tiles by the cost per tile:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of tiles} \times \text{Cost per tile} = 200 \, \text{tiles} \times 12 \, \text{dollars/tile} = 2400 \, \text{dollars}

1. **Determine the increased cost of insurance**:  
   James's insurance cost is 60% more than the normal cost. The normal cost is $120 per month.  
   To find out how much more that is, we calculate 60% of $120:  
   \[
   0.60 \times 120 = 72
   \]  
   This means the increase is $72.

2. **Calculate the total monthly cost**:  
   To find the total monthly cost that James has to pay, we add the increase to the normal cost:  
   \[
   120 + 72 = 192
   \]  
   So, James pays $192 per month for insurance.

3. **Calculate the annual cost**:  
   To find out how much he pays in a year, we multiply the monthly cost by the number of months in a year (12):

   So, the total number of slices is:
   \[
   4 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices/pizza} = 32 \text{ slices}
   \]

2. **Information about how many slices each person ate**: 
   We know:
   - Becky ate 10 slices.
   - Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake.
   - Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake.

3. **Setting up equations**:
   Let's denote the number of slices Jake ate as \( J \). 
   According to the information:
   - Becky’s slices: \( B = J + 3 \)
   - Silvia’s slices: \( S = 2J \)

   We know that Becky ate 10 slices:
   \[
   B = 10
   \]
   Thus, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   J + 3 = 10
   \]

4. **Solving for Jake's slices**:
   To find \( J \), we can rearrange the equation:
   \[
   J = 10 - 3 = 7
   \]

5. **Calculating Silvia's slices**:
   Now that we know Jake ate 7 slices, we can find out how many slices Silvia ate:
   \[
   S = 2J = 2 \times 7 = 14
   \]

6. **Total slices eaten**:
   Now we can add up the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:
   \[

1. **Understanding the variables**:
   - Let \( D \) represent the time Donovan took to prepare his part of the meal.
   - Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, we can express Betsy's time as \( D + 18 \).

2. **Setting up the equation**:
   - The total time taken to prepare the meal is 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the equation as follows:
   \[
   D + (D + 18) = 98
   \]

3. **Simplifying the equation**:
   - Combine like terms:
   \[
   2D + 18 = 98
   \]

4. **Isolating \( D \)**:
   - Subtract 18 from both sides:
   \[
   2D = 98 - 18
   \]
   \[
   2D = 80
   \]
   - Now, divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   D = \frac{80}{2} = 40
   \]

5. **Finding Betsy's time**:
   - Now that we know Donovan's time, which is 40 minutes, we can find Betsy's time:

1. **Cost of the cast**: The doctor charges $200 for the cast.
   - Cost of the cast = $200

2. **Cost of the doctor's visit**: The doctor charges $300 per hour for the visit, and since the visit lasts 30 minutes, we need to convert that into hours.
   - 30 minutes is half an hour, so:
   - Cost for 30 minutes = $300/hour * 0.5 hours = $150

3. **Cost of painkillers**: The doctor charges $4 per pill for 30 painkillers.
   - Total cost for painkillers = $4/pill * 30 pills = $120

4. **Cost of parking**: The doctor charges $6/hour for parking, and there is a mandatory minimum of 2 hours.
   - Cost for parking = $6/hour * 2 hours = $12

Now, let's sum all these costs to find the total cost of the doctor's visit:

- Total cost = Cost of cast + Cost of visit + Cost of painkillers + Cost of parking
- Total cost = $200 + $150 + $120 + $12

Now we perform the arithmetic:

- $200 + $150 = $350

   - Kayla invited 25 classmates and 7 girls from her dance class. Together, that is:
     \[
     25 + 7 = 32 \text{ guests}
     \]
   - She also invited 13 family members, which adds more guests:
     \[
     32 + 13 = 45 \text{ total invited guests}
     \]
   - Out of the 45 invited guests, 4 people said they could not come. Therefore, the number of guests who will attend is:
     \[
     45 - 4 = 41 \text{ guests attending}
     \]
   - The party rental fee is $125 for the first 20 guests, and it costs $6 for each additional guest beyond 20. Since Kayla has 41 guests attending, we need to calculate how many additional guests there are:
     \[
     41 - 20 = 21 \text{ additional guests}
     \]

2. **Perform the arithmetic carefully:**
   - The cost for the additional guests is calculated as:
     \[
     21 \text{ additional guests} \times 6 \text{ dollars/guest} = 126 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The total cost of the party combines the base fee and the cost of additional guests:

1. **Determine the total number of bananas eaten by the monkeys in a week.**
   - Mr. Robles has 315 bananas for a week. This means the three monkeys together eat 315 bananas in 7 days.
   - Therefore, the total number of bananas eaten per day by the three monkeys is:
     \[
     \text{Total bananas per day} = \frac{315 \text{ bananas}}{7 \text{ days}} = 45 \text{ bananas per day}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of bananas consumed by each monkey.**
   - Let's denote the number of bananas eaten by the first monkey as \( x \). According to the problem:
     - The first monkey eats \( x = 10 \) bananas per day.
     - The second monkey eats \( x + 4 = 10 + 4 = 14 \) bananas per day.
     - The third monkey eats the remaining bananas.

3. **Calculate the total bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys.**
   - Total eaten by the first monkey is \( 10 \) bananas.
   - Total eaten by the second monkey is \( 14 \) bananas.
   - So, the total eaten by the first and second monkeys together is:
     \[
     \text{Total for first and second monkeys} = 10 + 14 = 24 \text{ bananas}
     \]

4. **Determine how many bananas the third monkey eats.**
   - To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats, we subtract the total eaten by the first two monkeys from the total eaten by all three monkeys:
     \[
     \text{Bananas eaten by the third monkey} = 45 - 24 = 21 \text{ bananas}
     \]

Therefore, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

   - Jenny buys 15 roses.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 15 roses is:
     \[
     15 \text{ roses} \times 2 \text{ dollars/rose} = 30 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate how much money Jenny has**:
   - Jenny arrives with five $5 bills.
   - The total amount of money she has is:
     \[
     5 \text{ bills} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bill} = 25 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Check if she has enough money**:
   - Jenny needs $30 for the roses, but she only has $25.
   - Therefore, she does not have enough money to buy the 15 roses.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since Jenny cannot afford the 15 roses with her $25, she does not make the purchase and leaves the florist with her original amount of money.

5. **Calculate how many quarters she leaves with**:
   - Jenny has $25 in cash. Let's convert this to quarters:
   - Since there are 4 quarters in a dollar, we calculate the number of quarters as follows:

1. **First Train Arrival:**
   - The first train arrives in 10 minutes.
   - It stays for 20 minutes.
   - Therefore, the first train will leave the station at:
     \[
     10 \text{ minutes (arrival)} + 20 \text{ minutes (stay)} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Second Train Arrival:**
   - The second train arrives half an hour (30 minutes) after the first train leaves.
   - So, the second train will arrive at:
     \[
     30 \text{ minutes (when the first train leaves)} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed (which is 20 minutes).
     - A quarter of 20 minutes is:
     \[

     \]
   - Therefore, the second train will leave the station at:
     \[
     60 \text{ minutes (arrival)} + 5 \text{ minutes (stay)} = 65 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Third Train Arrival:**
   - The third train arrives one hour (60 minutes) after the second train leaves.
   - Thus, it will arrive at:
     \[
     65 \text{ minutes (when the second train leaves)} + 60 \text{ minutes} = 125 \text{ minutes}

   - The distance from James's home to the store is 4 miles.
   - When James gets halfway to the store, he has walked 2 miles (since halfway of 4 miles is 2 miles).

2. **Walking back**: 
   - After walking 2 miles towards the store, he realizes he forgot something and has to walk back to his home. 
   - The distance for him to walk back home is also 2 miles.

3. **Total distance walked**: 
   - James walks 2 miles to get halfway to the store.
   - Then he walks 2 miles back home.
   - Therefore, the total distance he walks is 2 miles (to the halfway point) + 2 miles (back home) = 4 miles.

4. **Calculating the time taken**: 
   - James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.
   - To find out how long it took him to walk the 4 miles, we can use the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} 
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour}
     \]

5. **Conclusion**: 
   - Since James did not reach the store, and the problem asks how long it took him to reach the store, we calculate the time it took him to walk to the halfway point and back:
   - He walked to the halfway point (2 miles) in: 
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - He then walked back home (2 miles) in the same amount of time:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - So the total time spent walking is:

   - Earnings from MTB bikes = Number of MTB bikes * Price of MTB
   - Earnings from MTB bikes = 105 * $500 = $52,500

   - Earnings from BMX bikes = Number of BMX bikes * Price of BMX
   - Earnings from BMX bikes = 45 * $250 = $11,250

   - Earnings from Trekking bikes = Number of Trekking bikes * Price of Trekking
   - Earnings from Trekking bikes = 150 * $450 = $67,500

7. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Earnings from MTB + Earnings from BMX + Earnings from Trekking
   - Total earnings = $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250

1. **Determine the total number of bales made by the farmer in 6 hours:**
   - The farmer makes 5 bales per hour.
   - Over 6 hours, the total number of bales produced by the farmer is:
     \[
     \text{Total bales by farmer} = 5 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ bales}
     \]

2. **Determine the total number of bales picked up by the truck in 6 hours:**
   - The truck picks up 3 bales per hour.
   - Over 6 hours, the total number of bales picked up by the truck is:
     \[
     \text{Total bales picked by truck} = 3 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 18 \text{ bales}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of bales left in the field:**
   - To find the number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales produced by the farmer:

gsm8k,gsm8k-1088,SA,1,"To find out how many hours John spends learning in a week, we can break down the problem into several steps.

1. **Calculate the total number of periods John attends in a week:**
   - A normal student has 6 periods each day.
   - John has 2 extra classes, making his total periods each day: 
     \[
     6 + 2 = 8 \text{ periods}
     \]
   - John goes to class for 5 days a week, so the total number of periods in a week is:
     \[
     8 \text{ periods/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 40 \text{ periods/week}
     \]

2. **Convert periods to minutes:**
   - Each class period is 40 minutes long, so the total time in minutes spent in class per week is:
     \[
     40 \text{ periods/week} \times 40 \text{ minutes/period} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]

3. **Calculate extra learning time on the weekend:**
   - John spends \( \frac{1}{16} \) of his weekly learning time on extra learning each on Saturday and Sunday.
   - First, find out how much time he spends learning in a week (which we calculated as 1600 minutes).
   - Calculate \( \frac{1}{16} \) of 1600 minutes:
     \[
     \frac{1600}{16} = 100 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Therefore, he spends 100 minutes on Saturday and 100 minutes on Sunday, for a total extra learning time of:
     \[
     100 \text{ minutes} + 100 \text{ minutes} = 200 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Add the total learning time in class and extra learning time:**
   - The total learning time in a week is:
     \[
     1600 \text{ minutes} (in class) + 200 \text{ minutes} (extra learning) = 1800 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]

5. **Convert total minutes into hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so to convert 1800 minutes to hours:
     \[
     \frac{1800}{60} = 30 \text{ hours/week}

1. **Calculate the initial height from which the ball is dropped**:
   Each story of the building is 24 feet, and Nathan drops the ball from the third floor. Therefore, the initial height (h) is:
   \[
   h = 3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Determine the height after the first bounce**:
   The ball bounces to \( \frac{2}{3} \) of its initial height after the first bounce. We can calculate this using the initial height:
   \[
   \text{Height after first bounce} = h \times \frac{2}{3} = 72 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Determine the height after the second bounce**:
   The ball will again bounce to \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the height it reached after the first bounce. So we calculate the height after the second bounce:
   \[
   \text{Height after second bounce} = \text{Height after first bounce} \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet}

1. **Identify the height of the first child:**
   - The first child is 6 feet tall. We need to convert this into inches since the other measurements are in inches.
   - There are 12 inches in a foot, so:
     \[
     6 \text{ feet} = 6 \times 12 = 72 \text{ inches}
     \]

2. **Determine the height of the second child:**
   - The second child is two inches taller than the first child.
   - So, we add 2 inches to the height of the first child:
     \[
     \text{Height of second child} = 72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches}
     \]

3. **Calculate the height of the third child:**
   - The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child.
   - We subtract 5 inches from the height of the second child:
     \[
     \text{Height of third child} = 74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches}
     \]

4. **Find the height of the fourth child:**
   - The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child.
   - We add 3 inches to the height of the third child:

1. **Understanding the problem**: 
   - The Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of a small triceratops.
   - After T-Rex ate, half of what was left was eaten by velociraptors.
   - Finally, the Allosaurus consumed the last 270 kilograms of meat.
   - We need to find out how much meat was on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate.

2. **Setting up the equations**:
   - Let \( x \) be the initial weight of the triceratops in kilograms.
   - The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, which is \( \frac{x}{2} \).
   - After T-Rex's meal, the remaining weight of the triceratops is:
     \[
     x - \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{2}
     \]
   - The velociraptors then ate half of what was left:
     \[
     \text{Meat eaten by velociraptors} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4}
     \]
   - The remaining meat after the velociraptors ate is:
     \[
     \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{2x}{4} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4}
     \]
   - The Allosaurus then ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, which means:
     \[
     \frac{x}{4} = 270
     \]

3. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   - To find \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:
     \[
     x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
     \]

Thus, the initial weight of the triceratops was 1080 kilograms.

   - Ellen has a total of 12 sodas.
   - Out of these, 3 sodas are shaken, and the remaining 9 are unshaken (12 - 3 = 9).

2. **Ellen's Action**:
   - Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself.
   - After this, the number of sodas left is:
     - Shaken: 3
     - Unshaken: 8 (9 - 1 = 8)

3. **Ellen's Brother's Action**:
   - Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas.
   - After his action, the remaining sodas are:
     - Shaken: 2 (3 - 1 = 2)
     - Unshaken: 6 (8 - 2 = 6)

4. **Total Sodas Remaining**:
   - After both Ellen and her brother have taken sodas, we have:
     - Total remaining sodas = Shaken + Unshaken = 2 + 6 = 8 sodas.

5. **Calculating the Likelihood**:
   - The likelihood that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is based on the ratio of shaken sodas to total sodas remaining.
   - The number of shaken sodas remaining is 2, and the total number of sodas remaining is 8.

   \[
   \text{Probability (P) of choosing a shaken soda} = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total sodas remaining}} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4}

2. **Miles run by Amber**: 8 miles.
3. **Miles run by Micah**: He ran 3.5 times what Amber ran.

Now we can calculate how many miles Micah ran:

- Since Amber ran 8 miles, we calculate Micah's miles as follows:
  \[
  \text{Micah's miles} = 3.5 \times \text{Amber's miles} = 3.5 \times 8
  \]
  To calculate that:
  \[
  3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles}
  \]

Now we have the miles run by each person:
- Amber: 8 miles
- Micah: 28 miles

Next, we need to find out how many miles Ahito ran. We can do this by subtracting the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles:

\[
\text{Miles run by Ahito} = \text{Total miles} - (\text{Miles run by Amber} + \text{Miles run by Micah})
\]
Substituting in the values we have:
\[
\text{Miles run by Ahito} = 52 - (8 + 28)
\]

Calculating the sum inside the parentheses:
\[
8 + 28 = 36

1. **Define Variables**:
   Let \( x \) be the total number of jellyfish in the tank.

2. **Large Jellyfish**:
   According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large:
   \[
   \text{Number of large jellyfish} = \frac{1}{5}x
   \]

3. **Color Changing Large Jellyfish**:
   It is stated that a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light:
   \[
   \text{Number of large jellyfish that change color} = \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{1}{5}x \right) = \frac{1}{15}x
   \]

4. **Given Information**:
   We know that when the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color:
   \[
   \frac{1}{15}x = 6
   \]

5. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   Now we solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 15:
   \[
   x = 6 \times 15
   \]

gsm8k,gsm8k-1105,SA,1,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many years Lauren needs to work to save enough money for her retirement, given her saving habits and retirement expenses.

### Step 1: Identify Key Figures
- Current Salary: $100,000
- Retirement Period: 20 years
- Percentage of Salary for Retirement: 40%
- Savings Rate: 20%

### Step 2: Calculate Annual Retirement Needs
Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current salary during retirement. 
- Annual Retirement Income Needed = 40% of Current Salary
- Annual Retirement Income Needed = 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000

### Step 3: Calculate Total Retirement Savings Needed
Lauren will need to cover this annual income for 20 years.
- Total Retirement Savings Needed = Annual Retirement Income Needed * Retirement Period
- Total Retirement Savings Needed = $40,000 * 20 = $800,000

### Step 4: Determine Annual Savings
Lauren saves 20% of her current salary from each paycheck.
- Annual Savings = 20% of Current Salary
- Annual Savings = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000

### Step 5: Calculate Years Needed to Save for Retirement
To find out how many years Lauren needs to work to save the total retirement savings needed, we divide the total amount needed by her annual savings.
- Years Needed to Save = Total Retirement Savings Needed / Annual Savings
- Years Needed to Save = $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years

### Conclusion
Lauren needs to work for 40 more years to save enough for her retirement.

1. **Understanding the total distance and time**: Soledad wants to hike a total of 9,300 miles in June. June has 30 days.

2. **Calculating the total miles she plans to hike in her current plan**:
   - She plans to hike twice a day, covering 125 miles each time.
   - Therefore, the total miles she would hike in one day is:
     \[
     125 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 250 \text{ miles/day}
     \]
   - Over 30 days, the total distance she would hike is:
     \[
     250 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7,500 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Comparing her planned distance with the total distance**:
   - Soledad needs to hike a total of 9,300 miles, but with her current plan, she would only hike 7,500 miles.
   - The difference between the total distance she needs to hike and the distance she plans to hike is:
     \[
     9,300 \text{ miles} - 7,500 \text{ miles} = 1,800 \text{ miles}
     \]

4. **Calculating how many more miles she must hike per day**:
   - To find out how many more miles she needs to hike each day, we divide the additional miles by the number of days in June:
     \[
     \frac{1,800 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ miles/day}
     \]

5. **Adding the additional miles to her planned daily hike**:
   - Soledad originally planned to hike 250 miles per day. Now, she needs to add the 60 additional miles:
     \[
     250 \text{ miles/day} + 60 \text{ miles/day} = 310 \text{ miles/day}
     \]

6. **Conclusion**: The question asks how many more miles per day she must hike beyond her original plan. Therefore, the final answer is simply the additional miles per day:

     \text{Total distance Sofie} = 2 \times \text{Total distance Brian}
     \]

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - We know from step 1 that Sofie walks 70 miles in total.
   - Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     70 \text{ miles} = 2 \times \text{Total distance Brian}
     \]

4. **Solve for Brian's Total Distance:**
   - To find the total distance Brian walks, we rearrange the equation:
     \[
     \text{Total distance Brian} = \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles}
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Brian will walk a total of 35 miles in seven days.

gsm8k,gsm8k-1122,SA,1,"To solve the problem, we will break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the production rates of the workers**:
   - We have 5 workers in total.
   - 2 workers produce 6 toys per hour each:
     \[
     2 \text{ workers} \times 6 \text{ toys/hour} = 12 \text{ toys/hour}
     \]
   - 2 workers produce 4 toys per hour each:
     \[
     2 \text{ workers} \times 4 \text{ toys/hour} = 8 \text{ toys/hour}
     \]
   - The total production rate of the first 4 workers:
     \[
     12 \text{ toys/hour} + 8 \text{ toys/hour} = 20 \text{ toys/hour}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total production over the 10-hour shift**:
   - If all 4 workers work for 10 hours:
     \[
     20 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ toys}
     \]

3. **Determine how many toys are needed**:
   - The manufacturer has an order for 400 toys.
   - After working for 10 hours, the 4 workers produced 200 toys:
     \[
     400 \text{ toys (order)} - 200 \text{ toys (produced)} = 200 \text{ toys still needed}
     \]
   - However, the problem states that they still need 20 toys, indicating there was possibly an error in interpretation of the production. Let's check that again:
   - If they still need 20 toys after producing 200, that means they produced 380 toys instead:
   \[
   400 \text{ toys} - 20 \text{ toys} = 380 \text{ toys produced}
   \]

4. **Calculate the contribution of the fifth worker**:
   - If the 4 workers produced 200 toys, and they needed to produce 380 toys in total, then:
   \[
   380 \text{ toys} - 200 \text{ toys} = 180 \text{ toys produced by the fifth worker}
   \]

5. **Determine the rate of the fifth worker**:
   - The fifth worker worked for 10 hours and produced 180 toys:
   \[
   \text{Rate of fifth worker} = \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys/hour}
   \]

Thus, the fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour.

2. **Calculate the weight of Elijah's first dog**: 
   - Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory’s dog.
   - So, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds}
     \]

3. **Calculate the weight of Elijah's second dog**: 
   - Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory’s dog.
   - So, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total weight of all the dogs**: 
   - We need to add the weights of Kory's dog and both of Elijah's dogs together:
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog}
   \]
   - Plugging in the values:
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30
   \]

5. **Perform the final calculation**:
   - First, add 60 and 15:
   \[
   60 + 15 = 75

   - Kris keeps 9 stickers and gives the remaining 7 stickers to Rob.

2. **Setting Up the Variables:**
   - Let the number of stickers Seth initially had be \( S \).
   - After giving half to Luis, Luis has \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.

3. **Luis's Actions:**
   - Luis uses half of his stickers, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \).
   - The number of stickers Luis has left after using half is:
     \[
     \frac{S}{2} - \frac{S}{4} = \frac{S}{4}
     \]
   - Luis gives the \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers to Kris.

4. **Kris's Actions:**
   - Kris keeps 9 stickers and gives 7 stickers to Rob.
   - Thus, the total number of stickers Kris had is:
     \[
     9 + 7 = 16

   - This means \( \frac{S}{4} = 16 \).

5. **Solving for \( S \):**
   - Now, we can solve for \( S \):
     \[
     \frac{S}{4} = 16

   - Liam is currently 16 years old.
   - Two years ago, Liam's age would have been:
     \[
     16 - 2 = 14
     \]

2. **Establish Vince's age two years ago**: 
   - According to the problem, two years ago, Liam’s age was twice the age of Vince.
   - This can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{Liam's age two years ago} = 2 \times \text{Vince's age two years ago}
     \]
   - We know Liam's age two years ago is 14, so we set up the equation:
     \[
     14 = 2 \times \text{Vince's age two years ago}
     \]

3. **Solve for Vince's age two years ago**:
   - To find Vince's age two years ago, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
     \[
     \text{Vince's age two years ago} = \frac{14}{2} = 7
     \]

4. **Determine Vince's current age**:
   - Since Vince was 7 years old two years ago, we can find his current age by adding 2 years:

1. **Define the Variables**:
   - Let \( A \) be the number of eggs Arnold painted.
   - Let \( M \) be the number of eggs Madeline painted.
   - Let \( C \) be the number of eggs Camden painted.
   - Let \( S \) be the number of eggs Sarah painted.

2. **Set Up the Equations**:
   - From the problem, we know that:
     - Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs: \( A = M \).
     - Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs: \( C + S = 30 \).
     - Camden painted 12 more than Sarah: \( C = S + 12 \).

3. **Substituting Values**:
   - We can substitute \( C \) from the third equation into the second equation:
     \[
     (S + 12) + S = 30
     \]
   - Simplifying this gives:
     \[
     2S + 12 = 30
     \]
   - Subtracting 12 from both sides:
     \[
     2S = 18
     \]
   - Dividing by 2:
     \[
     S = 9
     \]

4. **Finding Camden's Eggs**:
   - Now that we have \( S \), we can find \( C \):
     \[
     C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21
     \]

5. **Finding Arnold and Madeline's Eggs**:
   - We know that \( A + M + C + S = 56 \). Since \( A = M \), we can express this as:
     \[
     2A + C + S = 56
     \]
   - Substituting the values we have:
     \[
     2A + 21 + 9 = 56
     \]
   - Simplifying gives:
     \[
     2A + 30 = 56
     \]
   - Subtracting 30 from both sides:
     \[
     2A = 26
     \]
   - Dividing by 2:
     \[
     A = 13

1. **Determine how many groups of crayons Nik can make:**
   - Nik has 200 crayons, and he wants to separate them into groups of 8.
   - To find out how many groups of 8 he can make, we divide the total number of crayons by the size of each group:
     \[
     \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups}
     \]

2. **Calculate the weight of the crayons:**
   - Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so the total weight of all the crayons is:
     \[
     \text{Weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces}
     \]

3. **Calculate the weight of the boxes:**
   - We calculated that Nik can fill 25 boxes (one for each group of 8 crayons).
   - Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of all the boxes is:
     \[
     \text{Weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total weight:**
   - Now we add the weight of the crayons to the weight of the boxes:
     \[
     \text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of crayons} + \text{Weight of boxes} = 200 \text{ ounces} + 200 \text{ ounces} = 400 \text{ ounces}
     \]

5. **Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:**
   - Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we convert the total weight to pounds:
     \[
     \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds}

   - Grandma walks a total of 3 miles: 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk.
   - We know that she spends 40 minutes walking on the beach.

2. **Calculating the Speed on the Beach:**
   - Let \( v \) be Grandma's walking speed on the beach (in miles per minute).
   - Since she walks 2 miles on the beach and it takes her 40 minutes, we can express this as:
     \[
     \text{Speed on the beach} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute}
     \]
   - Therefore, \( v = \frac{1}{20} \) miles per minute.

3. **Calculating the Speed on the Sidewalk:**
   - Grandma walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk, so her speed on the sidewalk is:
     \[
     2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}
     \]

4. **Calculating Time Spent on the Sidewalk:**
   - She walks 1 mile on the sidewalk. The time spent walking on the sidewalk can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes}

gsm8k,gsm8k-1137,SA,1,"To solve the problem, we need to figure out the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug, given the conditions.

1. **Understanding the Situation**: Donny has two mugs of water. One mug has water at 33 degrees, and we need to determine the temperature of the second mug, which we will call \( T \).

2. **Calculating the Temperature After Mixing**: After pouring 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, he is able to drink the resulting mixture. The total amount of water in the bottle is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) ounces.

3. **Using the Concept of Average Temperature**: The temperature of the mixed water can be calculated using the formula for mixing temperatures:

   \[
   \text{Average Temperature} = \frac{(m_1 \cdot T_1 + m_2 \cdot T_2)}{m_1 + m_2}
   \]

   where:
   - \( m_1 = 4 \) ounces (from the 33-degree mug)
   - \( T_1 = 33 \) degrees (temperature of the first mug)
   - \( m_2 = 1 \) ounce (from the second mug)
   - \( T_2 = T \) degrees (unknown temperature of the second mug)

4. **Setting Up the Equation**: We know that the resulting temperature must be at least 40 degrees for Donny to drink it:

   \[
   \frac{(4 \cdot 33 + 1 \cdot T)}{4 + 1} \geq 40
   \]

5. **Calculating the Left Side**:

   \[
   \frac{(132 + T)}{5} \geq 40
   \]

6. **Multiplying Both Sides by 5**:

   \[
   132 + T \geq 200
   \]

7. **Isolating \( T \)**:

   \[
   T \geq 200 - 132
   \]

   \[
   T \geq 68
   \]

Thus, the minimum temperature of the second mug must be at least 68 degrees.

1. **Initial Count of Animals:**
   - Start with 50 cows.
   - Start with 20 chickens.
   - Total initial animals = 50 cows + 20 chickens = 70 animals.

2. **Daily Deliveries:**
   - Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day.
   - Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day.

3. **Duration of Deliveries:**
   - The deliveries occur for three weeks.
   - There are 7 days in a week, so three weeks is 3 * 7 = 21 days.

4. **Total Cows Delivered:**
   - Total cows delivered in 21 days = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows.

5. **Total Chickens Delivered:**
   - Total chickens delivered in 21 days = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens.

6. **Final Count of Animals:**
   - Total cows after deliveries = Initial cows + Delivered cows = 50 cows + 420 cows = 470 cows.
   - Total chickens after deliveries = Initial chickens + Delivered chickens = 20 chickens + 210 chickens = 230 chickens.

7. **Total Animals on the Farm:**

   The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find out how long the second song is, we first need to calculate 60% of the first song's duration:
   - 60% of 5 minutes = 0.60 * 5 minutes = 3 minutes.

   Now, we add this additional time to the duration of the first song to find the total duration of the second song:
   - Duration of the second song = Duration of the first song + Additional time
   - Duration of the second song = 5 minutes + 3 minutes = 8 minutes.

3. **Calculate the total duration of the cassette**:
   Now that we have the durations of both songs, we can find the total duration of the cassette by adding the two durations together:
   - Total duration = Duration of the first song + Duration of the second song
   - Total duration = 5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes.

Now we have the total duration of the cassette.

1. **Determine Isabel's height**: We are given that Isabel is 7 feet tall.

2. **Find Ned's height**: Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel. 
   - So, Ned's height = Isabel's height - 2 feet
   - Ned's height = 7 feet - 2 feet = 5 feet.

3. **Calculate Carl's height**: Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned.
   - So, Carl's height = Ned's height + 1 foot
   - Carl's height = 5 feet + 1 foot = 6 feet.

4. **Find the length of Carl's cane**: The cane is half as long as Carl is tall.
   - So, the length of Carl's cane = Carl's height / 2
   - The length of Carl's cane = 6 feet / 2 = 3 feet.

Putting it all together, the length of Carl's cane is 3 feet.

   - Hortex produces 4200 bottles of carrot juice daily.
   - Each bottle covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand.
   - We need to find out how many bottles are required to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs for 2300 people.

2. **Calculating Total Energy Demand**:
   - If one bottle covers 20% of one person's daily energy needs, then to cover 100% for one person, you would need:
     \[
     \text{Number of bottles per person} = \frac{100\%}{20\%} = 5 \text{ bottles}
     \]
   - For 2300 people, the total number of bottles required is:
     \[
     \text{Total bottles needed} = 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles}
     \]

3. **Calculating the Shortfall**:
   - Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day.
   - To find out how many more bottles are needed, we subtract the current production from the total required:
     \[
     \text{Additional bottles needed} = 11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles}
     \]

4. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, Hortex would need to produce an additional 7300 bottles to satisfy the energy needs of 2300 people.

3. **Identify how many wear bows**:
   - All the blue-wearers wear bows. Since there are 2 blue-wearers, that gives us:
     \[
     \text{Blue wearers with bows} = 2
     \]
   - For the purple wearers, \( \frac{1}{3} \) of them wear bows. Since there are 6 purple-wearers:
     \[
     \text{Purple wearers with bows} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2

1. **Define the variables**:
   - Let the length of the blue rope be \( b \) centimeters.
   - Since the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, we can express the length of the red rope as \( r = 4b \).
   - The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so we can express the length of the yellow rope as \( y = b + 7 \).

2. **Set up the equation for the total length**:
   - According to the problem, the combined length of the three ropes (red, blue, and yellow) is 37 centimeters. Thus, we can write the equation:
     \[
     r + b + y = 37
     \]

3. **Substitute the expressions for \( r \) and \( y \)**:
   - Replace \( r \) and \( y \) in the equation:
     \[
     4b + b + (b + 7) = 37
     \]

4. **Simplify the equation**:
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     4b + b + b + 7 = 37
     \]
     \[
     6b + 7 = 37

5. **Solve for \( b \)**:
   - Subtract 7 from both sides:
     \[
     6b = 30
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 6:
     \[
     b = 5
     \]

6. **Calculate the lengths of the red and yellow ropes**:
   - Now that we have \( b = 5 \):
     - The length of the red rope \( r \) is:
       \[
       r = 4b = 4 \times 5 = 20
       \]
     - The length of the yellow rope \( y \) is:

2. **Determine how much money each has after giving an equal amount to their little sister:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount that both Ronnie and Rissa gave to their little sister.
   - After giving away \( x \), their remaining amounts are:
     - Ronnie: \( 5 - x \)
     - Rissa: \( 15 - x \)

3. **Use the information about Rissa's remaining money:**
   - Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original amount. So:

   We know that the total amount of paint used in the mural is 12 pints.

2. **Identifying the proportions of paint colors:**  
   We have four colors: red, white, purple, and yellow.  
   It is stated that red, white, and purple paint are in equal amounts. Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint each as \( x \).

3. **Amount of yellow paint:**  
   It is given that half the mural is yellow. Therefore, the amount of yellow paint used is:
   \[
   \text{Yellow paint} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \text{ pints} = 6 \text{ pints}
   \]

4. **Setting up the equation:**  
   Since red, white, and purple are all equal and we have three of them, we can express the total amount of paint as:
   \[
   \text{Total paint} = \text{Red} + \text{White} + \text{Purple} + \text{Yellow}
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   12 = x + x + x + 6
   \]
   Simplifying this gives:
   \[
   12 = 3x + 6
   \]

5. **Solving for \( x \):**  
   To isolate \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides:
   \[
   12 - 6 = 3x
   \]
   \[
   6 = 3x

1. **Calculate the area of one bedroom**:
   Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet. So, the area of one bedroom is:
   \[
   \text{Area of one bedroom} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 20 \, \text{ft} \times 12 \, \text{ft} = 240 \, \text{sq ft}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total area of all four bedrooms**:
   Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area for all bedrooms is:
   \[
   \text{Total area of bedrooms} = 4 \times \text{Area of one bedroom} = 4 \times 240 \, \text{sq ft} = 960 \, \text{sq ft}
   \]

3. **Calculate the area of the living room**:
   The living room is said to be 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is:
   \[
   \text{Area of living room} = 5 \times \text{Area of one bedroom} = 5 \times 240 \, \text{sq ft} = 1200 \, \text{sq ft}
   \]

4. **Find the area of the rest of the house**:
   We are given that the rest of the house (which is not bedrooms or the living room) is 1000 square feet.

5. **Calculate the total area of the house**:
   Now, we add the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:
   \[
   \text{Total area of the house} = \text{Total area of bedrooms} + \text{Area of living room} + \text{Area of the rest of the house}
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Total area of the house} = 960 \, \text{sq ft} + 1200 \, \text{sq ft} + 1000 \, \text{sq ft} = 3160 \, \text{sq ft}

1. **Identify the number of clouds Alice sees each day**:
   - On Monday, Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.
   - Each subsequent day, the number of clouds is double the previous day's count.

2. **Calculate the number of clouds for each day**:
   - **Monday**: 3 clouds
   - **Tuesday**: Double Monday's count = 2 * 3 = 6 clouds
   - **Wednesday**: Double Tuesday's count = 2 * 6 = 12 clouds
   - **Thursday**: Double Wednesday's count = 2 * 12 = 24 clouds
   - **Friday**: Double Thursday's count = 2 * 24 = 48 clouds

3. **Now, let's summarize the counts**:
   - Monday: 3 clouds
   - Tuesday: 6 clouds
   - Wednesday: 12 clouds
   - Thursday: 24 clouds
   - Friday: 48 clouds

4. **Add up the total number of clouds counted across all five days**:
   - Total clouds = Monday + Tuesday + Wednesday + Thursday + Friday
   - Total clouds = 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48

5. **Perform the arithmetic**:
   - First, add 3 and 6: 3 + 6 = 9
   - Next, add 12: 9 + 12 = 21
   - Next, add 24: 21 + 24 = 45
   - Finally, add 48: 45 + 48 = 93

Thus, Alice counts a total of 93 clouds from Monday to Friday.

1. **Find the number of pods in the special size box**:
   - The regular box has 100 pods.
   - The special box has 20% more pods than the regular box.
   - We calculate 20% of 100: 
     \[ 20\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \]
   - Therefore, the special box has:
     \[ 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

2. **Determine the cost per pod**:
   - The cost of the special box is $12 for 120 pods.
   - To find the cost per pod, we divide the total cost by the number of pods:
     \[ \text{Cost per pod} = \frac{12}{120} = 0.1 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

3. **Calculate how many cycles can be run for $1**:
   - Since each cycle uses 1 pod, the number of cycles we can run for $1 is:
     \[ \text{Number of cycles for } 1 \text{ dollar} = \frac{1}{\text{Cost per pod}} = \frac{1}{0.1} = 10 \text{ cycles} \]

Putting all of this together, we find that with the new special box, you can run 10 dishwashing cycles for $1.

1. **Understanding the initial withdrawal**:
   - Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills.
   - To find out how many $20 bills he has, we divide $1000 by $20:
     \[
     \text{Number of $20 bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
     \]

2. **Considering the lost bills**:
   - Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home. 
   - The remaining number of $20 bills is:
     \[
     \text{Remaining $20 bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
     \]

3. **Paying for a bill**:
   - Thomas uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. 
   - Half of 40 bills is:
     \[
     \text{Bills used to pay} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
     \]
   - After paying, the number of $20 bills left is:
     \[
     \text{Remaining $20 bills after payment} = 40 - 20 = 20
     \]

4. **Tripling his money**:
   - Each $20 bill is worth $20, so the total amount of money he has after the payment is:
     \[
     \text{Remaining money} = 20 \times 20 = 400
     \]
   - Now, if Thomas triples this amount, he has:
     \[
     \text{Tripled amount} = 3 \times 400 = 1200

1. **Understanding the initial chalk usage**: The teacher starts with a new piece of chalk that is 5 inches long. He typically uses 20% of it each day, but on Monday, he used up 45%.

2. **Calculate the amount of chalk used on Monday**: 
   - 45% of 5 inches is calculated as follows:
   \[
   0.45 \times 5 = 2.25 \text{ inches}
   \]
   So, after Monday, the amount of chalk remaining is:
   \[
   5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Determine how many days the teacher can use the remaining chalk**: 
   - The teacher will now go back to using 20% of the chalk each day. We need to calculate 20% of the remaining 2.75 inches:
   \[
   0.20 \times 2.75 = 0.55 \text{ inches}
   \]
   This means the teacher uses 0.55 inches of chalk each day.

4. **Calculate how many days he can continue before reaching the threshold of 2 inches**: 
   - The teacher can continue using the chalk until it reaches 2 inches. The remaining chalk is currently 2.75 inches, so we need to find out how much chalk he can use before it gets to 2 inches:
   \[
   2.75 - 2 = 0.75 \text{ inches}
   \]
   Now, we can determine how many days he can use 0.55 inches of chalk before it drops below 2 inches:
   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{0.75}{0.55} \approx 1.3636
   \]
   Since the teacher cannot use chalk for a fraction of a day, he can only use it for 1 full day before reaching the threshold of 2 inches.

5. **Conclusion**: After Monday's usage, the teacher has enough chalk to continue for 1 additional day before reaching the point where he must recycle it.

gsm8k,gsm8k-1181,SA,1,"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( c \) and Wendy's current age as \( w \).

### Step 1: Set up the equations based on the problem statement.

1. **From the first statement**: ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.""
   - In seven years, Colin's age will be \( c + 7 \).
   - Therefore, the equation based on this statement is:
     \[
     w = 5(c + 7)
     \]

2. **From the second statement**: ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.""
   - In 25 years, Colin's age will be \( c + 25 \).
   - Wendy's current age is \( w \).
   - Therefore, the equation based on this statement is:
     \[
     c + 25 = \frac{1}{3}w
     \]

### Step 2: Substitute and solve the equations.

We now have two equations:
1. \( w = 5(c + 7) \)
2. \( c + 25 = \frac{1}{3}w \)

Let's substitute the expression for \( w \) from the first equation into the second equation.

Substituting \( w \):
\[
c + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5(c + 7))
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the equation.

Calculating the right-hand side:
\[
c + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(c + 7)
\]

Now, distribute \( \frac{5}{3} \):
\[
c + 25 = \frac{5}{3}c + \frac{35}{3}
\]

### Step 4: Eliminate the fraction.

To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 3:
\[
3(c + 25) = 5c + 35
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
3c + 75 = 5c + 35
\]

### Step 5: Rearrange and solve for \( c \).

Rearranging the equation:
\[
3c + 75 - 35 = 5c
\]
\[
3c + 40 = 5c
\]
\[
40 = 5c - 3c
\]
\[
40 = 2c
\]
Dividing both sides by 2:
\[
c = 20

1. **Determine the total number of pizza slices needed:**
   - Kate has 6 friends, and each friend eats:
     - 6 slices of cheese pizza
     - 4 slices of pepperoni pizza
   - Therefore, the total slices per friend = 6 (cheese) + 4 (pepperoni) = 10 slices.
   - Since there are 6 friends, the total slices needed for all friends = 6 friends * 10 slices per friend = 60 slices.

2. **Calculate the number of cheese pizza pies needed:**
   - Each cheese pizza has 12 slices.
   - To find out how many cheese pizzas are needed for 60 slices, we divide the total slices by the slices per pizza:
     - Number of cheese pizzas needed = 60 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 5 pizzas.

3. **Calculate the number of pepperoni pizza pies needed:**
   - Each pepperoni pizza has 8 slices.
   - To find out how many pepperoni pizzas are needed for the same 60 slices, we divide the total slices by the slices per pizza:
     - Number of pepperoni pizzas needed = 60 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 7.5 pizzas.
   - Since we cannot buy half a pizza, we will need to round up to the nearest whole pizza. Thus, Kate needs 8 pepperoni pizzas.

   - Since there are 4 segments of 15 minutes in an hour, the total net number of snowballs built in an hour is:
     \[
     3 \text{ (net per 15 minutes)} \times 4 = 12 \text{ snowballs}
     \]

3. **Determine how long it takes to build 60 snowballs:**
   - We need to find out how many hours it takes to reach 60 snowballs at a rate of 12 snowballs per hour:
     \[
     \text{Time in hours} = \frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{12 \text{ snowballs/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}

1. **Identify John's current age**: John is currently 28 years old.

2. **Determine the time since the Digimon release**: Since Digimon had its 20th anniversary, it means it has been 20 years since its release.

3. **Calculate John's age at the time of Digimon's release**: 
   - Since Digimon has been around for 20 years, we can find out how old John was when it came out by subtracting 20 from his current age:
   - John's age at the time of release = 28 - 20 = 8 years old.

4. **Relationship between John's and Jim's ages at that time**: According to the problem, when Digimon was released, John was twice as old as Jim. 
   - Let Jim's age at that time be represented as J.
   - According to the relationship given: 8 = 2J.

5. **Solve for Jim's age**: 
   - To find Jim's age when Digimon was released, we can rearrange the equation:
   - J = 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

6. **Calculate Jim's current age**: Since it has been 20 years since the release, we add 20 years to Jim's age at the time of the release:
   - Jim's current age = 4 + 20 = 24 years old.

   The total number of shells discovered is 700.

2. **Calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas**:
   Team Alphas found 40% of the shells.
   To find this, we can calculate:
   \[
   \text{Shells found by Alphas} = 700 \times 0.40 = 280
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining shells after team Alphas**:
   After team Alphas has taken their share, the remaining shells can be calculated by subtracting the number of shells found by Alphas from the total:
   \[
   \text{Remaining shells} = 700 - 280 = 420
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of shells found by team The finders**:
   Team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells. We can calculate this as follows:
   \[
   \text{Shells found by The finders} = 420 \times 0.60 = 252
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of shells found by team Gogetters**:
   To find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we need to subtract the shells found by both teams Alphas and The finders from the total:
   \[
   \text{Shells found by Gogetters} = 700 - (280 + 252)
   \]
   First, calculate the sum of the shells found by Alphas and The finders:
   \[
   280 + 252 = 532
   \]
   Now, subtract this from the total:
   \[
   \text{Shells found by Gogetters} = 700 - 532 = 168
   \]

6. **Final Answer**:
   Therefore, the number of shells found by team Gogetters is:

gsm8k,gsm8k-1205,SA,1,"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the known distances**: 
   - First dog: 1 mile
   - Second dog: 4 miles
   - Third dog: 3 miles
   - Fourth dog: unknown (let's call it \( x \))

2. **Calculate the average distance**: 
   We know that the average distance needed by the four dogs is 3 miles. The average is calculated by dividing the total distance by the number of dogs. 

   The formula for average is:
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Number of dogs}}
   \]

   In this case, we have 4 dogs, and the average is given as 3 miles. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   3 = \frac{(1 + 4 + 3 + x)}{4}
   \]

3. **Solve for the total distance**: 
   To find the total distance, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4:
   \[
   3 \times 4 = 1 + 4 + 3 + x
   \]
   \[
   12 = 1 + 4 + 3 + x
   \]

4. **Combine the known distances**: 
   Now, add the known distances:
   \[
   1 + 4 + 3 = 8
   \]

5. **Substitute back into the equation**: 
   Now, we can substitute this back into the equation:
   \[
   12 = 8 + x
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   To find \( x \), subtract 8 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 12 - 8
   \]
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

The last dog needs to walk 4 miles.

1. **Determine the amount of the loan**:  
   John gets a loan worth 40% of his house's value.  
   His house is worth $250,000.  
   To find the loan amount:  
   Loan amount = 40% of $250,000  
   = 0.40 * 250,000  
   = $100,000.

2. **Calculate how much he uses to pay off debts**:  
   John uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts.  
   To find the amount used to pay debts:  
   Amount for debts = 60% of $100,000  
   = 0.60 * 100,000  
   = $60,000.

3. **Calculate how much money John has left after paying debts**:

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   The jar has a square base of 6 inches by 6 inches and a height of 15 inches.
   - Volume of the jar = base area × height
   - Base area = 6 inches × 6 inches = 36 square inches
   - Height = 15 inches
   - Volume of the jar = 36 square inches × 15 inches = 540 cubic inches

2. **Calculate the effective volume available for jelly beans:**
   Since the packing efficiency is 80%, we need to find 80% of the total volume.
   - Effective volume = Total volume × Packing efficiency
   - Effective volume = 540 cubic inches × 0.80 = 432 cubic inches

3. **Determine how many jelly beans can fit in the effective volume:**
   Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches.
   - Number of jelly beans = Effective volume / Volume per jelly bean
   - Number of jelly beans = 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches per jelly bean
   - Number of jelly beans = 2880 jelly beans

gsm8k,gsm8k-1223,SA,1,"To determine the cost of a 36-minute call from a payphone, we need to consider the pricing structure given in the problem.

1. **Break down the reasoning:**
   - The first 16 minutes of the call are charged at $0.25 per minute.
   - After the first 16 minutes, the rate drops to $0.20 per minute for the remaining time.
   - We need to calculate the cost for the first 16 minutes and then the cost for the remaining time (which is 36 - 16 = 20 minutes).

2. **Perform the arithmetic carefully:**
   - **Cost for the first 16 minutes:**
     \[
     \text{Cost for first 16 minutes} = 16 \text{ minutes} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/minute} = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]

   - **Cost for the remaining 20 minutes:**
     \[
     \text{Cost for remaining 20 minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars/minute} = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]

   - **Total cost of the call:**
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost for first 16 minutes} + \text{Cost for remaining 20 minutes} = 4 \text{ dollars} + 4 \text{ dollars} = 8 \text{ dollars}

1. **Determine the total number of treats needed**: 
   Carly's class has 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats. Therefore, the total number of treats is:
   \[
   5 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ treats/person} = 10 \text{ treats}
   \]

2. **Set up variables for the number of cupcakes and brownies**:
   Let \( c \) represent the number of cupcakes Carly makes. According to the problem, she makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. We can express the number of brownies \( b \) as:
   \[
   b = 3c - 2
   \]

3. **Write an equation for the total number of treats**:
   The total number of treats (cupcakes + brownies) must equal 10. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   c + b = 10
   \]
   Substituting the expression for \( b \) into the equation gives:
   \[
   c + (3c - 2) = 10
   \]

4. **Simplify and solve for \( c \)**:
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   c + 3c - 2 = 10
   \]
   \[
   4c - 2 = 10
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   4c = 12
   \]
   Divide by 4:
   \[
   c = 3
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of brownies**:
   Now we can find \( b \) using the value of \( c \):
   \[
   b = 3c - 2 = 3(3) - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7
   \]

6. **Verify the total number of treats**:
   Finally, check if the total number of treats is correct:

1. We know that Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. If we denote the number of paintings Samantha has as S and the number of paintings Shelley has as H, we can write the equation:
   \[
   S = H - 12
   \]

2. We also know that Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim. If we denote the number of paintings Kim has as K, we can write another equation:
   \[
   H = K + 8
   \]

3. We are given that Samantha has 27 paintings. So, we can substitute this value into the first equation:
   \[
   27 = H - 12
   \]

4. Now, we can solve for H (the number of paintings Shelley has):
   \[
   H = 27 + 12
   \]
   \[
   H = 39
   \]

5. Now that we know Shelley has 39 paintings, we can use the second equation to find out how many paintings Kim has:
   \[
   H = K + 8
   \]
   Substituting H with 39:
   \[
   39 = K + 8

1. **Initial Price in November**: The toy costs $40.

2. **Price Increase in December**: The price increased by 80%. To find the new price after the increase, we need to calculate 80% of $40 and then add that to the original price.

   - Calculate 80% of $40:
     \[
     0.80 \times 40 = 32
     \]
   - Add this increase to the original price:
     \[

1. **Calculate the total time needed to clean all classrooms**:
   - The custodian has to clean 80 classrooms.
   - It takes 15 minutes to clean each classroom.
   - Therefore, the total time needed in minutes is:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Convert the total time into hours**:
   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total minutes into hours:
     \[
     \text{Total time in hours} = \frac{1200 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 20 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Determine the total number of working hours over 5 days**:
   - The custodian works for 8 hours each day for 5 days. Therefore, the total working hours are:
     \[
     \text{Total working hours} = 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 40 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms**:
   - The percentage of time spent cleaning can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Percentage of time spent cleaning} = \left( \frac{\text{Total cleaning hours}}{\text{Total working hours}} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - Substituting the values we found:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{40 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\%
     \]

Therefore, the custodian spends 50% of their working day cleaning classrooms.

1. **Identify the capacity of each shelf:**
   - Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books.
   - Therefore, the capacity of the middle shelves is:
     \[
     2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ books}
     \]

   - The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, which means:
     \[
     2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ books}
     \]

   - The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf:
     \[
     20 - 5 = 15 \text{ books}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total capacity of one bookcase:**
   - We can now find the total capacity of one bookcase by adding the capacity of all the shelves together:
     \[
     \text{Total capacity} = \text{Middle shelves} + \text{Bottom shelf} + \text{Top shelf}
     \]
     \[
     = 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 \text{ books}
     \]

3. **Determine how many bookcases Elly needs:**
   - Elly has a total of 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:
     \[
     \text{Number of bookcases} = \frac{110}{55} = 2
     \]

Since she can't have a fraction of a bookcase, we round up if necessary, but in this case, 110 is exactly divisible by 55.

Therefore, Elly needs exactly 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

     \]
   - The cost per dozen is $2.40, so the total cost for five dozens is:
     \[
     5 \text{ dozens} \times 2.40 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 12.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs:**
   - Rose sells the eggs at $1 for 3 eggs. First, we need to determine how many groups of 3 eggs are in 60 eggs:
     \[
     60 \text{ eggs} \div 3 \text{ eggs/group} = 20 \text{ groups}
     \]
   - Since she sells each group for $1, the total revenue from selling all the eggs is:
     \[
     20 \text{ groups} \times 1 \text{ dollar/group} = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate Rose's profit:**
   - Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost:

gsm8k,gsm8k-1245,SA,1,"To solve the problem, we will use algebra to represent the number of ice cubes Mary makes.

1. Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \).
2. According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes \( B \) is equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. We can express this as:
   \[
   B = 5S - 4
   \]
3. We know that the total number of ice cubes (strawberry and blueberry combined) is 116. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   S + B = 116
   \]
4. Now, we can substitute the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:
   \[
   S + (5S - 4) = 116
   \]
5. Simplifying this equation:
   \[
   S + 5S - 4 = 116
   \]
   \[
   6S - 4 = 116
   \]
6. Now, let's add 4 to both sides of the equation:
   \[
   6S = 116 + 4
   \]
   \[
   6S = 120
   \]
7. Next, we divide both sides by 6 to find \( S \):
   \[
   S = \frac{120}{6} = 20
   \]
8. Now that we have the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes using the first equation:
   \[
   B = 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4
   \]
   \[
   B = 100 - 4 = 96

1. **Break Down the Distance**:
   - Total distance to home = 200 yards.
   - Half of the distance on land = 200 yards / 2 = 100 yards.
   - Half of the distance in water = 200 yards / 2 = 100 yards.

2. **Determine the Speeds**:
   - Speed on land = 20 yards per minute.
   - Speed in water = 10 yards per minute.

3. **Calculate the Time Taken for Each Segment**:
   - Time to hop on land (for 100 yards):
     \[
     \text{Time on land} = \frac{\text{Distance on land}}{\text{Speed on land}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}.
     \]
   - Time to swim in water (for 100 yards):
     \[
     \text{Time in water} = \frac{\text{Distance in water}}{\text{Speed in water}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards/minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes}.
     \]

4. **Total Time to Return Home**:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Time on land} + \text{Time in water} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes}.
   \]

Thus, the total time Phineas takes to return home is 15 minutes.

1. **Day 1**: Conor saw 50 people at the beach.

2. **Day 2**: The problem states that there were 20 more people than on the first day.
   - Number of people on Day 2 = Number of people on Day 1 + 20
   - Number of people on Day 2 = 50 + 20 = 70

3. **Day 3**: The total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on Day 2.
   - Number of people on Day 3 = 2 × Number of people on Day 2
   - Number of people on Day 3 = 2 × 70 = 140

4. **Average for the rest of the week**: Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining days of the week. Since a week has 7 days, we need to calculate the number of days left after Day 3.
   - Total days in a week = 7
   - Days accounted for (Day 1, Day 2, Day 3) = 3
   - Days remaining = 7 - 3 = 4

5. **People seen in the remaining days**: Since he saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining 4 days:
   - Total people seen in the remaining days = Average number of people × Number of remaining days
   - Total people seen in the remaining days = 60 × 4 = 240

6. **Total people seen during the week**: Now we add the number of people seen each day to find the total for the week.
   - Total for the week = People on Day 1 + People on Day 2 + People on Day 3 + People over the remaining days
   - Total for the week = 50 + 70 + 140 + 240

7. **Perform the final arithmetic**:
   - Total for the week = 50 + 70 = 120
   - Total for the week = 120 + 140 = 260

1. **First 30 Seconds:**
   - Number of kernels popped = 20.

2. **Next 30 Seconds:**
   - Number of kernels popped = 3 times the previous amount.
   - Therefore, kernels popped = 3 * 20 = 60.

3. **Next 30 Seconds:**
   - Popping rate increases to 4 times the initial rate.
   - The initial rate was 20, so now it is 4 * 20 = 80.
   - Kernels popped in this interval = 80.

4. **Final 30 Seconds:**
   - Popping slows down to half the rate of the last 30 seconds.
   - The last rate was 80, so half of that is 80 / 2 = 40.
   - Kernels popped in this interval = 40.

5. **Total Kernels Popped:**
   - Now we add all the kernels popped in each interval:
     - First 30 seconds: 20
     - Next 30 seconds: 60
     - Next 30 seconds: 80
     - Final 30 seconds: 40

6. **Kernels Popped from Residual Heat:**
   - A quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop due to residual heat.
   - Kernels popped in the final 30 seconds = 40.
   - Therefore, kernels popped from residual heat = 40 / 4 = 10.

7. **Grand Total of Kernels:**

     \]

3. **Calculate the lemon juice needed for the extra tart lemonade**:
   - For Allen's extra gallon, which is twice as tart, Tim will use 2 cups of lemon juice (since it's twice the amount for one gallon).
   - Therefore, the total lemon juice needed for all 5 gallons is:
     \[
     4 \text{ cups} + 2 \text{ cups} = 6 \text{ cups of lemon juice}
     \]

4. **Determine how many lemons are required**:
   - Tim found out that 6 lemons yield 1 cup of lemon juice.
   - To find out how many lemons are needed for 6 cups, we can set up the ratio:
     \[
     \text{Lemons needed} = 6 \text{ lemons/cup} \times 6 \text{ cups} = 36 \text{ lemons}

     - Cost of one bus trip = 10% × $80 = 0.10 × $80 = $8.
   - Now, calculate the total cost for 7 bus trips:
     - Total bus cost = Number of trips × Cost per trip = 7 trips × $8 = $56.

3. **Calculate the total cost for the trip:**
   - Total cost = Total hotel cost + Total bus cost = $240 + $56 = $296.

Now that we have performed all the calculations, we can summarize the final answer.

1. **Understanding the situation**: Mazie has 52 marbles in total, and she gives some to Dallas and some to Darla. 

2. **Dallas's marbles**: We know that Dallas has 21 marbles after dropping 4 of them. This means he originally had more marbles before dropping any.

3. **Calculating Dallas's original amount**: 
   - If Dallas has 21 marbles after dropping 4, we can find out how many he had before by adding the 4 marbles he dropped:
   
   \[
   \text{Original number of Dallas's marbles} = 21 + 4 = 25
   \]

4. **Total marbles distributed**: Since Mazie gave a total of 52 marbles to both twins, we can now find out how many marbles Darla received by subtracting the number of marbles Dallas received from the total number of marbles:
   
   \[
   \text{Marbles given to Darla} = 52 - \text{Number of marbles Dallas received}
   \]
   - We just calculated that Dallas received 25 marbles. So:
   
   \[
   \text{Marbles given to Darla} = 52 - 25 = 27
   \]

5. **Final answer**: We have determined that Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla.

1. **Determine the number of tickets needed**:
   - The family consists of two parents and one child.
   - This means they need 2 adult tickets and 1 child ticket.

2. **Calculate the cost of the tickets**:
   - The cost of one adult ticket is $12.
   - Therefore, for 2 adult tickets:  
     2 adult tickets × $12/adult ticket = $24.
   - The cost of one child ticket is $8.
   - Thus, for 1 child ticket:  
     1 child ticket × $8/child ticket = $8.

3. **Total cost of the tickets**:

- The original price of each T-shirt is $8.
- Jake buys 2 T-shirts.
- Under the buy one get one 50% off deal:
  - The first T-shirt costs $8.
  - The second T-shirt (which is 50% off) costs \( 50\% \times 8 = 0.5 \times 8 = 4 \).

Now let's calculate the total cost for the T-shirts:
- Total cost for T-shirts = Price of first T-shirt + Price of second T-shirt

   - Petri dishes: Igor gathered two more than the requested 14, which is \( 14 + 2 = 16 \).

3. **Calculate the total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench:**
   - Total items collected by Igor = Test tubes + Beakers + Petri dishes
   - Total items = 8 (test tubes) + 7 (beakers) + 16 (Petri dishes)
   - Total items = 8 + 7 + 16 = 31

4. **Compare the total items Igor placed with the total items Dr. Grumpus wanted:**
   - Dr. Grumpus wanted 16 (test tubes) + 7 (beakers) + 14 (Petri dishes) = 37 items in total.
   - Igor placed 29 items on the lab bench.

5. **Determine how many beakers Igor lost:**
   - The difference between the total items Igor gathered (31) and the total items he placed (29) is:
   - Items lost = 31 - 29 = 2.
   - Since he gathered the correct number of beakers (7), but lost some, we can find out how many he lost:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of beakers Igor lost. Thus, the equation becomes:
   - 7 (original beakers) - \( x \) (lost beakers) = 29 (total items he placed) - (test tubes + Petri dishes)
   - We already calculated test tubes and Petri dishes: 8 (test tubes) + 16 (Petri dishes) = 24.
   - Therefore, the equation becomes:
   - 7 - \( x \) = 29 - 24

gsm8k,gsm8k-1310,SA,1,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the Speed Relationship**:
   - We know that Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa. This means if Vanessa's speed is \( v \), then Aaron's speed is \( 2v \).

2. **Understanding the Distance Relationship**:
   - We are told that Vanessa is able to run twice as far as Aaron. If we let the distance Aaron ran be \( d_a \), then the distance Vanessa ran is \( 2d_a \).

3. **Given Information**:
   - We know that Vanessa ran 4 miles. Therefore, according to our distance relationship:
     \[
     2d_a = 4 \implies d_a = 2 \text{ miles}
     \]
   - This means Aaron ran 2 miles.

4. **Calculating Aaron's Speed**:
   - We know that Aaron completed his part of the race (2 miles) in 16 minutes. 
   - To find Aaron's speed, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Speed of Aaron} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{8} \text{ miles per minute}
     \]

5. **Finding Vanessa's Speed**:
   - Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, we can find Vanessa's speed:
     \[
     \text{Speed of Vanessa} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \text{Speed of Aaron} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{8} \text{ miles per minute} = \frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute}
     \]

6. **Calculating the Time Vanessa Took**:
   - Now we need to find out how long it took Vanessa to run 4 miles at her speed of \( \frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute} \):
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{\frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute}} = 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ minutes}
     \]

gsm8k,gsm8k-1317,SA,1,"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( C \) be the number of chickens.
   - Let \( W \) be the number of cows.

2. **Set Up Equations**:
   - We know that the total number of animals is 20:
     \[
     C + W = 20
     \]
   - We also know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. The total number of legs is 70:
     \[
     2C + 4W = 70
     \]

3. **Simplify the Second Equation**:
   - We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
     \[
     C + 2W = 35
     \]

4. **Now we have a system of equations**:
   - From the first equation: 
     \[
     C + W = 20 \quad \text{(1)}
     \]
   - From the simplified second equation:
     \[
     C + 2W = 35 \quad \text{(2)}
     \]

5. **Subtract Equation (1) from Equation (2)**:
   \[
   (C + 2W) - (C + W) = 35 - 20
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   W = 15
   \]

6. **Substitute \( W \) back into Equation (1)**:
   \[
   C + 15 = 20
   \]
   Solving for \( C \) gives:
   \[
   C = 20 - 15 = 5
