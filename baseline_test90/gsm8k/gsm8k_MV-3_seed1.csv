**Given information:**
- First five test scores: 89, 71, 92, 100, 86
- Mr. Bert drops the lowest score before calculating the average
- Target average: 93
- Need to find: score on the sixth test

**Step-by-step solution:**

Let me call the sixth test score **x**.

First, I need to consider two scenarios since I don't know if x will be the lowest score or not.

**Current scores:** 89, 71, 92, 100, 86

The current lowest score is **71**.

**Scenario 1: The sixth test score (x) is NOT the lowest score**

If x ≥ 71, then 71 will be dropped, and the average will be calculated from: 89, 92, 100, 86, and x.

Average = (89 + 92 + 100 + 86 + x) / 5 = 93

(367 + x) / 5 = 93

367 + x = 465

x = 98

Let me verify: 98 ≥ 71 ✓ (so our assumption holds)

Average = (89 + 92 + 100 + 86 + 98) / 5 = 465 / 5 = 93 ✓

**Scenario 2: The sixth test score (x) IS the lowest score**

If x < 71, then x would be dropped, and the average would be calculated from: 89, 71, 92, 100, 86.

Average = (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86) / 5 = 438 / 5 = 87.6

This is less than 93, so this scenario won't work.

gsm8k,gsm8k-206,MV-3,1,"Let me help you calculate the total kilometers Michael rode on his bike. I'll break it down step by step for clarity.

### Step 1: Calculate the distance for the first period
- Michael rode the bike at least 5 times a week, which we'll take as exactly 5 times (based on the problem's context).
- Each ride was 25 kilometers.
- So, per week: 5 rides × 25 km/ride = 125 km.
- He did this for 4 weeks: 125 km/week × 4 weeks = 500 km.

### Step 2: Calculate the distance for the second period
- Michael then rode the bike 2 times a week.
- Each ride was 60 kilometers.
- So, per week: 2 rides × 60 km/ride = 120 km.
- He did this for 3 weeks: 120 km/week × 3 weeks = 360 km.

### Step 3: Add the distances from both periods
- Total distance: 500 km (first period) + 360 km (second period) = 860 km.

   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Therefore, the total cost of half a dozen plates is:

gsm8k,gsm8k-211,MV-3,1,"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \).

From the problem, we know the following:

1. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, so the total egg production from red chickens is \( 3r \).
2. The white chickens produce 5 eggs a day, so the total egg production from white chickens is \( 5w \).
3. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs a day, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   3r + 5w = 42
   \]
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which gives us the equation:
   \[
   w = r + 2
   \]

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation. Replacing \( w \) in the first equation gives us:
\[
3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
\]

Now, let's simplify this equation:
\[
3r + 5r + 10 = 42
\]
\[
8r + 10 = 42
\]

Next, we isolate \( r \):
\[
8r = 42 - 10
\]
\[
8r = 32
\]
\[
r = \frac{32}{8}
\]
\[
r = 4
\]

Now that we have the number of red chickens, we can find the number of white chickens:
\[
w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6
\]

Thus, Jerry has:
- **4 red chickens**
- **6 white chickens**

To verify, we can check the total egg production:
- Eggs from red chickens: \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \)
- Eggs from white chickens: \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \)
- Total eggs: \( 12 + 30 = 42 \)

Let me define variables:
- Let S = amount of water in the small pool now (in gallons)
- Let B = amount of water in the big pool now (in gallons)

**Setting up equations from the given information:**

**Current situation (now):**
- The big pool has four times as much water as the small pool
- B = 4S

**Situation 4 minutes ago:**
- Both pools have been leaking at 4 gallons/minute for 4 minutes
- So each pool has lost: 4 gallons/minute × 4 minutes = 16 gallons
- 4 minutes ago, small pool had: S + 16 gallons
- 4 minutes ago, big pool had: B + 16 gallons
- At that time, the big pool had twice as much as the small pool
- B + 16 = 2(S + 16)

**Solving the system of equations:**

From equation 2:
B + 16 = 2(S + 16)
B + 16 = 2S + 32
B = 2S + 16

Now I have two expressions for B:
- B = 4S (from current situation)
- B = 2S + 16 (from 4 minutes ago)

Setting them equal:
4S = 2S + 16
2S = 16
S = 8

**Verification:**
- Small pool now: S = 8 gallons
- Big pool now: B = 4S = 32 gallons
- Small pool 4 minutes ago: 8 + 16 = 24 gallons
- Big pool 4 minutes ago: 32 + 16 = 48 gallons

4. **Calculate the percentage of water type cards:**
   \[

1. **Determine the number of pen pals Mike has now:**
   - Initially, Mike had 5 pen pals.
   - He stopped being pen pals with 2 of them.
   - Therefore, the number of pen pals he has now is:
     \[
     5 - 2 = 3

2. **Calculate the total number of letters received per week:**
   - Each pen pal sends 2 letters a week.
   - With 3 pen pals, the total number of letters received per week is:
     \[
     3 \text{ pen pals} \times 2 \text{ letters/pen pal} = 6 \text{ letters}

3. **Determine the total number of pages he receives per week:**
   - Each letter is 5 pages long.
   - Therefore, the total number of pages received per week is:

### Step 1: Calculate the total hours of work
- The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
- Each session takes 6 hours.
- Sessions are needed 4 times a week.
- The movie lasts for 5 weeks.

First, find the hours per week:  
4 sessions/week × 6 hours/session = 24 hours/week

Then, for the entire movie:  
24 hours/week × 5 weeks = 120 hours

So, the total hours worked is 120 hours.

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost before discount
- Hourly rate: $250/hour
- Total hours: 120 hours

Total cost = 120 hours × $250/hour = $30,000

### Step 3: Apply the 10% discount
- The makeup artist gives a 10% discount on the total amount after the movie is finished.
- 10% of $30,000 = 0.10 × $30,000 = $3,000
- Discounted total = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

### Step 1: Identify the known values
- The body of the sweater requires **900 stitches**.
- The collar requires **a tenth of the body's stitches**:  
  \( 900 \div 10 = 90 \) stitches.
- The rosette requires **twice as many stitches as the collar**:

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9.

Now, let's summarize the points after the first three rounds:
- Mike: 21 points
- Jim: 18 points
- Tony: 42 points

Next, we need to determine if each player gets an extra point in the fourth round. The rule states that every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points.

- **Mike**: 21 points (over 20, so he gets 1 extra point)
- **Jim**: 18 points (not over 20, so he does not get an extra point)

  - Squats: 50
  - Dumbbell presses: 20
  - Total for Day 1: 100 + 50 + 20 = 170 activities

- **Day 2:**
  - Pushups: 20 more than Day 1, so 100 + 20 = 120
  - Squats: 10 fewer than Day 1, so 50 - 10 = 40
  - Dumbbell presses: Doubles the amount from Day 1, so 20 × 2 = 40
  - Total for Day 2: 120 + 40 + 40 = 200 activities

### Step 2: Calculate the total activities over two days
- Total pushups: Day 1 (100) + Day 2 (120) = 220
- Total squats: Day 1 (50) + Day 2 (40) = 90
- Total dumbbell presses: Day 1 (20) + Day 2 (40) = 60

### Step 1: Calculate rice consumption per person per day
- Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal.
- There are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner).
- Therefore, rice consumed per person per day = 0.2 kg/meal × 2 meals/day = 0.4 kg/day.

### Step 2: Calculate total rice consumption for the household per day
- There are 5 members in the household.
- Total rice consumed per day = 0.4 kg/person/day × 5 people = 2 kg/day.

### Step 3: Determine how many days the 42 kg bag will last
- The bag contains 42 kg of rice.
- Daily consumption is 2 kg.
- Number of days the bag will last = Total rice ÷ Daily consumption = 42 kg ÷ 2 kg/day = 21 days.

### Step 4: Convert days to weeks
- There are 7 days in a week.

1. **Determine the number of books sold this year:**
   - This year, Elise sold 45 books.

2. **Determine the number of books sold in the first year:**
   - According to the problem, she sold twice as many books in the first year as she sold this year.
   - Therefore, the number of books sold in the first year = \( 2 \times 45 = 90 \) books.

3. **Determine the total number of books sold over the three years:**
   - The total number of books in the collection is 250.
   - Currently, there are 50 unsold books.
   - Therefore, the total number of books sold = \( 250 - 50 = 200 \) books.

4. **Determine the number of books sold in the second year:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of books sold in the second year.
   - The total number of books sold over the three years can be expressed as:
     \[
     90 \text{ (first year)} + x \text{ (second year)} + 45 \text{ (third year)} = 200
     \]
   - Simplifying this equation:

### Step 1: Determine Noah's current age
- Cera is currently 46 years old.
- Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
- At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(\frac{40}{2} = 20\) years old six years ago.
- Therefore, Noah's current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years.

### Step 2: Calculate the population of Chile six years ago
- Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old.

- There are twice as many players on the offense as on the defense.
- There are half as many players on the special teams as on the defense.

Let \( D \) represent the number of players on the defense.

From the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{1}{2}D \).

The total number of players is 105, so we can write the equation:
\[
2D + D + \frac{1}{2}D = 105
\]

Combine the terms:
\[
2D + D + 0.5D = 3.5D
\]
\[
3.5D = 105

Solve for \( D \):
\[
D = \frac{105}{3.5} = 30

gsm8k,gsm8k-316,MV-3,1,"To calculate the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of marbles Solomon bought from Johanna:**
   Solomon bought 20 marbles.

2. **Calculate the initial number of marbles in the store:**
   The store initially had 50 marbles.

3. **Calculate the total number of marbles after Solomon's purchase:**
   \[
   \text{Total marbles after purchase} = \text{Initial marbles} + \text{Marbles bought from Johanna} = 50 + 20 = 70

4. **Calculate the number of marbles Solomon's father gave him:**
   Solomon's father gave him \( \frac{2}{5} \) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna:
   \[
   \text{Marbles from father} = \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of marbles after receiving from his father:**
   \[

6. **Calculate the total weight of the marbles:**
   Each marble weighs 2 kg, so the total weight is:
   \[

gsm8k,gsm8k-326,MV-3,1,"Let me reason through this problem step by step to determine how many people got on the bus at the terminal.

### Step 1: Define the unknown
- Let \( X \) be the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal.

### Step 2: Account for the changes at each stop
- At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on. So, the total number of people is now \( X + 5 \).
- At the second bus stop:
  - 7 people got down, so subtract 7: \( (X + 5) - 7 \).
  - Then, 8 more people got on, so add 8: \( [(X + 5) - 7] + 8 \).

### Step 3: Set up the equation
- After these changes, there are 20 people heading to the third stop. So:
  \[
  [(X + 5) - 7] + 8 = 20
  \]

### Step 4: Simplify the equation
- First, simplify inside the brackets:
  \[
  X + 5 - 7 + 8 = 20
  \]
- Combine the constants:
  \[
  5 - 7 + 8 = 6
  \]
- So the equation becomes:
  \[
  X + 6 = 20
  \]

### Step 5: Solve for \( X \)
- Subtract 6 from both sides:
  \[
  X = 20 - 6
  \]
  \[
  X = 14
  \]

### Step 6: Verify the solution
- Start with 14 people at the terminal.
- After the first stop: 14 + 5 = 19 people.
- After the second stop: 19 - 7 = 12, then 12 + 8 = 20 people.
- This matches the given information that there are 20 people heading to the third stop.

### Step 1: Understand the problem
- Farmer Brown has a total of 60 animals, which are either chickens or cows.
- He has twice as many chickens as cows.
- Chickens have 2 legs each.
- Cows have 4 legs each.
- We need to find the total number of legs for all the animals.

### Step 2: Define the variables
- Let \( c \) represent the number of cows.
- Then, the number of chickens is \( 2c \) (since there are twice as many chickens as cows).

### Step 3: Set up the equation for total animals
- The total number of animals is 60, so:
  \[
  c + 2c = 60
  \]
- Simplify the equation:
  \[
  3c = 60
  \]
- Solve for \( c \):

  - Number of chickens = \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \)

- Annual interest rate = 10%, so the monthly interest rate \( r = \frac{10\%}{12} = \frac{0.10}{12} \approx 0.008333 \)
- \( n = 5 \)

Now, substituting the values into the formula:

1. Calculate \( r \):
   \[
   r = \frac{0.10}{12} \approx 0.008333
   \]

2. Substitute \( P \), \( r \), and \( n \) into the formula:
   \[
   M = \frac{3650 \times 0.008333}{1 - (1 + 0.008333)^{-5}}
   \]

3. Calculate \( (1 + r)^{-n} \):
   \[
   (1 + 0.008333)^{-5} \approx (1.008333)^{-5} \approx 0.958
   \]
   So,
   \[
   1 - (1 + 0.008333)^{-5} \approx 1 - 0.958 \approx 0.042
   \]

4. Now calculate \( M \):
   \[
   M = \frac{3650 \times 0.008333}{0.042} \approx \frac{30.416}{0.042} \approx 724.76

From the problem, we know:
- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- She gathers half of that amount from the shortest trees, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
- Therefore, the total number of apples Joanne gathers is:
  \[
  30 + 15 + x = 45 + x
  \]

Now, let's analyze her sister's gathering:
- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- She gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- She does not gather any apples from the average trees.

Thus, the total number of apples her sister gathers is:
\[
60 + 45 = 105
\]

Now, we can set up the equation for the combined total of apples gathered by both sisters:
\[
(45 + x) + 105 = 500
\]

Simplifying this equation:
\[
45 + x + 105 = 500

\[
x + 150 = 500

\[
x = 500 - 150

### Step 1: Calculate the distance for the first 4 days
- Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day for the first 4 days.
- Distance: 4 days × 200 km/day = 800 km

### Step 2: Calculate the distance for the next 2 days
- The distance traveled over these 2 days is 30% of the distance from the first 4 days.
- Distance from the first 4 days: 800 km
- 30% of 800 km: 0.30 × 800 km = 240 km
- So, total distance for the next 2 days: 240 km

### Step 3: Calculate the distance for the next day
- Tom wasn't traveling at all on this day.
- Distance: 0 km

### Step 4: Calculate the distance for the second week
- The second week consists of the remaining days. A two-week trip is 14 days, and we've already accounted for 7 days (4 + 2 + 1).
- So, the second week is 7 days.
- Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day during the second week.
- Distance: 7 days × 300 km/day = 2100 km

### Step 5: Calculate the total distance
- Add up all the distances:
  - First 4 days: 800 km
  - Next 2 days: 240 km
  - Next 1 day: 0 km
  - Second week: 2100 km
- Total: 800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

The total amount spent is \(120 + 75c\) cents, and the amount left is \(500 - (120 + 75c)\) cents. According to the problem, the amount left is 1% of his original money, which is 1% of 500 cents, or 5 cents.

Set up the equation:  
\[
500 - (120 + 75c) = 5
\]

Simplify:  
\[
500 - 120 - 75c = 5  
\]
\[
380 - 75c = 5  
\]
\[
380 - 5 = 75c  
\]
\[
375 = 75c  
\]
\[
c = \frac{375}{75} = 5

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

To verify:

gsm8k,gsm8k-439,MV-3,1,"To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne so that she arrives 5 minutes before him, let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the key information
- Wayne's drive time to the theater is 4 minutes.
- Bernadette's drive time is four times as long as Wayne's, so:
  - Bernadette's drive time = 4 × 4 minutes = 16 minutes.
- Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.

### Step 2: Define the variables
- Let \( t_W \) be the time (in minutes) when Wayne leaves.
- Wayne arrives at: \( t_W + 4 \) minutes.
- Let \( t_B \) be the time (in minutes) when Bernadette leaves.
- Bernadette arrives at: \( t_B + 16 \) minutes.

### Step 3: Set up the condition
- Bernadette needs to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so:
  \[
  t_B + 16 = (t_W + 4) - 5
  \]
- Simplify the equation:
  \[
  t_B + 16 = t_W + 4 - 5
  \]
  \[
  t_B + 16 = t_W - 1
  \]
- Rearrange to solve for the difference:
  \[
  t_B + 17 = t_W
  \]
  \[
  t_W - t_B = 17
  \]

### Step 4: Interpret the result
- This means Bernadette needs to leave 17 minutes before Wayne.

### Verification
- If Bernadette leaves at time 0:
  - She arrives at 0 + 16 = 16 minutes.
- If Wayne leaves 17 minutes later, at time 17:
  - He arrives at 17 + 4 = 21 minutes.
- The difference: 21 - 16 = 5 minutes, which matches the requirement.

**Scenario 1: Buying the Super Ticket**
*   Super ticket cost: $20
*   Popcorn and soda cost (with super ticket): $1
*   Total cost if you bought the super ticket: $20 + $1 = $21

**Scenario 2: Buying a Regular Ticket and items separately**
*   Regular movie ticket cost: $12
*   Soda cost: $3
*   Let the regular price of popcorn be 'P'.
*   Total cost if you bought the regular ticket and items separately: $12 + P + $3 = $15 + P

**Comparing the two scenarios**
The problem states that you *didn't* buy the super ticket and ended up saving $2. This means the total cost in Scenario 2 was $2 less than the total cost in Scenario 1.

So, we can set up the equation:
Cost (Scenario 2) = Cost (Scenario 1) - $2
$15 + P = $21 - $2
$15 + P = $19

gsm8k,gsm8k-451,MV-3,1,"To determine how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons after the price increase, we first need to find the original cost of filling one helium balloon.

1. **Calculate the original cost per balloon:**
   The total cost for filling 20 balloons was $900. Therefore, the cost per balloon can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of balloons}} = \frac{900}{20} = 45
   \]

   So, the original cost per balloon was $45.

2. **Determine the new cost per balloon after the price increase:**
   The cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. Thus, the new cost per balloon is:

   \[
   \text{New cost per balloon} = \text{Original cost per balloon} + 20 = 45 + 20 = 65

3. **Calculate the total cost for filling 170 balloons at the new price:**
   Now, we can find out how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons at the new price of $65 per balloon:

   \[

### Step 1: Identify the groups
- Total number of kids: 32
- Kids allergic to dairy only: We know 9 kids are allergic to dairy, but 3 of them are also allergic to peanuts. So, kids allergic only to dairy = 9 - 3 = 6.
- Kids allergic to peanuts only: We know 6 kids are allergic to peanuts, but 3 of them are also allergic to dairy. So, kids allergic only to peanuts = 6 - 3 = 3.
- Kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts: 3.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of kids with at least one allergy
- Add up the groups: Kids allergic only to dairy + Kids allergic only to peanuts + Kids allergic to both = 6 + 3 + 3 = 12.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of kids with no allergies
- Subtract the number of kids with at least one allergy from the total number of kids: 32 - 12 = 20.

The 2010 penny weighs three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, so:  
Weight of 2010 penny = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \) grains.  
Calculating this:

The combined weight of both pennies is:  
Weight of 1959 penny + Weight of 2010 penny = 48 grains + 36 grains = 84 grains.  

Alternatively, the combined weight can be found directly:  
Let \( W \) be the weight of the 1959 penny (48 grains).  
Then the combined weight is \( W + \frac{3}{4}W = \frac{7}{4}W \).

### Step 1: Define the variables
- Let \( B \) represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
- David found half of what Bodhi found, so David found \( \frac{1}{2} B \).
- Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found \( \frac{1}{2} B + 7 \).

### Step 2: Set up the equation
The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore:
\[
(\frac{1}{2} B + 7) + (\frac{1}{2} B) + B = 43
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the equation
Combine the terms:
\[
\frac{1}{2} B + \frac{1}{2} B + B + 7 = 43
\]
\[
1B + B + 7 = 43
\]
\[
2B + 7 = 43
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( B \)
Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[
2B = 36
\]
Divide by 2:
\[
B = 18
\]
So, Bodhi found 18 insects.

- David found \( \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9 \) insects.
- Lily found 7 more than David: \( 9 + 7 = 16 \) insects.

### Step 6: Verify the total
Lily: 16 insects  
David: 9 insects  
Bodhi: 18 insects  
Total: \( 16 + 9 + 18 = 43 \), which matches the given information.

### Step 1: Understand the problem
- Rose bought 4 times the number of onions that Sophia bought.
- Rose bought 4 times the number of potatoes that Sophia bought.
- We know Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes.
- We need to find out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought in total.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of onions Sophia bought
- Let \( S_{\text{onions}} \) be the number of onions Sophia bought.
- Rose bought 4 times as many onions as Sophia, so:
  \[
  4 \times S_{\text{onions}} = 12
  \]
- Solving for \( S_{\text{onions}} \):
  \[
  S_{\text{onions}} = \frac{12}{4} = 3
  \]
- Therefore, Sophia bought 3 onions.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of potatoes Sophia bought
- Let \( S_{\text{potatoes}} \) be the number of potatoes Sophia bought.
- Rose bought 4 times as many potatoes as Sophia, so:
  \[
  4 \times S_{\text{potatoes}} = 4
  \]
- Solving for \( S_{\text{potatoes}} \):
  \[
  S_{\text{potatoes}} = \frac{4}{4} = 1
  \]
- Therefore, Sophia bought 1 potato.

### Step 4: Calculate the total
- The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is:
  \[
  S_{\text{onions}} + S_{\text{potatoes}} = 3 + 1 = 4
  \]

### Final Answer
Sophia bought a total of 4 items at the market: 3 onions and 1 potato.",0.0037565899999999,13.023596286773682,0,0,MajorityVoting-k3,,,0

### Step 1: Determine each person's picking rate
- **Tony** picks 6 quarts per hour (given directly).
- **Bobby** picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so:  
  Bobby's rate = Tony's rate - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.
- **Kathy** picks twice as many quarts per hour as Bobby, so:  
  Kathy's rate = 2 × Bobby's rate = 2 × 5 = 10 quarts per hour.
- **Ricky** picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy, so:  
  Ricky's rate = Kathy's rate - 2 = 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

### Step 2: Calculate the total
Now, add up their individual rates:  
- Tony: 6 quarts/hour  
- Bobby: 5 quarts/hour  
- Kathy: 10 quarts/hour  
- Ricky: 8 quarts/hour

- Then 1 person paints a whole house in 5 × 2 = 10 days

**Step 2: Calculate the work rate**
- 1 person completes 1 house in 10 days

- Ophelia has 20 sofas
- Each person has 2 fewer sofas than chairs
- Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia

**Step 1: Find how many chairs Ophelia has**

Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs:
- Sofas = Chairs - 2
- 20 = Chairs - 2
- Chairs = 20 + 2 = 22

1. **Cost of the Computer**: Errol paid $1,100 for the computer.

2. **Cost of the Printer**: The printer cost $400 less than the computer. Therefore, the cost of the printer is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of Printer} = \text{Cost of Computer} - 400 = 1,100 - 400 = 700
   \]

3. **Total Cost of the Computer, Monitors, and Printer**: The total amount Errol spent is $2,400. We can express this as:

   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   2,400 = 1,100 + \text{Cost of Monitors} + 700
   \]

4. **Calculating the Cost of the Monitors**: First, we can simplify the equation:

4. **Shells brought by girls**: According to the problem, the number of shells brought by the girls is equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. Let's denote the total number of shells brought by the girls as \( G \).

   The total number of shells brought by the girls can be expressed as:

### Step 1: Understand the initial setup
- The pyramids are at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground, as observed from the entrance of Sahir's house. This means the angle of elevation to the tip of the pyramid (where the sun starts) is 32 degrees.
- The sun begins at the tip of the pyramid, so its initial angle of elevation from the ground is 32 degrees.

### Step 2: Understand the sun's movement
- The sun moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour straight upward relative to the pyramid and Sahir's house.
- This implies that the angle of elevation of the sun increases by 5 degrees for each hour it moves.
- The total time of movement is 10 hours.

- Total increase in angle: 5 degrees/hour × 10 hours = 50 degrees.
- Final angle: Initial angle + Total increase = 32 degrees + 50 degrees = 82 degrees.

gsm8k,gsm8k-580,MV-3,1,"Maggie's oven is consistently overheating by a certain percentage. Let's break this down step by step to determine the correct setting for her recipe.

### Step 1: Calculate the percentage error
- When Maggie sets the oven to 450 degrees, the actual temperature is 468 degrees.
- The difference is: 468 - 450 = 18 degrees.
- The percentage error is:  
  \[
  \text{Percentage error} = \left( \frac{\text{Actual temperature} - \text{Set temperature}}{\text{Set temperature}} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100\% = 4\%
  \]
- This means the oven is running 4% hotter than the set temperature.

### Step 2: Apply the same percentage error to the new recipe
- The recipe calls for an actual temperature of 520 degrees.
- Let \( S \) be the set temperature we need to find.
- Since the oven is 4% hotter, the actual temperature is 104% (or 1.04 times) of the set temperature:  
  \[
  \text{Actual temperature} = S \times 1.04
  \]
- We want the actual temperature to be 520 degrees, so:  
  \[
  S \times 1.04 = 520
  \]
- Solving for \( S \):  
  \[
  S = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500
  \]

### Step 3: Conclusion
Maggie should set her oven to **500 degrees** to achieve an actual temperature of approximately 520 degrees, based on the consistent 4% error.

- Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's house

**Step 1: Calculate the value of Juan's house**

If Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's house, then:
- 30% of Herb's house = 0.30 × $76,000 = $22,800
- Juan's house = Herb's house - 30% of Herb's house
- Juan's house = $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

Alternatively: Juan's house = 70% of Herb's house = 0.70 × $76,000 = $53,200

**Step 2: Calculate the combined value of both houses**

- Judy bought a dozen cups. A dozen means 12, so Judy brought **12 cups**.
- She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so the number of dishes Judy bought is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.

### Step 1: Calculate calories burned from aerobics
- Hannah does aerobics for 2 hours at 500 calories per hour.
- Calories from aerobics = 2 hours × 500 calories/hour = 1,000 calories.

### Step 2: Calculate calories burned from running
- Hannah runs for 1 hour at 600 calories per hour.

### Step 1: Start with Alex
- Alex is hosting and attending the event, so she needs a seat.
- **Seats for Alex: 1**

### Step 2: Account for the email invitations
- Alex invites 100 people via email.
- Each of these 100 invited people will invite 2 of their friends, and we assume all invited friends will attend.
- So, the 100 invited people themselves need seats.
- Additionally, the 2 friends per invited person: 100 × 2 = 200 friends.
- **Seats for email invitations: 100 (invited people) + 200 (their friends) = 300**

### Step 3: Account for the phone invitations
- Alex calls 10 friends to invite them, and we assume all 10 will attend.
- Out of these 10, 8 say they will bring their spouses, so that's 8 additional people (one spouse per person).
- **Seats for phone invitations: 10 (friends) + 8 (spouses) = 18**

### Step 4: Calculate the total
- Add up all the seats:
  - Seats for Alex: 1
  - Seats for email invitations: 300
  - Seats for phone invitations: 18
- Total seats = 1 + 300 + 18 = 319

gsm8k,gsm8k-603,MV-3,1,"First, let's determine how much chocolate Ruiz makes in one hour.

Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours, so in 1 hour, he makes:

\[
\text{Ruiz's rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour}
\]

Next, we calculate how much Marissa makes in one hour. According to the problem, Marissa makes \( \frac{3}{4} \) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in the two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, Marissa's hourly production is:

\[
\text{Marissa's rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 \text{ pounds} = 90 \text{ pounds per hour}
\]

Now, we can find out how much chocolate each of them makes in 12 hours.

For Ruiz:

\[
\text{Total for Ruiz} = \text{Ruiz's rate} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds}
\]

For Marissa:

\[
\text{Total for Marissa} = \text{Marissa's rate} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the total amounts of chocolate made by both Ruiz and Marissa:

\[
\text{Total chocolate pounds} = \text{Total for Ruiz} + \text{Total for Marissa} = 720 \text{ pounds} + 1080 \text{ pounds} = 1800 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

### Step 1: Identify the given information
- The price of the diamond jewel is $2000.
- The price of the gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of the diamond jewel.
- The price of the silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel.

### Step 2: Calculate the price of the gold jewel
- Price of gold jewel = (4/5) × Price of diamond jewel

### Step 1: Calculate the volume of the hole
The hole is a rectangular prism with the following dimensions:
- Length: 6 feet
- Width: 4 feet
- Depth: 3 feet

The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is:
\[
\text{Volume} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Depth}
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Volume} = 6 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} \times 3 \, \text{ft} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet}
\]

So, the hole has a volume of 72 cubic feet.

### Step 2: Determine the time required per cubic foot
It takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot of earth.

### Step 3: Calculate the total time
To find the total time, multiply the volume of the hole by the time per cubic foot:
\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Volume} \times \text{Time per cubic foot}
\]
\[
\text{Total time} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} = 216 \, \text{seconds}
\]

### Step 4: Interpret the result
216 seconds is the total time required. For better understanding, we can convert this to minutes:
- 216 seconds ÷ 60 = 3 minutes and 36 seconds (since 216 ÷ 60 = 3 remainder 36).

### Final Answer
It will take Bob **216 seconds** (or approximately **3 minutes and 36 seconds**) to dig the hole.",0.0026318,8.884196996688843,0,0,MajorityVoting-k3,,,0

### Step 2: Calculate the remaining pages.  
\[
15 - 5 = 10 \text{ pages}
\]  

Alternatively, since \( \frac{1}{3} \) is completed, \( \frac{2}{3} \) remains.

1. **Cooking time for rice**: The query states that it took 30 minutes to cook rice.

2. **Cooking time for pork**: It took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice.  
   So, pork cooking time = rice cooking time + 20 minutes = 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.

3. **Cooking time for beans**: Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.  
   First, calculate the combined cooking time of pork and rice: 50 minutes (pork) + 30 minutes (rice) = 80 minutes.  
   Then, beans cooking time = half of 80 minutes = 80 minutes ÷ 2 = 40 minutes.

4. **Total time to cook all the food**: Assuming the foods are cooked sequentially (one after another, as the query doesn't specify simultaneous cooking), the total time is the sum of the individual cooking times:

gsm8k,gsm8k-660,MV-3,1,"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let:
- \( s \) = number of sheep
- \( g \) = number of geese

We know the following:
1. Each sheep has 4 legs, and each goose has 2 legs. The total number of legs is 70.
   \[
   4s + 2g = 70
   \]
2. Each animal has 1 head. The total number of heads is 20.
   \[
   s + g = 20
   \]

Now we have the following system of equations:
1. \( 4s + 2g = 70 \)
2. \( s + g = 20 \)

We can solve this system step by step.

First, we can simplify the first equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[
2s + g = 35
\]

Now we have:
1. \( 2s + g = 35 \)
2. \( s + g = 20 \)

Next, we can subtract the second equation from the first:
\[
(2s + g) - (s + g) = 35 - 20
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
s = 15
\]

Now that we have \( s \), we can substitute it back into the second equation to find \( g \):
\[
15 + g = 20
\]
\[
g = 20 - 15 = 5
\]

Thus, the number of sheep \( s \) is 15, and the number of geese \( g \) is 5.

Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( \boxed{15} \).",0.0079464399999999,10.654223680496216,0,0,MajorityVoting-k3,,,1

gsm8k,gsm8k-679,MV-3,1,"To determine how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can use a proportional relationship.

### Step-by-Step Solution:
1. **Find the hash browns per potato:**  
   Since 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, divide the number of hash browns by the number of potatoes:  
   \[
   \frac{36 \text{ hash browns}}{6 \text{ potatoes}} = 6 \text{ hash browns per potato}
   \]

2. **Calculate for 96 potatoes:**  
   Multiply the number of potatoes by the hash browns per potato:  
   \[
   96 \text{ potatoes} \times 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} = 576 \text{ hash browns}
   \]

### Alternative Method Using Proportions:
- Set up the proportion:  
  \[
  \frac{6 \text{ potatoes}}{36 \text{ hash browns}} = \frac{96 \text{ potatoes}}{H \text{ hash browns}}
  \]
- Cross-multiply to solve for \(H\):  
  \[
  6 \times H = 36 \times 96
  \]
  \[
  6H = 3456
  \]
  \[
  H = \frac{3456}{6} = 576
  \]

### Verification:
- The ratio of potatoes to hash browns is constant:  
  \[
  \frac{6}{36} = \frac{1}{6} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{96}{576} = \frac{96 \div 96}{576 \div 96} = \frac{1}{6}

    The extension amount is $0.50 \times L = 0.5L$.
    The new length after this extension is $L + 0.5L = 1.5L$.

2.  **Add 20cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim:**
    The length of the dress now becomes $1.5L + 20$.

3.  **The final design is 140cm long:**
    We can set up the equation:
    $1.5L + 20 = 140$

4.  **Solve for L:**
    Subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
    $1.5L = 140 - 20$
    $1.5L = 120$

    Divide by 1.5:

Therefore, the original length of the dress was 80 centimeters.

    *   Let 'X' be the total bill.
    *   The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, which means the vaccines make up the remaining 40% of the total bill.
    *   So, $40 (cost of vaccines) = 40% of X

Topher's shoe length is 8 feet and 4 inches. We know that:
- 1 foot = 12 inches

So, we convert 8 feet to inches:
\[
8 \text{ feet} = 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ inches}
\]
Now, adding the 4 inches:
\[
\text{Total length of Topher's shoe} = 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches}
\]

Next, we set up the equation based on the information given in the problem. Let \( b \) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. This can be expressed as:
\[
\text{Length of Topher's shoe} = 9b + 10
\]

We know that the length of Topher's shoe is 100 inches, so we can set up the equation:
\[
100 = 9b + 10
\]

Now, we solve for \( b \):
1. Subtract 10 from both sides:
\[
100 - 10 = 9b
\]
\[
90 = 9b
\]

2. Divide both sides by 9:
\[
b = \frac{90}{9} = 10

### Step 1: Understand the total number of students and the given information
- Total students: 50
- Students who like to bake: 10
- Students who like to play basketball: 5
- The rest of the students (after accounting for baking and basketball) like either video games or music.
- The number of students who like to play music is twice the number who prefer playing basketball. Since the number who prefer playing basketball is 5, the number who like music is \(2 \times 5 = 10\).

### Step 2: Calculate the number of students in the ""rest"" category
- The ""rest"" category includes only students who like video games or music.
- Number of students not in baking or basketball: \(50 - 10 - 5 = 35\)
- So, 35 students like either video games or music.

### Step 1: Understand the time period
- Two 4-week months means a total of 2 × 4 = 8 weeks.
- In 8 weeks, there are 8 × 7 = 56 days.
- A standard week has:
  - 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday).
  - 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday).
- Therefore, in 8 weeks:
  - Number of weekdays: 8 × 5 = 40 days.
  - Number of weekend days: 8 × 2 = 16 days.

### Step 2: Calculate chairs rented per type of day
- Weekdays: 60 chairs are rented each day.
  - Total for weekdays: 40 days × 60 chairs/day = 2,400 chairs.
- Weekends: 100 chairs are rented each day.
  - Total for weekends: 16 days × 100 chairs/day = 1,600 chairs.

### Step 3: Add up the totals

*   Exchange rate: 1 large button = 3 small stickers.
*   Large buttons gained: 27 small stickers / 3 small stickers per large button = 9 large buttons.

**3. Trade 50% of large stickers for large buttons:**
*   Large stickers traded: 50% of 40 = 0.50 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
*   Exchange rate: 1 large sticker = 1 large button.
*   Large buttons gained: 20 large stickers * 1 large button per large sticker = 20 large buttons.

**4. Trade the remaining large stickers for small buttons:**
*   Remaining large stickers: 40 (initial) - 20 (traded for large buttons) = 20 large stickers.

Let 'A' be the number of votes against the new regulation.

We are given two pieces of information:

1.  **""The vote passed with twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it.""**
    This can be written as an equation: F = 2A

2.  **""If there are 33 people on the council...""**
    This means the total number of votes (in favor + against) is 33.

### Step 1: Determine the number of students for each size
- **Extra-Small (XS):** 11 students (directly given).
- **Small (S):** Twice as many as extra-small, so:  
  \( S = 2 \times 11 = 22 \) students.
- **Medium (M):** Four less than the number of small, so:  
  \( M = S - 4 = 22 - 4 = 18 \) students.
- **Large (L):** Half as many as medium, so:  
  \( L = \frac{1}{2} \times M = \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9 \) students.
- **Extra-Large (XL):** Six more than large, so:  
  \( XL = L + 6 = 9 + 6 = 15 \) students.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of shirts
Add up the students for all sizes:  
- Total shirts = XS + S + M + L + XL  
- Total shirts = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15  

Now, perform the addition:

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- Two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians.
- One third of the Pomeranians are girls.
- We know there are 6 Pomeranian girls.

Let \( T \) represent the total number of puppies Jana has.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of Pomeranians
- The number of Pomeranians is \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the total puppies.
- So, number of Pomeranians = \( \frac{2}{3} T \).

### Step 3: Calculate the number of Pomeranian girls
- One third of the Pomeranians are girls.
- So, number of Pomeranian girls = \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the number of Pomeranians.
- Substitute the expression from Step 2: Number of Pomeranian girls = \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{2}{3} T = \frac{2}{9} T \).
- We are told this equals 6, so: \( \frac{2}{9} T = 6 \).

### Step 4: Solve for \( T \)
- Multiply both sides by \( \frac{9}{2} \) to isolate \( T \):
  \[
  T = 6 \times \frac{9}{2} = 3 \times 9 = 27
  \]

### Step 5: Verify the solution
- If \( T = 27 \):
  - Number of Pomeranians = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 27 = 18 \).
  - Number of Pomeranian girls = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6 \).
- This matches the given information.

Let H3 be the number of cases for the third house.

We are given the following information:
1.  Total cases needed = 250 (H1 + H2 + H3 = 250)
2.  The first house needs 1/2 of the second (H1 = H2 / 2)
3.  The third house needs double the first (H3 = 2 * H1)

From equation (2), we can express H2 in terms of H1:
H2 = 2 * H1

Now we have H1, H2 (in terms of H1), and H3 (in terms of H1). Let's substitute these into the total cases equation (1):
H1 + (2 * H1) + (2 * H1) = 250

Combine the terms:
5 * H1 = 250

Solve for H1:
H1 = 250 / 5
H1 = 50 cases

The question asks for the number of cases the third house will need. We know that H3 = 2 * H1.
H3 = 2 * 50
H3 = 100 cases

To verify:
First house (H1) = 50 cases
Second house (H2) = 2 * H1 = 2 * 50 = 100 cases
Third house (H3) = 2 * H1 = 2 * 50 = 100 cases
Total = 50 + 100 + 100 = 250 cases. This matches the given total.

- Therefore, Sally's hourly rate = $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

### Step 2: Determine Billy's current hourly rate
- Billy started at $10 per hour.
- After 2 months, he received a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his rate $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

gsm8k,gsm8k-814,MV-3,1,"To determine how much money is used for the arcade games, we first need to calculate how long each person can play with one quarter and then find out how many quarters are needed for the total playtime.

1. **Jack's Playtime:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter.

2. **Two Friends' Playtime:**
   - Each of the two friends who are worse can play for half as long as Jack.
   - Therefore, each of them can play for \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) minutes with 1 quarter.

3. **Better Friend's Playtime:**
   - The friend who is better can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack.
   - Therefore, this friend can play for \( 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \) minutes with 1 quarter.

Now, let's summarize the playtime for each person:

- Jack: 20 minutes
- Friend 1: 10 minutes
- Friend 2: 10 minutes
- Better Friend: 30 minutes

Next, we need to calculate the total playtime for all four players over the 4 hours they played:

4 hours = 240 minutes.

Now, we can calculate how many quarters are needed for each player based on their individual playtimes:

- **Jack's Quarters:**
  \[
  \text{Quarters for Jack} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters}
  \]

- **Friend 1's Quarters:**
  \[
  \text{Quarters for Friend 1} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters}
  \]

- **Friend 2's Quarters:**
  \[
  \text{Quarters for Friend 2} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters}
  \]

- **Better Friend's Quarters:**
  \[
  \text{Quarters for Better Friend} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters}
  \]

Now, we can sum up the total number of quarters used:

\[
\text{Total Quarters} = 12 + 24 + 24 + 8 = 68 \text{ quarters}
\]

Finally, since each quarter costs $0.25, we can calculate the total money spent:

\[

gsm8k,gsm8k-815,MV-3,1,"Let's break down the problem by assigning variables to each ingredient and setting up equations based on the given information.

Let:
*   `Z` = amount of citrus zest (in ounces)
*   `F` = amount of fragrance (in ounces)
*   `S` = amount of salt (in ounces)
*   `G` = amount of sugar (in ounces)
*   `O` = amount of oil (in ounces)

We are given the following information:

1.  **Total volume:** `Z + F + S + G + O = 10` ounces
2.  **Zest and fragrance:** `Z = F`
3.  **Salt and sugar:** `S = G`
4.  **Oil and salt:** `O = 2 * S`
5.  **Salt and zest:** `S = 2 * Z`

Our goal is to find the amount of oil (`O`). We can express all ingredients in terms of a single variable, for instance, `Z`.

From (5): `S = 2 * Z`
From (3): `G = S`, so `G = 2 * Z`
From (4): `O = 2 * S`, substitute `S = 2 * Z`, so `O = 2 * (2 * Z) = 4 * Z`
From (2): `F = Z`

Now substitute all these expressions into the total volume equation (1):
`Z + F + S + G + O = 10`
`Z + Z + (2 * Z) + (2 * Z) + (4 * Z) = 10`

Combine the terms with `Z`:
`(1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 4) * Z = 10`
`10 * Z = 10`

Now, solve for `Z`:
`Z = 10 / 10`
`Z = 1` ounce

Finally, we can find the amount of oil (`O`) using the relationship `O = 4 * Z`:
`O = 4 * 1`
`O = 4` ounces

Let's check the amounts of all ingredients:
*   Zest (`Z`) = 1 ounce
*   Fragrance (`F`) = 1 ounce (since `F = Z`)
*   Salt (`S`) = 2 ounces (since `S = 2 * Z`)
*   Sugar (`G`) = 2 ounces (since `G = S`)
*   Oil (`O`) = 4 ounces (since `O = 2 * S` or `O = 4 * Z`)

Total: 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 10 ounces. This matches the jar size.

**Step 2: Identify what Angela needs installed**
- 6 mirrors

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **First segment:** Mason travels for 4 hours at 8 miles per hour.  
   - Distance = Speed × Time  
   - Distance = 8 miles/hour × 4 hours = 32 miles

2. **Rest period:** He takes some rest, but this does not contribute to the distance traveled, so we ignore it for the calculation.

3. **Second segment:** Mason then travels for another 6 hours at the same speed of 8 miles per hour.  
   - Distance = Speed × Time  
   - Distance = 8 miles/hour × 6 hours = 48 miles

gsm8k,gsm8k-835,MV-3,1,"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step based on the information provided.

### Step 1: Understand the kangaroos' situation
- We have 3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed, and they take a total of 18 hours to travel across the highway.
- This likely means the total time for all three kangaroos to complete the trip is 18 hours. Assuming they each take the same amount of time to cross (since they travel at the same speed), we can divide the total time by the number of kangaroos:
  - Time per kangaroo = Total time ÷ Number of kangaroos = 18 hours ÷ 3 = 6 hours per kangaroo.

So, each kangaroo takes 6 hours to cross the highway.

### Step 2: Determine the speed of the kangaroos and turtles
- Let the speed of one kangaroo be \( v \) (distance per hour).
- The distance of the highway is \( d \), so for one kangaroo: \( d = v \times 6 \), or \( v = \frac{d}{6} \).
- Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} = \frac{d}{6} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{d}{12} \).

### Step 3: Calculate the time for one turtle
- For one turtle to cross the same distance \( d \) at speed \( \frac{d}{12} \):
  - Time for one turtle = Distance ÷ Speed = \( d ÷ \frac{d}{12} = 12 \) hours.

### Step 4: Calculate the total time for four turtles
- Similar to the kangaroos, we need the total time for all four turtles to cross.
- If each turtle takes 12 hours, then for four turtles: Total time = 4 × 12 hours = 48 hours.

### Final Answer:
It will take the four turtles a total of **48 hours** to travel across the highway.",0.00311072,71.23734998703003,0,0,MajorityVoting-k3,,,1

**Step 1: Calculate the reduced price of the laptop**
- Original price: $600
- Trade-in discount: $200
- New price: $600 - $200 = $400

**Step 2: Set up the equation**
Erika's total money comes from:
- Money in her purse: x
- Part-time job payment: $150
- Mom's contribution: $80

Total money available: x + $150 + $80

**Step 3: Use the given information**
We know that Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means:
- Money she has + $50 = Price of laptop
- (x + $150 + $80) + $50 = $400

**Step 4: Solve for x**

Let me break this down step by step to calculate the total number of socks and dishes that Peter and Jack have together.

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- Jack collected 60 dishes.
- Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so the number of socks Jack has is half the number of dishes he has.
- Peter has twice as many socks as Jack.
- Peter has half as many dishes as Jack.

### Step 2: Calculate Jack's socks
- Jack has 60 dishes.
- Jack's dishes are twice his socks, so:

  \text{Jack's socks} = \frac{\text{Jack's dishes}}{2} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate Peter's socks
- Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so:

First, let's define variables for everyone's age:
*   Your age: `Y`
*   Brother's age: `B`
*   Sister's age: `S`
*   Mom's age: `M`

Now, let's translate the given information into equations:

1.  ""I am three years younger than my brother""
    `Y = B - 3`
    This also means `B = Y + 3`

2.  ""I am 2 years older than my sister""
    `Y = S + 2`
    This also means `S = Y - 2`

3.  ""My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age""
    `M = 3B - 1`
    Substitute `B = Y + 3` into this equation:
    `M = 3(Y + 3) - 1`
    `M = 3Y + 9 - 1`
    `M = 3Y + 8`

4.  ""When you add all our ages, you get 87""
    `Y + B + S + M = 87`

Now, substitute the expressions for `B`, `S`, and `M` (all in terms of `Y`) into the total age equation:
`Y + (Y + 3) + (Y - 2) + (3Y + 8) = 87`

Combine the `Y` terms:
`Y + Y + Y + 3Y = 6Y`

Combine the constant terms:
`3 - 2 + 8 = 1 + 8 = 9`

So the equation becomes:
`6Y + 9 = 87`

Subtract 9 from both sides:
`6Y = 87 - 9`
`6Y = 78`

Divide by 6:
`Y = 78 / 6`
`Y = 13`

So, you are 13 years old.

Let A be the number of books Anne has.
Let F be the number of books Fawn has.

We are given the following information:
1.  Together, Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books: S + A + F = 85
2.  Sofie has 25 more books than Anne: S = A + 25
3.  Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn: A = F - 12

Our goal is to find the number of books Fawn has (F).

We can express S and A in terms of F:
From equation (3), we already have A in terms of F:
A = F - 12

Now substitute this expression for A into equation (2) to find S in terms of F:
S = (F - 12) + 25
S = F + 13

Now substitute the expressions for S and A (both in terms of F) into equation (1):
(F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85

Combine the F terms and the constant terms:
(F + F + F) + (13 - 12) = 85
3F + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides of the equation:
3F = 85 - 1
3F = 84

Divide by 3 to solve for F:
F = 84 / 3
F = 28

So, Fawn has 28 books.

Let's check the numbers:
If Fawn has 28 books:
Anne has A = F - 12 = 28 - 12 = 16 books.
Sofie has S = A + 25 = 16 + 25 = 41 books.

Total books: S + A + F = 41 + 16 + 28 = 57 + 28 = 85.

- Remaining plants = 100 - 25 = 75 plants

### Step 3: Calculate the outdoor plants from the remaining.
- Outdoor plants: Two-thirds of the remaining plants
- Outdoor plants = 75 × (2/3) = 50 plants

### Step 4: Calculate the flowering plants.
- Flowering plants are the rest of the remaining plants.
- Flowering plants = Remaining plants - Outdoor plants
- Flowering plants = 75 - 50 = 25 plants

### Step 5: Find the percentage of flowering plants out of the total.
- Percentage of flowering plants = (Flowering plants / Total plants) × 100
- Percentage = (25 / 100) × 100 = 25%

So, 25% of the total plants are flowering plants. Let me know if you'd like me to explain any part further!",0.0061068,7.363887548446655,0,0,MajorityVoting-k3,,,1

### Step 1: Understand the soup portions
- 1 adult bowl is equivalent to the amount of soup for one adult.
- The pot can fill 4 adult bowls, so the total soup is enough for 4 adult portions.
- It can also fill 8 child bowls, which means 1 child bowl is half the size of 1 adult bowl (since 8 child bowls = 4 adult bowls).

### Step 2: Calculate soup used for dinner
- Calvin and his wife are adults, so they each eat 1 adult bowl: 2 adult bowls.
- His two children each eat 1 child bowl: 2 child bowls.
- Convert everything to adult bowls for consistency:
  - 2 adult bowls = 2 adult bowls.
  - 2 child bowls = 2 × (0.5 adult bowls) = 1 adult bowl.
- Total soup used: 2 adult bowls + 1 adult bowl = 3 adult bowls.

### Step 3: Calculate leftover soup
- Total soup available: 4 adult bowls.
- Soup used: 3 adult bowls.
- Leftover soup: 4 adult bowls - 3 adult bowls = 1 adult bowl.

### Step 4: Determine how many child bowls can be made from the leftover
- Leftover soup: 1 adult bowl.
- Each child bowl is 0.5 adult bowls.
- Number of child bowls from leftover: 1 adult bowl ÷ 0.5 adult bowls per child bowl = 2 child bowls.

### Step 5: Figure out servings for each child
- There are 2 child bowls leftover and 2 children.
- If each child gets an equal share, each child can have 1 child bowl.
- Therefore, each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch once.

### Step 1: Calculate what he's already spent
- **Movies on Fridays/Saturdays:** 5 tickets at $10 each = 5 × 10 = $50
- **Movies on other days:** 8 tickets at $7 each = 8 × 7 = $56
- **Popcorn:** 2 tubs at $8 each = 2 × 8 = $16
- **Candy:** 4 boxes at $2 each = 4 × 2 = $8

Total spent so far: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

### Step 2: Calculate remaining budget
Remaining money: $150 - $130 = $20

### Step 3: Determine costs for tonight
- Tonight is Friday, so each ticket costs $10.
- He wants to get one popcorn ($8) and one box of candy ($2) for the night.
- Total cost for snacks: $8 + $2 = $10

After buying the snacks, remaining money: $20 - $10 = $10

### Step 4: Calculate how many movies he can see
With $10 left, he can buy:
- One ticket at $10, which allows him to see 1 movie.

If he tries to see 2 movies, that would cost 2 × $10 = $20 for tickets alone, leaving no money for the snacks, which he wants to ensure he gets.

### Final Answer
Colby can see **1 movie** tonight after buying a popcorn and a box of candy.",0.0045541,17.89693522453308,0,0,MajorityVoting-k3,,,1

### Step 1: Calculate the total operating hours
- The machines run 24 hours per day for 30 days.
- Total hours = 24 hours/day × 30 days = 720 hours.

### Step 2: Calculate the total widgets produced by each machine
- Widgeteer 3000 produces 60 widgets per hour.
  - Total widgets = 60 widgets/hour × 720 hours = 43,200 widgets.
- WidgetMaster 9000 produces 45 widgets per hour.
  - Total widgets = 45 widgets/hour × 720 hours = 32,400 widgets.

### Step 3: Calculate the revenue from each machine
- Each widget sells for $6.
- Revenue from Widgeteer 3000 = 43,200 widgets × $6/widget = $259,200.
- Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000 = 32,400 widgets × $6/widget = $194,400.

### Step 4: Find the difference in revenue

2. **Cost of 12-hour stay plus additional hours**:
   - Cameron arrives at 5 PM and stays until 10 AM the next morning.
   - From 5 PM to 5 AM is 12 hours.
   - From 5 AM to 10 AM is an additional 5 hours.
   - The cost for the initial 12-hour stay is 1000 pesos.
   - For the additional 5 hours, he needs to pay 70 pesos for each hour:
     \[

2. ""Bahati scored the most points and it was 20 more than Azibo scored""
   - B = A + 20

3. ""Bahati scored... 10 more points than Dinar scored""
   - B = D + 10

**Solving:**

From equation 2: B = A + 20
From equation 3: B = D + 10

Since both equal B:
A + 20 = D + 10
D = A + 10

Now I'll substitute into equation 1:
B + A + D = 45
(A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45
A + 20 + A + A + 10 = 45
3A + 30 = 45
3A = 15
A = 5

**Verification:**
- Azibo scored: A = 5 points
- Bahati scored: B = 5 + 20 = 25 points
- Dinar scored: D = 5 + 10 = 15 points
- Total: 25 + 5 + 15 = 45 ✓
- Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo: 25 - 5 = 20 ✓
- Bahati scored 10 more than Dinar: 25 - 15 = 10 ✓

### Step 1: Determine the initial situation
- The hospital has a total of 1,000 beds.
- Initially, 1/5 of the beds are occupied:
  - Occupied beds = 1/5 × 1,000 = 200 beds.
- Therefore, unoccupied beds initially = 1,000 - 200 = 800 beds.

### Step 2: Account for new admissions
- 50 patients are admitted each day.
- There are 2 weeks, which is 14 days.
- Total patients admitted over 14 days = 50 patients/day × 14 days = 700 patients.

### Step 3: Calculate the new total of occupied beds
- These 700 new patients will occupy additional beds.
- New total occupied beds = Initial occupied beds + New admissions = 200 + 700 = 900 beds.

### Step 4: Calculate the unoccupied beds
- The hospital has 1,000 beds in total.
- Unoccupied beds after 14 days = Total beds - New total occupied beds = 1,000 - 900 = 100 beds.

   - Day 1: 10 holes
   - Day 2: 13 holes
   - Day 3: 8 holes dug, but they filled in 2 holes, so the effective holes dug on Day 3 is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

   Now, we can sum these up:
   \[
   \text{Total holes after Day 3} = 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 \text{ holes}

2. **Determine the number of holes at the end of the first day:**
   - At the end of Day 1, the pirates had dug 10 holes.

3. **Calculate the number of holes by the end of the fourth day:**
   - According to the problem, by the end of the fourth day, the number of holes was four times the number of holes at the end of the first day:

gsm8k,gsm8k-963,MV-3,1,"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe as \( A \), \( S \), and \( D \) respectively. We have the following information:

1. The total number of Pokemon caught by all three is 339:
   \[
   A + S + D = 339
   \]

2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan:
   \[
   A = S + 5
   \]

3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe:
   \[
   S = 4D - 13
   \]

Now we can substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( S \) in terms of \( D \) into the first equation.

First, substitute \( A \) into the total equation:
\[
(S + 5) + S + D = 339
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2S + D + 5 = 339
\]
Subtracting 5 from both sides gives:
\[
2S + D = 334
\]

Next, substitute \( S \) from the third equation into this equation:
\[
2(4D - 13) + D = 334
\]
Expanding this gives:
\[
8D - 26 + D = 334
\]
Combining like terms results in:
\[
9D - 26 = 334
\]
Adding 26 to both sides:
\[
9D = 360
\]
Dividing by 9:
\[
D = 40
\]

Now that we have \( D \), we can find \( S \):
\[
S = 4D - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
\]

Finally, we can find \( A \):
\[
A = S + 5 = 147 + 5 = 152
\]

Now we can check the total:
\[
A + S + D = 152 + 147 + 40 = 339

This confirms our calculations.

gsm8k,gsm8k-979,MV-3,1,"Emil is currently 19 years old. Let's denote:

- \( D \) as his dad's current age.
- \( B \) as his brother's current age.

The problem states that when Emil turns 24, which is in \( 24 - 19 = 5 \) years, the following will be true:

1. Emil will be half as old as his dad.
2. Emil will be twice as old as his brother.

In 5 years:
- Emil's age will be 24.
- Dad's age will be \( D + 5 \).
- Brother's age will be \( B + 5 \).

From the first condition:  
\( 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \)  
Multiply both sides by 2: \( 48 = D + 5 \)  
So, \( D = 48 - 5 = 43 \).

From the second condition:  
\( 24 = 2 (B + 5) \)  
Divide both sides by 2: \( 12 = B + 5 \)  
So, \( B = 12 - 5 = 7 \).

Therefore, his dad's current age is 43, and his brother's current age is 7.

1. **Calculate the amount of water pumped on the first day:**
   - The tank's capacity is 18,000 gallons.
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on Day 1} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}

   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on Day 1} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
     \]

2. **Total water pumped on the first day:**
   \[
   \text{Total water on Day 1} = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}

3. **Calculate the amount of water pumped on the second day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on Day 2} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}

   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on Day 2} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}

- Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold.
- Since Teresa sells twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

gsm8k,gsm8k-1027,MV-3,1,"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, let's reason through the problem step by step. The key information is that the prices are proportional to the number of sandwiches, meaning the price per sandwich remains constant across all packages.

### Step 1: Identify the price per sandwich
- The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3.
  - Price per sandwich = $3 ÷ 2 = $1.50 per sandwich.
- The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6.
  - Price per sandwich = $6 ÷ 4 = $1.50 per sandwich.

This confirms that the price is indeed proportional, as the cost per sandwich is the same ($1.50) for both packages.

### Step 2: Calculate the price for 8 sandwiches
- If each sandwich costs $1.50, then for 8 sandwiches:
  - Total price = 8 × $1.50 = $12.

### Step 3: Verify using proportionality
- We can also check this by comparing the ratios:
  - From 2 sandwiches ($3) to 4 sandwiches ($6), the price doubles when the quantity doubles.
  - From 4 sandwiches ($6) to 8 sandwiches, the quantity doubles again, so the price should also double: $6 × 2 = $12.
- Alternatively, comparing directly to the first package: 8 sandwiches is 4 times 2 sandwiches, so $3 × 4 = $12.

   So, total apples = 40 apples/box × 2 boxes = 80 apples.

2. **Calculate the number of packs:**  
   Each pack requires 8 apples.  
   To find out how many full packs can be made, divide the total apples by the number of apples per pack:  
   80 apples ÷ 8 apples/pack = 10 packs.

3. **Check for any leftovers:**  
   80 divided by 8 is exactly 10, with no remainder. This means all the apples can be used without any left over.

Therefore, Uncle Franky can make **10 packs** of apples with the two boxes.",0.00051565,7.939571857452393,0,0,MajorityVoting-k3,,,1

### Step 1: Understand the bed dimensions
- The bed measures 6 feet long and 8 feet wide.

### Step 2: Calculate the dimensions of each piece of fabric
- Each piece of fabric needs to be 2 feet longer than the bed's length:  
  6 feet (bed length) + 2 feet = 8 feet long.
- Each piece also needs to be 2 feet wider than the bed's width:  
  8 feet (bed width) + 2 feet = 10 feet wide.
- So, each piece of fabric is 8 feet by 10 feet.

### Step 3: Calculate the area of one piece of fabric
- The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width:  
  8 feet × 10 feet = 80 square feet.

### Step 4: Calculate the total fabric needed for two pieces

1. **First Race:**
   - Loss = $5

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - Amount lost in the first race = $5
   - Twice the amount lost = 2 * $5 = $10
   - Therefore, the amount won in the second race = $10 + $1 = $11

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Amount won in the second race = $11
   - Therefore, the amount lost in the third race = 1.5 * $11 = $16.5

Now, we can summarize the amounts:

- Total loss from the first race = $5
- Total win from the second race = $11 (this is a gain, so it doesn't count towards losses)
- Total loss from the third race = $16.5

Next, we calculate the total loss for the day:

- Total loss = Loss from the first race + Loss from the third race
- Total loss = $5 + $16.5 = $21.5

Now, we find the average loss over the three races:

- Number of races = 3
- Average loss = Total loss / Number of races
- Average loss = $21.5 / 3 ≈ $7.17

The initial price of the car in 2007 is $20,000, and we're calculating the price for 2010, which is 3 years later (from 2007 to 2008, 2008 to 2009, and 2009 to 2010).

The formula for exponential depreciation is:

\[
\text{Final Value} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{Final Value} = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 = 20000 \times (0.79)^3
\]

Now, calculate step by step:

1. First, compute \(0.79^3\):
   - \(0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.6241\)
   - \(0.6241 \times 0.79 = 0.493039\)

Therefore, the price of the car in 2010 is approximately **$9,860.78**.

### Step 1: Cost of the cast
- The doctor charges $200 for the cast.
- Total for the cast: **$200**

### Step 2: Cost of the doctor's visit
- The doctor's fee is $300 per hour for a 30-minute visit.
- 30 minutes is equivalent to 0.5 hours.
- Cost = $300/hour × 0.5 hours = **$150**
- Total for the doctor's visit: **$150**

### Step 3: Cost of the painkillers
- The doctor charges $4 per pill for 30 painkillers.
- Cost = $4/pill × 30 pills = **$120**
- Total for the painkillers: **$120**

### Step 4: Cost of parking
- The parking fee is $6 per hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours.
- Even though the visit is only 30 minutes, the minimum parking time is 2 hours.
- Cost = $6/hour × 2 hours = **$12**

- Then, it falls again, hits the ground, and bounces up to 2/3rds of the first bounce height for the second bounce.

### Step 3: Calculate the height of the first bounce
- Height after the first bounce:

   - Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself. 
   - After Ellen takes her soda, the remaining sodas are:
     - Shaken: 3
     - Unshaken: 8 (9 - 1 = 8)

3. **Ellen's Brother's Actions**: 
   - Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas.
   - After he takes his sodas, the remaining sodas are:
     - Shaken: 2 (3 - 1 = 2)
     - Unshaken: 6 (8 - 2 = 6)

4. **Total Remaining Sodas**: 
   - After both Ellen and her brother have taken sodas, there are a total of 8 sodas left (2 shaken + 6 unshaken).

5. **Calculating the Probability**: 
   - The probability that Ellen's friend picks a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of remaining sodas:

### Step 1: Initial Charge
- Sheila originally charged $85.00 worth of merchandise.

### Step 2: Subtract the Return
- She returned an item that cost $15.00.
- New balance: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

### Step 3: Calculate the Cost of the New Purchases
- **Frying pan**: The original price is $20.00, and it's on sale for 20% off.
  - 20% off means she pays 80% of the original price.
  - Discounted price: 80% of $20.00 = 0.80 × $20.00 = $16.00
- **Set of towels**: The original price is $30.00, and it's on sale for 10% off.
  - 10% off means she pays 90% of the original price.
  - Discounted price: 90% of $30.00 = 0.90 × $30.00 = $27.00

- 1/5 of jellyfish are large
- 1/3 of the large jellyfish change color (from green to blue) under UV light
- The remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue (don't change color)

x = 6 × 15
x = 90

- We know that 40% of the school's total population consists of boys.
- The number of boys is 240.

### Step 2: Calculate the total population
- If 40% of the total population (T) is 240 boys, we can set up the equation:
  \[

- Solve for T:
  \[
  T = \frac{240}{0.40} = 600

- The number of girls is 60% of the total population:

1. **Amalia's chore**: Mowing the lawn took her 4 hours.
   - Time taken by Amalia = 4 hours

2. **Megan's chore**: Walking the dog took her 2 hours longer than Amalia.
   - Time taken by Megan = Amalia's time + 2 hours = 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours

3. **Dior's chore**: Doing laundry took her well over 4 hours longer than the time Amalia took.
   - Since ""well over"" is not a specific number, we will assume it means at least 4 hours longer. Therefore, the minimum time taken by Dior = Amalia's time + 4 hours = 4 hours + 4 hours = 8 hours.
   - For the sake of calculation, let's assume Dior took exactly 8 hours (the minimum).

Now, we can calculate the total time they all took to do their chores:

- Total time = Time taken by Amalia + Time taken by Megan + Time taken by Dior
- Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours + 8 hours = 18 hours

gsm8k,gsm8k-1122,MV-3,1,"To find out how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total production of the first four workers:**
   - The first 2 workers produce 6 toys per hour each:
     \[
     2 \text{ workers} \times 6 \text{ toys/hour} = 12 \text{ toys/hour}
     \]
   - The next 2 workers produce 4 toys per hour each:
     \[
     2 \text{ workers} \times 4 \text{ toys/hour} = 8 \text{ toys/hour}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total production rate of the first four workers is:
     \[
     12 \text{ toys/hour} + 8 \text{ toys/hour} = 20 \text{ toys/hour}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total production over the 10-hour shift:**
   - The total number of toys produced by the first four workers in 10 hours is:
     \[
     20 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ toys}
     \]

3. **Determine how many toys are still needed:**
   - The manufacturer needs a total of 400 toys, and after the shift, they have produced 200 toys. Therefore, the number of toys still needed is:
     \[
     400 \text{ toys} - 200 \text{ toys} = 200 \text{ toys}
     \]

4. **Let \( x \) be the production rate of the fifth worker (toys per hour).**
   - The total production of all 5 workers in 10 hours is:
     \[
     200 \text{ toys} + (x \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours}) = 400 \text{ toys}
     \]
   - This simplifies to:
     \[

5. **Solve for \( x \):**

### Step 1: Calculate the total weight of M&Ms.
- John buys 3 large bags.
- Each large bag weighs 10 ounces.
- So, the total weight is:  
  \( 3 \times 10 = 30 \) ounces.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of M&Ms.

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

Thus, the time spent on the beach is:

\[
\text{Time on beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{v \text{ miles/hour}}
\]

We know that this time is 40 minutes. To convert 40 minutes into hours, we divide by 60:

\[
\text{Time on beach} = \frac{2}{v} = \frac{40}{60} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ hours}
\]

Now we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{v} = \frac{2}{3}
\]

To solve for \( v \), we cross-multiply:

\[
2 \cdot 3 = 2 \cdot v
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
6 = 2v \implies v = 3 \text{ miles/hour}
\]

Now, Grandma's speed on the sidewalk is twice her speed on the beach:

\[
\text{Speed on sidewalk} = 2v = 2 \cdot 3 = 6 \text{ miles/hour}
\]

Next, we calculate the time spent walking on the sidewalk. She walks 1 mile on the sidewalk, so the time spent on the sidewalk is:

\[
\text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{6 \text{ miles/hour}} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ hours}
\]

Now, we convert this time into minutes:

\[
\text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 10 \text{ minutes}
\]

Finally, we can find the total time for the entire 3-mile walk by adding the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time on beach} + \text{Time on sidewalk} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}

Let B be the length of the blue rope.
Let Y be the length of the yellow rope.

From the problem statement, we can set up the following equations:

1.  ""The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope.""
    R = 4B

2.  ""The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.""
    B = Y - 7
    This can also be written as Y = B + 7

3.  ""If the 3 ropes had a combined length of 37 centimeters""
    R + B + Y = 37

Now we want to find the length of the red rope (R). We can substitute the expressions for R and Y (in terms of B) into the combined length equation:

Substitute R = 4B and Y = B + 7 into the equation R + B + Y = 37:
(4B) + B + (B + 7) = 37

Combine the terms with B:
4B + B + B + 7 = 37
6B + 7 = 37

Subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:
6B = 37 - 7
6B = 30

Divide by 6 to solve for B:
B = 30 / 6
B = 5

So, the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters.

Now that we have the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope using the first equation:
R = 4B
R = 4 * 5
R = 20

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

To verify, we can also find the yellow rope's length:
Y = B + 7
Y = 5 + 7
Y = 12

Check the total length:
R + B + Y = 20 + 5 + 12 = 37 cm. This matches the given combined length.

- Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices and 4 pepperoni pizza slices.
- Total cheese slices needed: 6 friends × 6 slices each = 36 cheese slices.
- Total pepperoni slices needed: 6 friends × 4 slices each = 24 pepperoni slices.

### Step 2: Determine how many pizzas are required for each type

gsm8k,gsm8k-1215,MV-3,1,"To determine how far off Tim's guess was from the actual number of red jelly beans, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar**:
   The jar has a square base with dimensions 6 inches by 6 inches and a height of 15 inches. The volume \( V \) of the jar can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:
   \[
   V = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = (6 \, \text{inches} \times 6 \, \text{inches}) \times 15 \, \text{inches} = 36 \, \text{inches}^2 \times 15 \, \text{inches} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the effective volume for jelly beans**:
   Since Tim knows that they achieve about 80% packing efficiency, we can calculate the effective volume for the jelly beans:
   \[
   \text{Effective volume} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches} \times 0.80 = 432 \, \text{cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of jelly beans that can fit in the effective volume**:
   Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches. Therefore, the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the effective volume is:
   \[
   \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{432 \, \text{cubic inches}}{0.15 \, \text{cubic inches/jelly bean}} = 2880 \, \text{jelly beans}

4. **Estimate the number of red jelly beans**:
   Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red. Thus, the estimated number of red jelly beans is:
   \[

gsm8k,gsm8k-1217,MV-3,1,"To determine how much Pauline spent on all her museum visits, let's break this down step by step based on the information provided.

### Step 1: Calculate visits and costs for the first 5 years
- Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
- Number of visits in 5 years: 3 visits/year × 5 years = 15 visits.
- Cost per visit during this period: $2.
- Total cost for the first 5 years: 15 visits × $2/visit = $30.

### Step 2: Determine the new cost after 5 years
- The cost of one visit increases by 150%.
- Original cost: $2.
- Increase: 150% of $2 = 1.5 × $2 = $3.
- New cost: Original cost + Increase = $2 + $3 = $5.
  (Alternatively, a 150% increase means the new cost is $2 × (1 + 1.50) = $2 × 2.5 = $5.)

### Step 3: Calculate visits and costs for the next 3 years
- Pauline continues to visit 3 times a year for 3 more years.
- Number of visits in 3 years: 3 visits/year × 3 years = 9 visits.
- Cost per visit during this period: $5.
- Total cost for the next 3 years: 9 visits × $5/visit = $45.

### Step 4: Calculate the total spending

### Step 1: Understand the problem
- Ian has a board that is 40 feet long.
- He cuts it into two pieces, where the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece.
- We need to find the length of the longer piece.

### Step 2: Define the variables
- Let the length of the shorter piece be \( x \) feet.
- Then, the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet (since it's 4 times the shorter piece).

### Step 3: Set up the equation
- The total length of the board is the sum of the two pieces, which equals 40 feet.
- So, we can write:  
  \[
  x + 4x = 40
  \]

### Step 4: Solve the equation
- Combine like terms:  
  \[
  5x = 40
  \]
- Divide both sides by 5:  
  \[
  x = \frac{40}{5} = 8
  \]
- So, the shorter piece is 8 feet.
- The longer piece is \( 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \) feet.

### Step 5: Verify the solution
- The shorter piece is 8 feet, and the longer piece is 32 feet.
- Their total length is \( 8 + 32 = 40 \) feet, which matches the board's length.
- Also, 32 is indeed 4 times 8, so the conditions are satisfied.

1. **Calculate the total number of eggs Rose bought:**
   - One dozen equals 12 eggs.
   - She bought 5 dozens, so:  
     \( 5 \times 12 = 60 \) eggs.

2. **Calculate the total cost of the eggs:**
   - The cost is $2.40 per dozen.
   - For 5 dozens:  
     \( 5 \times 2.40 = 12.00 \) dollars.  
     So, the total cost is $12.00.

3. **Determine the revenue from selling the eggs:**
   - She sells the eggs at $1 for every 3 eggs.
   - She has 60 eggs, so the number of sets of 3 eggs is:  
     \( 60 \div 3 = 20 \) sets.
   - Revenue from selling:

\[
s + b = 116

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( b \) into the total equation:

gsm8k,gsm8k-1269,MV-3,1,"To determine how far Elvis is from his house after his journey, we can break down the problem into two parts: the distance he traveled west and the distance he traveled east.

1. **Distance traveled west:**
   - Speed = 18 mph
   - Time = 5 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles

2. **Distance traveled east:**
   - Speed = 18 mph
   - Time = 8 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles

3. **Net distance from his house:**
   - After traveling west, Elvis is 90 miles away from his house.
   - After turning around and traveling east, he travels 144 miles back towards his house.
   - To find the net distance from his house, we subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east:
     - Net distance = Distance traveled east - Distance traveled west
     - Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

Let me work through this step by step:

**Initial value:** $9,000

**After Year 1 (30% depreciation):**
- Depreciation means the boat loses 30% of its value
- It retains 70% of its value (100% - 30% = 70%)
- Value = $9,000 × 0.70 = $6,300

**After Year 2 (30% depreciation):**
- Again loses 30%, retains 70%
- Value = $6,300 × 0.70 = $4,410

**After Year 3 (20% depreciation):**
- Loses 20%, retains 80%
- Value = $4,410 × 0.80 = $3,528

**Answer: The boat is worth $3,528 after three years.**

gsm8k,gsm8k-1271,MV-3,1,"To find out how many pink candies are in the bag, we first need to determine the number of each color of candy based on the information provided.

1. **Red candies**: There are 54 red candies.
2. **Orange candies**: The number of orange candies is twice the amount of red candies:
   \[
   \text{Orange candies} = 2 \times 54 = 108
   \]
3. **Yellow candies**: The number of yellow candies is half the amount of red candies:
   \[
   \text{Yellow candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27
   \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of candies accounted for so far:
\[
\text{Total candies accounted for} = \text{Red} + \text{Orange} + \text{Yellow} = 54 + 108 + 27
\]
Calculating this gives:

Calculating this gives:

gsm8k,gsm8k-1303,MV-3,1,"Let's break this down step by step to determine how many weeks it takes for Nate to fill in all the holes.

### Step 1: Calculate the initial number of holes
- The dog digs 6 holes per day for 14 days while Nate is away.
- Total holes dug: \( 6 \times 14 = 84 \) holes.

So, there are 84 holes at the start when Nate begins filling them.

### Step 2: Determine the net progress per day
- Nate fills 9 holes per day.
- The dog digs 6 new holes every night.
- Net holes filled per day: \( 9 - 6 = 3 \) holes (Nate fills 3 more holes than the dog digs each full day).

This means the number of holes decreases by 3 per day.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of days needed
- Starting with 84 holes, we need to reduce the holes to 0.
- Holes reduced per day: 3.
- Days required: \( 84 \div 3 = 28 \) days.

After 28 days:
- At the start of day 28, there are \( 84 - 3 \times 27 = 84 - 81 = 3 \) holes.
- During day 28, Nate fills these 3 holes, leaving 0 holes at the end of his work for that day.

At this point, all holes are filled (before the dog digs at night).

### Step 4: Convert days to weeks
- There are 7 days in a week.
- Weeks required: \( 28 \div 7 = 4 \) weeks.

It takes Nate **4 weeks** to fill in all the holes.",0.0053753999999999,20.624635934829712,0,0,MajorityVoting-k3,,,1

1. **Total cookies made**: 7995
2. **Rainbow cookies**: 2595
3. **Oatmeal cookies**: 3075

Now, we can calculate the number of chocolate chip cookies by subtracting the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies:

\[

### Step 1: Understand the relationships
- Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, meaning Aaron's speed is twice Vanessa's speed.
- Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron. We're told Vanessa ran 4 miles, so Aaron ran half of that distance:  
  Aaron's distance = 4 miles ÷ 2 = 2 miles.
- Aaron completed his part (2 miles) in 16 minutes.

### Step 2: Calculate Aaron's speed
Speed is calculated as:  
Speed = Distance ÷ Time  

Aaron's speed = 2 miles ÷ 16 minutes = 0.125 miles per minute.

Since Aaron's speed is twice Vanessa's speed:  
Vanessa's speed = Aaron's speed ÷ 2 = 0.125 miles per minute ÷ 2 = 0.0625 miles per minute.

### Step 3: Calculate Vanessa's time
Vanessa ran 4 miles at her speed of 0.0625 miles per minute.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost price per watermelon
- The vendor bought 50 watermelons for a total of $80.
- Cost price per watermelon = Total cost ÷ Number of watermelons
- Cost price per watermelon = $80 ÷ 50 = $1.60

### Step 2: Determine the selling price with a 25% profit

Let \( c \) represent the number of chickens and \( w \) represent the number of cows. We can set up the following equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of animals is 20:  
   \( c + w = 20 \)

2. The total number of legs is 70:  
   \( 2c + 4w = 70 \)

Simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:  
   \( c + 2w = 35 \)

Now, subtract the first equation from this simplified equation:  
   \( (c + 2w) - (c + w) = 35 - 20 \)  
   \( c + 2w - c - w = 15 \)  
   \( w = 15 \)

So, there are 15 cows. Substitute this back into the first equation:

Therefore, there are 5 chickens.

To verify:  
- 5 chickens have \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \) legs.  
- 15 cows have \( 15 \times 4 = 60 \) legs.
