1. **Calculate the total investment**:
   - Purchase price of the house: $80,000
   - Repair costs: $50,000
   - Total investment = Purchase price + Repair costs
   \[
   \text{Total investment} = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the increased value of the house**:
   - The value of the house increased by 150%. 
   - To find the new value, we first calculate 150% of the original purchase price:
   \[
   \text{Increase in value} = 150\% \times 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000
   \]
   - Now, add this increase to the original purchase price to find the new value of the house:
   \[
   \text{New value of the house} = 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the profit**:
   - Profit is calculated as the new value of the house minus the total investment:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{New value of the house} - \text{Total investment}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000

### Step 1: Understand the problem
- Kyle bought the book for $19.50 after a 25% discount.
- A 25% discount means he paid 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

### Step 2: Set up the equation
- Let the original price be \( P \).
- 75% of \( P \) equals $19.50.
- Mathematically: \( 0.75 \times P = 19.50 \).

### Step 3: Solve for \( P \)
- Divide both sides by 0.75:  
  \( P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \).
- Performing the calculation:  
  \( 19.50 \div 0.75 = 26.00 \).

### Step 4: Verify the result
- If the original price was $26.00, a 25% discount would be \( 0.25 \times 26.00 = 6.50 \).
- Subtract the discount: \( 26.00 - 6.50 = 19.50 \), which matches the price Kyle paid.

### Step 1: Identify the costs of the items Marie purchased
- Chicken meal: 1 × $12 = $12
- Packs of milk: 5 × $3 = $15
- Apples: 4 × $1.50 = $6

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples
- Total cost so far: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33

### Step 3: Set up the equation for the total payment
- Marie paid a total of $50.
- Let \( x \) be the number of boxes of pizza, and each box costs $8.50.
- The equation is: $33 + (x \times 8.50) = 50$

### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)
- Subtract $33 from both sides: \( x \times 8.50 = 50 - 33 \)
- \( x \times 8.50 = 17 \)
- Divide both sides by 8.50: \( x = 17 \div 8.50 \)
- \( x = 2 \)

### Step 5: Verify the solution

According to the problem, the cost of the two pairs of high heels together is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. We can express this relationship mathematically as:

\[
B = \text{Cost of heels} + 5
\]

Next, we know that one pair of heels costs $33, and the other pair costs twice as much. Therefore, the cost of the second pair of heels is:

\[
2 \times 33 = 66

1. The first friend guesses **80** jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses **20 more than half the first one**:
   - Half of the first guess: \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \)
   - Adding 20: \( 40 + 20 = 60 \)
   - So, the second friend's guess is **60** jelly beans.
3. The third friend guesses **25% more than the first one**:
   - 25% of the first guess: \( 0.25 \times 80 = 20 \)

   \]

2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins:
   \[
   G = S + 30

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation. 

Substituting \( G \) in the first equation:

   \[
   \text{Weight from comic books} = 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Total weight he still needs to remove**:
   Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds. After removing the comic books, the remaining weight he needs to remove is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining weight to remove} = 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Weight of toys**:
   Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove to achieve the remaining weight of 7.5 pounds, we set up the equation:
   \[
   \text{Number of toys} \times \frac{1}{2} = 7.5
   \]

4. **Solving for the number of toys**:
   To find the number of toys, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
   \[
   \text{Number of toys} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15
   \]

Thus, Uriah needs to remove **15 toys**.",0.004484749999999999,12.646286487579346,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,

2. **Alex's weight**: He weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times Grace's weight.

   We can calculate Alex's weight as follows:
   \[
   \text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times \text{Grace's weight} - 2
   \]
   Substituting Grace's weight:
   \[
   \text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times 125 - 2
   \]
   \[
   \text{Alex's weight} = 500 - 2 = 498 \text{ pounds}

3. **Combined weight**: Now we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight together:
   \[

According to the problem, we have the following two equations:

1. The total number of games played:
   \[
   W + L = 22
   \]

2. The number of games won is 8 more than the number of games lost:
   \[
   W = L + 8

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:

\[

\[
H + 10H = 88,000

Combining the terms on the left side gives:

### Step 1: Calculate the inner dimensions
The walls are 1 inch thick on all sides, so we subtract twice the wall thickness (1 inch on each side) from each outer dimension:

- Outer length: 6 inches  
  Inner length = 6 - 2 × 1 = 6 - 2 = 4 inches

The total amount of sugar and water combined is given as 120 teaspoons. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

Combining the terms on the left side gives:

gsm8k,gsm8k-119,TrustRoute,1,"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago:**
   Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. If Adrien earned $40,000 four years ago, we can denote Lylah's salary as \( L \).

   \[
   40000 = L + 0.3L
   \]
   \[
   40000 = 1.3L
   \]
   \[
   L = \frac{40000}{1.3} \approx 30769.23
   \]

   So, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.

2. **Calculate Adrien's salary four years later:**
   We know that Adrien's salary increased by 40% over the four years.

   \[
   \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 0.4 \times 40000 = 40000 \times 1.4 = 56000
   \]

   Therefore, Adrien's salary four years later is $56,000.

3. **Determine Lylah's salary increase:**
   Since both salaries increased simultaneously and we need to find Lylah's salary after the same time period, we need to calculate the percentage increase in Lylah's salary. 

   Let’s denote Lylah's salary increase percentage as \( x \). Thus, Lylah's new salary can be expressed as:

   \[
   \text{Lylah's new salary} = L + xL = L(1 + x)
   \]

   We know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's salary four years ago, and now Adrien's salary is $56,000. So, we can express Lylah's new salary in terms of Adrien's new salary.

   Since Adrien's salary is 1.3 times Lylah's current salary, we have:

   \[
   56000 = L(1 + x) \times 1.3
   \]

   Substituting \( L \approx 30769.23 \):

   \[
   56000 = 30769.23(1 + x) \times 1.3
   \]

   Calculating \( 30769.23 \times 1.3 \):

   \[
   30769.23 \times 1.3 \approx 40000
   \]

   Therefore, we can simplify the equation:

   \[
   56000 = 40000(1 + x)
   \]

   Dividing both sides by 40000:

   \[
   \frac{56000}{40000} = 1 + x
   \]
   \[
   1.4 = 1 + x
   \]
   \[
   x = 0.4
   \]

   Thus, Lylah's salary also increased by 40%.

4. **Calculate Lylah's new salary:**
   Now we can calculate Lylah's new salary:

   \[
   \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 \times 1.4 \approx 43076.92
   \]

5. **Find the total salary four years later:**
   Now we can calculate the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later:

   \[
   \text{Total salary} = \text{Adrien's new salary} + \text{Lylah's new salary} = 56000 + 43076.92 \approx 99076.92

- Let \( q \) be the number of queen bees.
- Then, the number of baby bees \( b \) is \( 2q \) (since there are twice as many baby bees as queens).
- The number of worker bees \( w \) is \( 2b \) (since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees).

Now we can express the total number of bees in terms of \( q \):

1. The number of baby bees: \( b = 2q \)
2. The number of worker bees: \( w = 2b = 2(2q) = 4q \)

Now we can write the equation for the total number of bees:

\[

Substituting the expressions for \( b \) and \( w \):

This simplifies to:

2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28:

We can simplify the second equation:

   M - 2 = \frac{28}{2} + 5
   \]
5. Simplifying the right side:
   \[
   M - 2 = 14 + 5
   \]
   \[
   M - 2 = 19
   \]
6. Now, solving for \( M \):
   \[
   M = 19 + 2
   \]
   \[
   M = 21
   \]
7. Now that we have Mark's age, we can find Jean's age:
   \[
   J = M + 2 = 21 + 2 = 23
   \]

Thus, Jean is **23 years old**.",0.0052333499999999995,18.777270555496216,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_confidence,
gsm8k,gsm8k-183,TrustRoute,1,"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we first need to calculate the total time for each team.

**Team A (well-rounded team):**
- Each member runs their leg in 55 seconds.
- Total time for Team A = 4 members × 55 seconds/member = 220 seconds.

**Team B (less well-rounded team):**
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 seconds - 3 seconds = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 seconds - 3 seconds = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 seconds - 3 seconds = 51 seconds

Now, we calculate the total time for Team B:
- Total time for Team B = 60 seconds + 57 seconds + 54 seconds + 51 seconds
- Total time for Team B = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

Now we can find the difference in total time between the two teams:

gsm8k,gsm8k-186,TrustRoute,1,"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many rats are in each cage based on the distribution of straw.

1. **Identify the distribution of straw:**
   - Each rat receives 6 pieces of straw.
   - There are 3 cages of rats, and they are kept in equal groups.
   - Each hamster receives 5 pieces of straw, and there are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - A total of 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

2. **Calculate the total straw used for hamsters and rabbits:**
   - For the hamsters:
     - Total pieces of straw for hamsters = Number of hamsters × Straw per hamster
     - Let \( h \) be the number of hamsters in each cage. Then, the total number of hamsters = \( 10h \).
     - Total straw for hamsters = \( 10h \times 5 = 50h \).

   - For the rabbits:
     - Total straw for rabbits = 20 pieces.

3. **Set up the equation for total straw:**
   - The total straw distributed among all rodents is given as 160 pieces.
   - Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     \text{Straw for rats} + \text{Straw for hamsters} + \text{Straw for rabbits} = 160
     \]
   - The straw for rats can be expressed as:
     - Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage. Then, the total number of rats = \( 3r \).
     - Total straw for rats = \( 3r \times 6 = 18r \).

   - Now substituting into the equation:
     \[
     18r + 50h + 20 = 160
     \]

4. **Simplify the equation:**
   \[
   18r + 50h = 160 - 20
   \]
   \[
   18r + 50h = 140
   \]

5. **Solve for \( r \) and \( h \):**
   - Rearranging gives:
   \[
   18r = 140 - 50h
   \]
   \[
   r = \frac{140 - 50h}{18}
   \]

   Since \( r \) must be a whole number, \( 140 - 50h \) must be divisible by 18. We can test integer values for \( h \) to find suitable values for \( r \).

6. **Testing values for \( h \):**
   - If \( h = 0 \):
     \[
     r = \frac{140 - 50 \times 0}{18} = \frac{140}{18} \approx 7.78 \quad (\text{not an integer})
     \]
   - If \( h = 1 \):
     \[
     r = \frac{140 - 50 \times 1}{18} = \frac{90}{18} = 5 \quad (\text{integer})
     \]
   - If \( h = 2 \):
     \[
     r = \frac{140 - 50 \times 2}{18} = \frac{40}{18} \approx 2.22 \quad (\text{not an integer})
     \]
   - If \( h = 3 \):
     \[
     r = \frac{140 - 50 \times 3}{18} = \frac{-10}{18} \quad (\text{not valid})
     \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   The only valid solution is when \( h = 1 \) and \( r = 5 \).

Thus, the number of rats in each cage is \( \boxed{5} \).",0.00299635,24.79415488243103,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,
gsm8k,gsm8k-187,TrustRoute,1,"To calculate how much Mandy should pay Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can use the formula for compound interest:

\[ A = P(1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n months, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (as a decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of months the money is borrowed.

In this case:
- \( P = 100 \) (the amount owed)
- \( r = 0.02 \) (2% interest rate)
- \( n = 3 \) (the number of months)
