1. **Calculate the total investment**: This includes the purchase price of the house and the cost of repairs.
   \[
   \text{Total Investment} = \text{Purchase Price} + \text{Repair Costs} = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000

2. **Calculate the increased value of the house**: The value of the house increased by 150%. To find the new value, we first calculate 150% of the original purchase price.
   \[
   \text{Increase in Value} = 150\% \times \text{Purchase Price} = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000

### Step 1: Understand the problem
- Kyle paid $19.50 after a 25% discount.
- A 25% discount means he paid 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

### Step 2: Set up the equation
- Let the original price be \( P \).
- 75% of \( P \) equals $19.50.
- In mathematical terms: \( 0.75 \times P = 19.50 \).

### Step 3: Solve for \( P \)

- Apples: 4 apples at $1.50 each = 4 × $1.50 = $6

1. The first friend guesses **80** jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses **20 more than half the first one**:
   - Half of the first guess: \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \)
   - Adding 20: \( 40 + 20 = 60 \)
   - So, the second friend's guess is **60** jelly beans.
3. The third friend guesses **25% more than the first one**:
   - 25% of the first guess: \( 0.25 \times 80 = 20 \)
   - Adding this to the first guess: \( 80 + 20 = 100 \)
   - So, the third friend's guess is **100** jelly beans.

Now, we have the three guesses:
- First friend: 80
- Second friend: 60
- Third friend: 100

Next, we calculate the average of these guesses:

1. **Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry needs:**
   - Terry eats 2 yogurts per day.
   - Over 30 days, he needs:  
     \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) yogurts.

2. **Determine the cost of the yogurts:**
   - The yogurts are on sale at 4 for $5.00.
   - This means the cost per yogurt is:  
     \( \frac{5.00}{4} = 1.25 \) dollars per yogurt.
   - Alternatively, we can think in terms of packs:  
     60 yogurts can be divided into packs of 4:  
     \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) packs.
   - Each pack costs $5.00, so the total cost is:

   - John has 13 Lego sets and sells each for $15.
   - Total money from Lego sets = Number of Lego sets × Price per Lego set
   - Total money from Lego sets = 13 × $15 = $195

2. **Calculate the total money spent on video games:**
   - John buys 8 video games at $20 each.
   - Total money spent on video games = Number of video games × Price per video game
   - Total money spent on video games = 8 × $20 = $160

3. **Calculate the total money John has after buying video games:**
   - After buying the video games, John has $5 left.
   - Therefore, the total money he had before buying the video games = Money spent on video games + Money left
   - Total money before buying video games = $160 + $5 = $165

4. **Check if the calculations are consistent:**
   - The total money earned from selling Lego sets was $195, and he spent $160 on video games and has $5 left.
   - Total money = $160 (spent) + $5 (left) = $165, which is less than $195.
   - This indicates that he has enough money from selling Lego sets to cover the cost of the video games and still have $5 left.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - We know that Dana can skip at a speed of 3 miles per hour.
   - Since skipping is half as fast as running, we can find her running speed:
     \[
     \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 \text{ mph} = 6 \text{ mph}
     \]

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Dana runs at a speed four times faster than she walks. Therefore, we can express her walking speed as:
     \[
     \text{Walking speed} = \frac{\text{Running speed}}{4} = \frac{6 \text{ mph}}{4} = 1.5 \text{ mph}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time spent on each activity:**
   - Dana spends one-third of her time running and two-thirds of her time walking over a total of 6 hours.
   - Time spent running:
     \[
     \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Time spent walking:
     \[
     \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Calculate the distances traveled:**
   - Distance traveled while running:
     \[
     \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 6 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles}

Let L be the number of games lost.

We are given two pieces of information:
1.  The team played a total of 22 games. This means:
    W + L = 22

2.  They won 8 more games than they lost. This can be written as:
    W = L + 8

Now we have a system of two linear equations:
1) W + L = 22
2) W = L + 8

Substitute the second equation into the first equation:
(L + 8) + L = 22
2L + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

Let \( x \) represent the number of cookies Henry baked last year.

- Henry intended to bake twice as many as last year, so he planned to bake \( 2x \) cookies.
- However, he actually baked 15 more than he intended, so he baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.
- After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, leaving him with \( (2x + 15) - 5 \) cookies.
- We know he ended up with 110 cookies, so we can set up the equation:
  \[
  (2x + 15) - 5 = 110
  \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

- Simplify the left side: \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \)
- So, \( 2x + 10 = 110 \)
- Subtract 10 from both sides: \( 2x = 100 \)
- Divide both sides by 2: \( x = 50 \)

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

To verify:
- Twice as many as last year: \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) cookies intended.
- Actually baked: \( 100 + 15 = 115 \) cookies.

**Step 1: Find the distance to shore**
- It takes Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet
- The shore is 64 seconds away
- Distance to shore = (64 seconds) × (20 feet / 16 seconds) = 64 × 20/16 = 64 × 1.25 = 80 feet

**Step 2: Find how much water the boat takes on**
- The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed
- Julia needs to row 80 feet to reach shore
- Water taken on = (80 feet) × (2 liters / 10 feet) = 80 × 2/10 = 80 × 0.2 = 16 liters

*   Adrien's salary four years ago (A_old) = $40,000
*   Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's salary four years ago (L_old).
*   This means A_old = L_old + 0.30 * L_old = 1.30 * L_old
*   $40,000 = 1.30 * L_old
*   L_old = $40,000 / 1.30

*   Adrien's salary increased by 40% from what he was making four years ago.
*   Adrien's new salary (A_new) = A_old * (1 + 0.40)
*   A_new = $40,000 * 1.40
*   A_new = $56,000

**3. Calculate Lylah's salary four years later:**
*   The problem states: ""If Adrien's and Lylah's salary increased simultaneously"". Since no specific increase percentage is given for Lylah, the most reasonable assumption is that Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's, which is 40%.
*   Lylah's new salary (L_new) = L_old * (1 + 0.40)

### Step 1: Calculate the sheets used per week
- Miguel uses 2 pads of paper per week.
- Each pad has 30 sheets.
- Therefore, the total sheets used per week = 2 pads/week × 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets/week.

### Step 2: Determine the number of weeks in a month
- A month typically has about 4 weeks on average (this is an approximation, as months vary from 28 to 31 days).
- For this calculation, we'll use 4 weeks as a standard assumption unless a more specific month length is provided.

### Step 3: Calculate the sheets used per month
- Sheets used per month = Sheets per week × Number of weeks in a month.
- Sheets used per month = 60 sheets/week × 4 weeks = 240 sheets.

- Mark's rate: 5 questions per hour.
- First test: 75 questions, and he had 8 hours.
- Second test: 100 questions, and he had 6 hours.

### Step 1: Calculate for the first test
- In 8 hours, at a rate of 5 questions per hour, Mark completed:  
  \( 8 \times 5 = 40 \) questions.
- The test had 75 questions, so the number of questions left incomplete:  
  \( 75 - 40 = 35 \).

### Step 2: Calculate for the second test
- In 6 hours, at a rate of 5 questions per hour, Mark completed:  
  \( 6 \times 5 = 30 \) questions.
- The test had 100 questions, so the number of questions left incomplete:  
  \( 100 - 30 = 70 \).

Let B be the number of baby bees.
Let Q be the number of queen bees.

We are given the following information:
1.  Total bees: W + B + Q = 700
2.  Worker bees are twice as many as baby bees: W = 2B
3.  Baby bees are twice as many as queens: B = 2Q

We want to find the number of worker bees (W).

We can express everything in terms of one variable, for example, Q:
From (3): B = 2Q
Substitute B into (2): W = 2 * (2Q) => W = 4Q

Now substitute W and B (in terms of Q) into the total bees equation (1):
4Q + 2Q + Q = 700
7Q = 700
Q = 700 / 7
Q = 100

Now that we know the number of queen bees, we can find the number of baby bees:
B = 2Q = 2 * 100 = 200

Finally, we can find the number of worker bees:
W = 2B = 2 * 200 = 400

Let's check our answer:
Worker bees (W) = 400
Baby bees (B) = 200
Queen bees (Q) = 100
Total bees = 400 + 200 + 100 = 700. This matches the given total.

### Step 1: Bees leaving in the first 6 hours
- Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.

### Step 2: Bees returning in the next 6 hours (hours 7-12)
- She sees 1/2 of the bees that left in the first 6 hours return.
- 1/2 of 30 is 15 bees.
- So, 15 bees return in hours 7-12.
- Bees that left in the first 6 hours and haven't returned yet: 30 - 15 = 15 bees.

### Step 3: Bees leaving in the next 6 hours (hours 13-18)
- She sees two times as many bees as she saw leave in the first 6 hours.
- Two times 30 is 60 bees.
- So, 60 bees leave in hours 13-18.
- These 60 bees haven't returned yet.

### Step 4: Bees returning in the last 6 hours (hours 19-24)
- Every bee that left before this period (i.e., in hours 1-6 or hours 13-18) and hadn't already returned returns.
- From hours 1-6: 15 bees hadn't returned (as calculated in Step 2).
- From hours 13-18: All 60 bees hadn't returned.

**Blake's Distance:**
Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard football field. Each back-and-forth trip consists of running 100 yards to one end and then 100 yards back to the starting point, which totals 200 yards per trip.

So, for 15 trips:
\[
\text{Distance Blake runs} = 15 \times 200 \text{ yards} = 3000 \text{ yards}
\]

**Kelly's Distance:**
Kelly runs back and forth once on the 100-yard field, which is:
\[
\text{Distance for 1 back-and-forth trip} = 200 \text{ yards}
\]

After that, she runs to the 40-yard line and back. The distance to the 40-yard line is 40 yards, and the return trip is also 40 yards, totaling:

Kelly does this 34 times, so:
\[

gsm8k,gsm8k-183,TrustRoute,1,"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we first need to calculate the total time taken by each team.

**Team A (well-rounded team):**
- Each member runs their 400 meter leg in 55 seconds.
- Total time for Team A = 4 members × 55 seconds/member = 220 seconds.

**Team B (less well-rounded team):**
- The first runner runs their leg in 60 seconds.
- The second runner runs 3 seconds faster, so they run in 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
- The third runner runs 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run in 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
- The fourth runner runs 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run in 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Now, we calculate the total time for Team B:
- Total time for Team B = 60 seconds + 57 seconds + 54 seconds + 51 seconds
- Total time for Team B = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

**Now, we compare the total times:**
- Team A's total time = 220 seconds.
- Team B's total time = 222 seconds.

**To find out how many seconds Team A wins by:**

gsm8k,gsm8k-186,TrustRoute,1,"To find out how many rats are in each cage, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the total straw used for each type of rodent:**
   - Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage.
   - There are 3 cages of rats, so the total number of rats is \( 3r \).
   - Each rat receives 6 pieces of straw, so the total straw used for rats is:
     \[
     \text{Straw for rats} = 3r \times 6 = 18r
     \]

2. **Calculate the straw used for hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster receives 5 pieces of straw.
   - Let \( h \) be the number of hamsters in each cage.
   - The total number of hamsters is \( 10h \).
   - The total straw used for hamsters is:
     \[
     \text{Straw for hamsters} = 10h \times 5 = 50h
     \]

3. **Calculate the straw used for rabbits:**
   - The problem states that 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

4. **Set up the equation for total straw:**
   - The total straw distributed among all rodents is given as 160 pieces. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     18r + 50h + 20 = 160
     \]

5. **Simplify the equation:**
   \[
   18r + 50h = 160 - 20
   \]
   \[
   18r + 50h = 140
   \]

6. **Solve for \( r \) and \( h \):**
   - Rearranging gives:
     \[
     18r = 140 - 50h
     \]
   - To find integer solutions, we can try different values for \( h \) (the number of hamsters in each cage) and see if \( r \) results in a whole number.

   Let's try \( h = 0 \):
   \[
   18r = 140 \implies r = \frac{140}{18} \approx 7.78 \quad (\text{not an integer})
   \]

   Try \( h = 1 \):
   \[
   18r = 140 - 50 \implies 18r = 90 \implies r = \frac{90}{18} = 5 \quad (\text{integer})
   \]

   Try \( h = 2 \):
   \[
   18r = 140 - 100 \implies 18r = 40 \implies r = \frac{40}{18} \approx 2.22 \quad (\text{not an integer})
   \]

   Try \( h = 3 \):
   \[
   18r = 140 - 150 \implies 18r = -10 \quad (\text{not possible})

gsm8k,gsm8k-187,TrustRoute,1,"To calculate how much Mandy owes Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can use the formula for compound interest:

\[ A = P(1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n months, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (as a decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of months the money is borrowed.

In this case:
- \( P = 100 \) (the amount Mandy owes)
- \( r = 0.02 \) (2% interest rate)
- \( n = 3 \) (the number of months)

Now, we can substitute the values into the formula:

\[ A = 100(1 + 0.02)^3 \]

Calculating step by step:

1. Calculate \( 1 + 0.02 = 1.02 \).
2. Raise \( 1.02 \) to the power of 3:

1. **Let \( x \) be the number of bags sold.**

2. **Calculate the total cost for the trader:**
   - The cost of buying the bags: \( 20x \) (since each bag costs $20).
   - The cost of transporting the bags: \( 2x \) (since it costs $2 to transport each bag).
   - Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:
