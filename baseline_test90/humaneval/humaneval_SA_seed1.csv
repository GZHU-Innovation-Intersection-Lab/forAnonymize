humaneval,HumanEval/84,SA,1,"To solve the problem of summing the digits of a positive integer \( N \) and then converting that sum to its binary representation, we can follow these steps:

1. Convert the integer \( N \) to a string to easily iterate over each digit.
2. Convert each character back to an integer and sum them up.
3. Convert the resulting sum to binary format using Python's built-in `bin()` function, which returns the binary string prefixed with '0b'. We will slice the string to remove the '0b' prefix.
4. Return the binary string.

Here's the complete code for the `solve` function:

humaneval,HumanEval/119,SA,1,"To determine if two strings of parentheses can be concatenated in some order to form a balanced string, we can follow these steps:

1. Count the number of open `(` and close `)` parentheses in each string.
2. Check if the total counts of open and close parentheses can result in a balanced string when concatenated.
3. Ensure that at no point in the concatenated string do we have more closing parentheses than opening parentheses.

Here's the implementation of the function:

```python
def match_parens(lst):
    # Extract the two strings
    s1, s2 = lst[0], lst[1]
    
    # Function to count the open and close parentheses
    def count_parens(s):
        open_count = s.count('(')
        close_count = s.count(')')

# Test cases
print(match_parens(['()(', ')']))  # Output: 'Yes'
print(match_parens([')', ')']))     # Output: 'No'
```

### Explanation:
- We define a helper function `count_parens` to count the number of open and close parentheses in each string.
- We check both possible concatenation orders (`s1 + s2` and `s2 + s1`):
  - For each order, we ensure that the total number of opening parentheses is at least equal to the total number of closing parentheses.
  - Additionally, we ensure that when adding the second string, the total number of opening parentheses at that point is sufficient to match the closing parentheses introduced by the second string.
- If either order allows for a balanced string, we return 'Yes'; otherwise, we return 'No'.",0.0003223499999999,4.417623281478882,217,483,gpt-4o-mini,,

2. If two numbers have the same number of `1`s, sort them based on their decimal values (also in ascending order).

Here's how we can implement this in Python:

print(sort_array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

### Explanation:
- We use the `sorted()` function to sort the array.
- The `key` argument is a lambda function that returns a tuple for each element `x`:
  - The first element of the tuple is `bin(x).count('1')`, which counts the number of `1`s in the binary representation of `x`.
  - The second element is `x` itself, which allows us to sort by the decimal value if the number of `1`s is the same.
- This results in a sorted list according to the specified criteria.

### Explanation:
1. **Initial Checks**: The function first handles numbers less than or equal to 1 (which are not prime) and then checks small prime numbers (2 and 3).
2. **Even and Divisible by 3**: It checks if the number is divisible by 2 or 3, which are the first two prime numbers.
3. **Loop for Larger Factors**: It uses a loop starting from 5, checking potential factors up to the square root of `n`. The loop increments by 6 (i.e., checks i and i + 2) since all prime numbers greater than 3 can be expressed in the form of 6k ± 1.
4. **Return Value**: The function returns `True` if `n` is prime and `False` otherwise.

                stones.append(stones[-1] + 2)

    return stones
```

### Explanation:
1. The function initializes an empty list `stones` to hold the number of stones in each level.
2. It iterates `n` times to fill in the levels:
   - On the first iteration (`i == 0`), it appends `n` to the list.
   - For subsequent levels, it calculates the next stone count based on whether `n` is odd or even, always adding `2` to the last level's stone count.
3. Finally, it returns the list of stones for each level.

### Examples:
- `make_a_pile(3)` returns `[3, 5, 7]`
- `make_a_pile(4)` returns `[4, 6, 8, 10]`

We will collect each separate group of balanced parentheses in a list and return that list at the end. Here is the implementation of the `separate_paren_groups` function:

```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:

### Explanation:

1. **Remove Spaces**: We first remove any spaces from the input string to handle cases where spaces might interfere with parsing.

2. **Initialize Variables**:
   - `groups`: A list to store the separated groups of parentheses.
   - `current_group`: A list to accumulate characters of the current group.
   - `balance`: An integer to keep track of the balance of parentheses.

3. **Iterate Through the String**:
   - For each character in the string:
     - If it is an `'('`, increment the `balance` and add it to the `current_group`.
     - If it is a `')'`, decrement the `balance` and add it to the `current_group`.
     - When `balance` reaches zero, it indicates a complete group, so we join the `current_group` into a string and add it to `groups`, then reset `current_group`.

4. **Return the Result**: Finally, we return the list of groups.

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing `min_sum` to infinity to ensure that any sum we calculate will be smaller. We also initialize `current_sum` to zero, which will hold the sum of the current subarray.

2. **Iterate through the array**: For each number in `nums`, we add it to `current_sum`.

3. **Update minimum**: After updating `current_sum`, we check if it's the smallest sum we've seen so far by comparing it to `min_sum`.

4. **Reset current_sum**: If `current_sum` becomes positive, we reset it to zero. This is because continuing with a positive sum would not help in finding a smaller sum in the subsequent elements.

5. **Return the result**: Finally, we return the `min_sum`, which contains the minimum sum of any non-empty subarray.

### Explanation:
1. **Function Definition**: The `tri` function takes a non-negative integer `n` as input.
2. **Helper Function**: Inside `tri`, we define a helper function `tri_helper(k)` to compute the Tribonacci number based on the rules provided.
3. **Base Case**: If `k` is 1, it returns 3.
4. **Even Case**: If `k` is even, it calculates `1 + k / 2`.
5. **Odd Case**: If `k` is odd, it recursively calculates the sum of `tri_helper(k - 1)`, `tri_helper(k - 2)`, and `tri_helper(k + 1)`.
6. **Sequence Generation**: The loop runs from 0 to `n` and calls `tri_helper` for each value to build the sequence.
7. **Return**: Finally, the constructed list of Tribonacci numbers is returned.

### Explanation:
1. The function takes two lists: `game` (actual scores) and `guess` (predicted scores).
2. It uses a list comprehension combined with `zip` to iterate over both lists simultaneously.
3. For each score and guess, it calculates the absolute difference using `abs(g - score)`.
4. It returns a new list containing these absolute differences, with `0` indicating a correct guess.

humaneval,HumanEval/41,SA,1,"To determine the number of collisions between two sets of cars moving in opposite directions, we can analyze the problem logically.

Given that:
- There are `n` cars moving from left to right.
- There are `n` cars moving from right to left.
- Each car continues on its path regardless of collisions, essentially treating them as if they passed through one another.

Since each car in the left-to-right set will collide with each car in the right-to-left set, the total number of collisions can be calculated as follows:

1. Each of the `n` left-to-right cars will collide with each of the `n` right-to-left cars.

### Explanation of the Code:
- We first check if the array is empty, in which case we return `True`.
- We create a new array `double_arr` by concatenating `arr` with itself.
- We then iterate through each index of the original array and check the subarray of length `N` starting from that index.
- For each subarray, we use a generator expression with `all()` to check if it is sorted.
- If we find a sorted subarray, we return `True`; if no sorted subarray is found after checking all, we return `False`.",0.00036195,5.126326322555542,353,515,gpt-4o-mini,,
humaneval,HumanEval/56,SA,1,"To solve the problem of checking whether every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in a string of `<` and `>`, we can use a counter to track the balance of brackets. Here's how we can implement this:

1. Initialize a counter to zero.
2. Iterate through each character in the string:
   - Increment the counter for each `<`.
   - Decrement the counter for each `>`.
3. If at any point the counter becomes negative, it means there are more closing brackets than opening brackets, and we should return `False`.
4. At the end of the iteration, if the counter is zero, return `True`, indicating that the brackets are properly balanced. If the counter is not zero, return `False`.

Here's the implementation in Python:

```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:
    """"""Check if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

    Args:
        brackets (str): A string of ""<"" and "">"".

    Returns:
        bool: True if the brackets are correctly balanced, False otherwise.

    Examples:
        >>> correct_bracketing(""<"")
        False
        >>> correct_bracketing(""<>"")
        True
        >>> correct_bracketing(""<<><>>"")
        True
        >>> correct_bracketing(""><<>"")
        False

    counter = 0

humaneval,HumanEval/65,SA,1,"To implement the `circular_shift` function, we need to handle the following requirements:

1. Convert the integer `x` to a string to manipulate its digits.

   - If `shift` is less than the number of digits, perform the shift.

### Explanation:
- We first convert `x` to a string to easily access its digits.
- We check if the `shift` value is greater than or equal to the number of digits. If it is, we return the reverse of the string.
- If the `shift` is valid, we calculate the effective shift using the modulus operator to ensure we do not exceed the length of the string.

### Explanation:
1. **Base Cases**: We handle the base cases directly. For `n` values from 0 to 3, we return the predefined results.
2. **Iterative Calculation**: For `n >= 4`, we use a list `fib` to keep track of the last four computed values. We calculate the next value in the sequence by summing the last four values.
3. **Updating Values**: After computing the next value, we update the `fib` list to discard the oldest value and include the newly computed value.
4. **Return Result**: Finally, we return the last value in the `fib` list, which corresponds to `fib4(n)`.

This approach is efficient and runs in O(n) time complexity with O(1) additional space complexity.",0.0003842999999999,8.483675479888916,222,585,gpt-4o-mini,,
humaneval,HumanEval/96,SA,1,"To solve the problem of generating a list of prime numbers less than a given non-negative integer `n`, we can follow these steps:

1. **Check for Prime Numbers**: We need a helper function to determine if a number is prime. A prime number is greater than 1 and has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
2. **Iterate and Collect Primes**: We will iterate through numbers starting from 2 up to `n-1`, checking each number to see if it is prime. If it is, we will add it to our result list.
3. **Return the List**: Finally, return the list of prime numbers.

### Explanation:
- The function `is_odd_digit` checks if a given digit is odd.
- We iterate over each number in the input list `nums`.
- For each number, we check if it is greater than 10.
- If it is, we convert the number to a string to easily access the first and last digits.
- We convert these characters back to integers and check if both are odd using the `is_odd_digit` function.
- If all conditions are satisfied, we increment the `count`.
- Finally, we return the total count of qualifying numbers.",0.00024885,5.015955924987793,171,372,gpt-4o-mini,,
humaneval,HumanEval/110,SA,1,"To solve the problem of determining whether it's possible to exchange elements between two lists to make all elements of the first list even, we can follow these steps:

2. Iterate through the string, checking each substring of three consecutive characters.
3. For each substring, convert it to a set and check if its length is 3 (which means all characters are distinct).

3. Whenever we encounter an opening parenthesis '(', we increase the counter, and when we encounter a closing parenthesis ')', we decrease it.
4. Keep track of the maximum depth encountered during this traversal for each group.
5. Collect the maximum depths for all groups and return them as a list.

### Explanation:
- The `factorial` function computes the factorial of a given number.
- The `f` function constructs a list by iterating from 1 to `n`, checking if the current index is even or odd, and appending the corresponding value to the result list.

humaneval,HumanEval/121,SA,1,"To solve the problem of summing all odd elements that are in even positions of a given list, we will follow these steps:

1. Loop through the list using the index so that we can identify both the position (even or odd) and the value of each element.
2. Check if the index is even (0, 2, 4, ...).
3. If the index is even, check if the element at that position is odd.
4. If both conditions are satisfied, add the element to a running total.
5. Return the total sum after processing all elements in the list.

Here's the implementation of the `solution` function:

```python

    """"""Given a non-empty list of integers, return the sum of all of the odd elements that are in even positions.""""""

print(solution([3, 3, 3, 3, 3]))  # Output: 9
print(solution([30, 13, 24, 321]))  # Output: 0
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We initialize `total` to 0 to keep track of the sum of the odd elements at even positions.
- We use a `for` loop to iterate through the indices of the list.
- The condition `index % 2 == 0` checks if the index is even, and `lst[index] % 2 != 0` checks if the element at that index is odd.
- If both conditions are true, we add the element to `total`.
- Finally, we return the total sum after processing all elements. 

The provided test cases will yield the expected outputs as described in the function's docstring.",0.0002791499999999,4.179183483123779,149,428,gpt-4o-mini,,

### Explanation:
1. **Helper Function**: `sum_of_digits(n)` calculates the sum of the digits of the number `n` by converting it to a string (using `str(abs(n))` to handle negative numbers) and summing the integer values of each character.

2. **Sorting**: The `sorted()` function is used to sort the `nums` list. The key for sorting is a tuple:
   - The first element is the sum of the digits (calculated using `sum_of_digits(x)`).
   - The second element is the index of the number in the original list (`nums.index(x)`), which preserves the original order in case of ties.

### Explanation:
1. **Removing Duplicates**: We first convert the list to a set to remove duplicate values, ensuring that we only consider distinct elements.
2. **Triple Nested Loop**: We use three nested loops to iterate through all combinations of three distinct elements in the list.
3. **Checking Sum**: For each combination, we check if the sum equals zero. If we find such a combination, we return `True`.
4. **Return False**: If no combination sums to zero, we return `False`.

### Explanation:
1. **Polynomial Evaluation**: The `poly` function calculates the value of the polynomial at a given point `x` using the coefficients provided in the list `xs`.

2. **Finding Bounds**: The `find_zero` function starts by defining initial bounds for the search. It checks for a sign change in the polynomial values at these bounds. If no sign change is found, the bounds are doubled until one is found.

3. **Bisection Method**: The function then uses the bisection method to narrow down the interval where the root lies until the interval is smaller than a specified tolerance.

4. **Return Value**: Finally, it returns the midpoint of the last interval as the root of the polynomial. 

This implementation should correctly find one root for the given polynomial coefficients.",0.0004865999999999,14.55152678489685,312,733,gpt-4o-mini,,

humaneval,HumanEval/73,SA,1,"To solve the problem of finding the minimum number of changes needed to make an array palindromic, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the properties of a palindrome**: A palindromic array reads the same forwards and backwards. Therefore, for an element at index `i`, it should equal the element at index `n - 1 - i`, where `n` is the length of the array.

2. **Count mismatches**: We can iterate through the first half of the array and compare each element with its corresponding element from the end of the array. Each time we find a mismatch, we will increment a counter.

3. **Return the counter**: The value of the counter at the end of the iteration will give us the minimum number of changes needed.

Here is the implementation of the above logic:

```python
def smallest_change(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    changes = 0
    
    # Compare elements from start and end moving towards the center

print(smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]))            # Output: 0

- We initialize a counter `changes` to zero.
- We loop through the first half of the array. For each index `i`, we check if the element at `i` is equal to the element at `n - 1 - i`.

humaneval,HumanEval/129,SA,1,"To solve the problem of finding the minimum path of length `k` in a grid, we can use Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore all possible paths starting from each cell. Since the grid is small and we can move to neighboring cells, we can implement the search recursively. We'll keep track of the current path and update the best path whenever we find a lexicographically smaller path of the required length `k`.

Here's a Python implementation of the `minPath` function:

```python
def minPath(grid, k):
    from collections import deque
    
    # Get grid dimensions
    n = len(grid)
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    
    # To store the best path found
    best_path = None
    
    def dfs(x, y, path):
        nonlocal best_path
        
        # If the path length is equal to k
        if len(path) == k:
            # Compare with the best_path
            if best_path is None or path < best_path:
                best_path = path[:]
            return
        
        # Explore neighbors
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n:
                # Add the next cell value to the path and continue DFS
                path.append(grid[nx][ny])
                dfs(nx, ny, path)
                path.pop()  # Backtrack
    
    # Start DFS from every cell in the grid

        for j in range(n):
            dfs(i, j, [grid[i][j]])
    
    return best_path

# Example usage:
grid1 = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
k1 = 3
print(minPath(grid1, k1))  # Output: [1, 2, 1]

grid2 = [[5, 9, 3], [4, 1, 6], [7, 8, 2]]
k2 = 1
print(minPath(grid2, k2))  # Output: [1]
```

### Explanation:

1. **Grid Traversal**: We define possible movements in four directions (up, down, left, right).
2. **DFS Function**: The `dfs` function takes the current cell coordinates `(x, y)` and the current path. If the current path length equals `k`, we compare it to the `best_path` and update if it's lexicographically smaller.
3. **Backtracking**: After exploring each direction, we backtrack by removing the last added cell value from the path.
4. **Starting DFS**: We initiate the DFS from every cell in the grid to ensure all potential paths are explored.
5. **Return**: Finally, we return the `best_path` found.

humaneval,HumanEval/63,SA,1,"To compute the n-th element of the FibFib number sequence efficiently, we can use an iterative approach instead of a recursive one. This will help us avoid the excessive function calls that can occur with recursion, especially for larger values of `n`. Here’s the implementation of the `fibfib` function:

```python
def fibfib(n: int) -> int:
    """"""Compute the n-th FibFib number.""""""
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:

    print(fibfib(1))  # Output: 0
    print(fibfib(5))  # Output: 4
    print(fibfib(8))  # Output: 24

### Explanation:
1. **Base Cases**:
   - When `n` is 0, return 0.
   - When `n` is 1, return 0.
   - When `n` is 2, return 1.

2. **Iterative Calculation**:
   - We store the first three values in a list `fibfib_values`.
   - For `n >= 3`, we calculate the next value as the sum of the previous three values and continue appending to the list until we reach `n`.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - Finally, we return the value at index `n` from the list.

This approach ensures that we compute the values in linear time \(O(n)\) and use \(O(n)\) space for storing the intermediate results.",0.0002956499999999,4.2170515060424805,199,443,gpt-4o-mini,,
humaneval,HumanEval/125,SA,1,"To implement the function `split_words` according to the specified requirements, we will follow these steps:

1. Check if there are any whitespace characters in the input string. If so, we will split the string using whitespace.
2. If no whitespace is found, check if there are commas. If there are, we will split the string using commas.
3. If neither whitespace nor commas are found, we will count the number of lowercase letters in the string that have an odd position in the alphabet (i.e., `b`, `d`, `f`, ..., `z`).

Here's the implementation of the `split_words` function:

```python
def split_words(txt):
    # Check for whitespace

```

### Explanation:
- The function first checks for spaces in the input string. If found, it uses the `split()` method to split the string and return a list of words.
- If no whitespace is found, it checks for commas and splits the string accordingly.
- If neither is found, it iterates through each character in the string, checking if it is a lowercase letter and if its position in the alphabet (calculated using `ord()`) is odd. The count of such letters is returned.",0.0002819999999999,8.027523756027222,192,422,gpt-4o-mini,,

humaneval,HumanEval/83,SA,1,"To solve the problem of counting the n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1, we'll need to consider two cases:

1. **Numbers that start with 1**: For an n-digit number starting with 1, the first digit is fixed as 1, and we have \( n-1 \) remaining digits. Each of these \( n-1 \) digits can be anything from 0 to 9, giving us \( 10^{(n-1)} \) possibilities.

2. **Numbers that end with 1**: For an n-digit number ending with 1, the last digit is fixed as 1. The first digit cannot be 0 (since we want n-digit numbers), so the first digit can be anything from 1 to 9 (giving us 9 options), and the remaining \( n-2 \) digits can be anything from 0 to 9. Thus, we have \( 9 \times 10^{(n-2)} \) possibilities for this case.

3. **Adjustment for double counting**: If a number starts and ends with 1, we have counted it in both of the previous cases. The count of n-digit numbers that both start and end with 1 is \( 10^{(n-2)} \) (the first digit is 1, the last digit is 1, and the \( n-2 \) middle digits can be anything from 0 to 9).

Now, we can combine these counts using the principle of inclusion-exclusion:

- Count of numbers starting with 1: \( 10^{(n-1)} \)
- Count of numbers ending with 1: \( 9 \times 10^{(n-2)} \)
- Count of numbers starting and ending with 1 (to subtract): \( 10^{(n-2)} \)

The final formula becomes:

\[
\text{Total count} = 10^{(n-1)} + 9 \times 10^{(n-2)} - 10^{(n-2)}
\]

Now, we can implement this logic in the function:

humaneval,HumanEval/154,SA,1,"To solve the problem of checking if one word or any of its rotations is a substring of another word, we can utilize the following approach:

1. **Generate Rotations**: Instead of generating all rotations of the second word, we can concatenate the second word with itself. This way, all possible rotations will be present as substrings in the concatenated string.
2. **Check for Substring**: We can then check if the first word contains any of these rotations by simply checking if the first word is a substring of the concatenated string.

Here's the implementation of the `cycpattern_check` function based on this logic:

```python
def cycpattern_check(a, b):
    """"""Check if the second word or any of its rotations is a substring in the first word.""""""
    # Concatenate the second word with itself to get all rotations
    b_rotations = b + b

### Explanation:
- When we concatenate `b` with itself (`b + b`), we create a string that includes all possible rotations of `b`.
- Then, we simply check if `a` is a substring of this new string. If it is, we return `True`; otherwise, we return `False`. 

This method is efficient and concise, allowing us to easily determine the presence of any rotation of `b` within `a`.",0.0002710499999999,5.142858505249023,179,407,gpt-4o-mini,,

```

### Explanation:
- The function begins by checking if `n` is a positive integer.
- It then initializes an empty list `collatz_sequence` to store the terms of the sequence.
- We use a loop to generate the Collatz sequence until we reach 1. Depending on whether the current number is odd or even, we apply the corresponding rule to calculate the next number.
- After constructing the entire sequence, we filter out the odd numbers using a list comprehension and sort them before returning the final list.",0.00028155,14.799663305282593,285,398,gpt-4o-mini,,
humaneval,HumanEval/44,SA,1,"To implement the `change_base` function, we need to convert a given integer `x` to a specified base `base`, where the base is less than 10. The function will repeatedly divide the number by the base and track the remainders to build the resulting string, which represents the number in the new base.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def change_base(x: int, base: int) -> str:
    """"""Change numerical base of input number x to base.
    return string representation after the conversion.
    base numbers are less than 10.
    >>> change_base(8, 3)
    '22'
    >>> change_base(8, 2)
    '1000'
    >>> change_base(7, 2)
    '111'
    """"""
    if base < 2 or base >= 10:
        raise ValueError(""Base must be between 2 and 9 (inclusive)."")
    
    if x == 0:
        return '0'
    
    result = []
    negative = x < 0
    x = abs(x)

    while x > 0:
        remainder = x % base
        result.append(str(remainder))
        x //= base

    if negative:
        result.append('-')
    
    return ''.join(reversed(result))

# Example usage and test cases
if __name__ == ""__main__"":

    print(change_base(8, 2))  # Output: '1000'
    print(change_base(7, 2))  # Output: '111'
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Validation**: The function checks if the base is valid (between 2 and 9).
2. **Zero Case**: If the input number `x` is 0, it directly returns '0'.
3. **Conversion Logic**: It uses a loop to divide `x` by `base`, collecting remainders. The remainders represent the digits in the new base.
4. **Negative Handling**: If `x` is negative, it adds a '-' sign to the result.
5. **Result Construction**: The collected digits are reversed to form the correct base representation and then joined into a single string to return.

1. **Replace commas with spaces**: The `replace(',', ' ')` method replaces all commas in the string with spaces so that we can treat both commas and spaces as delimiters.
2. **Split the string**: The `split()` method splits the modified string into words based on whitespace. By default, `split()` handles multiple spaces as well.

humaneval,HumanEval/147,SA,1,"To solve the problem of counting the number of valid triples \((a[i], a[j], a[k])\) such that \(i < j < k\) and the sum \(a[i] + a[j] + a[k]\) is a multiple of 3, we can follow these steps:

1. **Define the array**: Create the array \(a\) based on the formula \(a[i] = i^2 - i + 1\).
2. **Calculate remainders**: Since we are interested in whether the sum is a multiple of 3, we can compute the remainders of the elements in \(a\) when divided by 3.
3. **Count occurrences**: Count how many times each remainder (0, 1, 2) appears in the remainders list.

Here is the Python code implementing this logic:

- It calculates the minimum (`min_val`) and maximum (`max_val`) of the input list.
- If all elements are the same (i.e., `min_val` equals `max_val`), it returns a list of zeros (since all values will map to the same point).

- For each character in the string:
  - If it’s an opening bracket `'('`, we increment `balance`.
  - If it’s a closing bracket `')'`, we decrement `balance`.
  - If `balance` becomes negative at any point, it means there are more closing brackets than opening ones, so we return `False` immediately.

Here's how we can implement this:

```python

- In `make_palindrome`, we search for the longest palindromic suffix by iterating from the start of the string and checking each substring. The first palindromic suffix we find determines where we divide the string into a prefix and a suffix.

humaneval,HumanEval/132,SA,1,"To solve the problem of determining whether a string of square brackets contains a valid subsequence with at least one nested bracket, we can use a stack-based approach.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. **Initialization**: Use a stack to keep track of opened brackets.
2. **Iterate through the string**: For each character in the string:
   - If it's an opening bracket `[`, push it onto the stack.
   - If it's a closing bracket `]`, check if there's a matching opening bracket in the stack:
     - If there is, pop the stack. 
     - If the stack is empty (indicating an unmatched closing bracket), we can ignore it.
3. **Check for nesting**: If at any point during the process we have more than one opening bracket without a matching closing bracket, it indicates nesting.
4. **Final check**: After processing the string, if the stack has at least two opening brackets, we have found a nested structure.

Here’s the implementation of the `is_nested` function:

```python
def is_nested(string):
    stack = []
    nested = False
    
    for char in string:
        if char == '[':
            stack.append(char)
            if len(stack) > 1:
                nested = True  # We found at least one nested bracket
        elif char == ']':
            if stack:
                stack.pop()
            else:
                return False  # Unmatched closing bracket
    
    return nested and len(stack) == 0  # Must be matched and nested

print(is_nested('[[][]]'))  # ➞ True
print(is_nested('[[]][['))  # ➞ True

### Explanation of the Code:
- We use a list `stack` to simulate the stack behavior for our brackets.
- The boolean variable `nested` is set to `True` if we ever have more than one opening bracket without a corresponding closing bracket.
- The final return checks that there is at least one nested structure (`nested` is `True`) and that all brackets are matched (`len(stack) == 0`).

### Explanation:
1. **Character Ordinal Value**: `ord(ch)` gives the ASCII value of the character.
2. **Shift Back**: Subtract 5 from the ordinal value to decode the character.
3. **Wrap Around the Alphabet**: The modulo operation ensures that if the result goes below 'a', it wraps around to the end of the alphabet.
4. **Reconstructing the String**: Using `join` to concatenate the decoded characters back into a string.

### Complete Code Example:
Here’s the complete code with both encoding and decoding functions:

```python
def encode_shift(s: str):
    """"""
    Returns encoded string by shifting every character by 5 in the alphabet.
    """"""

humaneval,HumanEval/127,SA,1,"To solve the problem of determining if the length of the intersection of two intervals is a prime number, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the intersection of the two intervals**: The intersection can be found by determining the maximum of the start points and the minimum of the end points.
2. **Determine the length of the intersection**: If the intersection is valid (i.e., the start of the intersection is less than or equal to the end), we can calculate the length.

humaneval,HumanEval/115,SA,1,"To solve the problem of determining how many times we need to lower buckets to empty the wells represented by the grid, we can follow these steps:

1. **Count the Total Units of Water**: Iterate through each row of the grid and count the number of `1`s, which represent units of water in the wells.

2. **Calculate the Number of Bucket Lowers**: For each unit of water, we need to lower a bucket. However, since each bucket has a specific capacity, we can divide the total units of water by the bucket capacity to determine how many full bucket lowers are needed. If there are any remaining units of water after using full buckets, that will require an additional lower.

3. **Return the Result**: The final count will be the total number of bucket lowers needed.

Here's how you can implement this in Python:

```python
def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    total_water = 0
    
    # Count total units of water in the grid
    for row in grid:
        total_water += sum(row)
    
    # Calculate the number of times we need to lower the buckets
    # Using the ceiling of total_water / capacity
    if total_water == 0:
        return 0  # No water to extract
    
    lowers_needed = math.ceil(total_water / capacity)
    
    return lowers_needed

# Example usage:
print(max_fill([[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]], 1))  # Output: 6
print(max_fill([[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]], 2))  # Output: 5
print(max_fill([[0,0,0], [0,0,0]], 5))  # Output: 0
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We initialize `total_water` to zero and iterate through each row of the grid, summing the values to count the units of water.
- After counting, we check if `total_water` is zero; if so, we return `0` since there is no water to extract.
- We then use `math.ceil(total_water / capacity)` to calculate the total number of times we need to lower the buckets, accounting for any remaining water that requires an additional lowering.
- Finally, we return the computed number of lowers needed.

2. Trim any trailing whitespace from the string to ensure we are checking the actual last character.
3. Find the last character of the trimmed string and check if it is an alphabetical character.

### Explanation of the Code:
- We first check if the input string `txt` is empty. If it is empty, we return `False`.
- We use `rstrip()` to remove any trailing spaces, ensuring we are only analyzing meaningful characters.
- We then get the last character of the trimmed string.
- We check if this last character is an alphabetical character using the `isalpha()` method.
- Finally, we check if the character before the last character is a space. If it is not (and there is indeed a character before it), it indicates that the last character is part of a word, and we return `False`.
