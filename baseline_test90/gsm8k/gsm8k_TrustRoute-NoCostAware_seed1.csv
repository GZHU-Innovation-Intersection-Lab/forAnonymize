1. **Weight of the chocolate bars**:
   - There are 25 chocolate bars.
   - Each chocolate bar weighs 40g.
   - Total weight of chocolate bars = Number of chocolate bars × Weight of each chocolate bar
   \[
   \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{g}
   \]

2. **Weight of the candied apples**:
   - We know that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. Therefore, the weight of each candied apple can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{\text{Weight of each chocolate bar}}{2} = \frac{40g}{2} = 20g

   - Half a dozen plates means \(6 / 2 = 3\) plates.
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 3 plates is:
     \[
     3 \times 6000 = 18000 \text{ dollars}

1. **Cost of the jacket**: $30
2. **Cost of each pair of shoes**: $20
3. **Total cost for 2 pairs of shoes**: \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \)

Now, let's find the total amount Sara needs to buy the jacket and the shoes:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of jacket} + \text{Cost of shoes} = 30 + 40 = 70
\]

Next, we calculate how much money Sara has after babysitting and her initial savings.

1. **Earnings from babysitting**: She babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings from babysitting} = 4 \times 5 = 20
   \]

2. **Total money Sara has after babysitting**:
   \[
   \text{Total money} = \text{Initial savings} + \text{Earnings from babysitting} = 10 + 20 = 30

gsm8k,gsm8k-211,TrustRoute-NoCostAware,1,"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The white chickens produce 5 eggs a day, and the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day. The total number of eggs collected daily is 42. This gives us the equation:
   \[
   3r + 5w = 42
   \]

2. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which gives us the equation:
   \[
   w = r + 2
   \]

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation. Replacing \( w \) in the first equation, we get:
\[
3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
\]

Expanding this equation:
\[
3r + 5r + 10 = 42
\]

Combining like terms:
\[
8r + 10 = 42
\]

Now, we can isolate \( r \) by subtracting 10 from both sides:
\[
8r = 32
\]

Dividing both sides by 8:
\[
r = 4
\]

Now that we have the number of red chickens, we can find the number of white chickens using the second equation:
\[
w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6
\]

Thus, Jerry has:
- Red chickens: \( r = 4 \)
- White chickens: \( w = 6 \)

To verify, we can check the total number of eggs produced:
- Eggs from red chickens: \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \)
- Eggs from white chickens: \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \)
- Total eggs: \( 12 + 30 = 42 \)

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of red chickens Jerry has is:

   - Water type: 40

2. **Adjust for Losses and Purchases**:
   - James loses 8 water type cards:

3. **Extra cheese**: $1.00
4. **Avocado**: $1.00
5. **Sauces**: 2 sauces at $0.25 each = 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
6. **Upgrade for chips and drink**: $3.00

Now, let's add all these costs together:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Base burrito} + \text{Extra meat} + \text{Extra cheese} + \text{Avocado} + \text{Sauces} + \text{Upgrade}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost} = 6.50 + 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 + 3.00

From the problem, we have the following two equations based on the information provided:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
   \[
   R = 6S
   \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
   \[
   R + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation. 

Substituting \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
\]

Now, simplify the right side:
\[
6S + 9 = 3S + 27
\]

Next, we can isolate \( S \) by moving all terms involving \( S \) to one side and constant terms to the other side:
\[
6S - 3S = 27 - 9
\]
\[
3S = 18
\]

Now, divide both sides by 3:

S = 6

So, Sam is currently **6 years old**.

To find Ruby's age, we can substitute \( S \) back into the first equation:

Thus, Ruby is currently **36 years old**.

To verify, in 9 years:
- Sam will be \( 6 + 9 = 15 \)

1. **Calculate the total rice consumption per meal for the household:**
   Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Therefore, for 5 members:
   \[
   \text{Total consumption per meal} = 5 \text{ members} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/member} = 1 \text{ kg/meal}

2. Six years ago, Cera's age was \( 46 - 6 = 40 \).
3. Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so six years ago Noah's age was \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).

According to the problem:

1. The number of players on the offense is \( 2d \) (twice as many as on defense).
2. The number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{d}{2} \) (half the number of players on defense).

The total number of members in the team is given as 105. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
d + 2d + \frac{d}{2} = 105
\]

Now, combine the terms on the left side:

\[
3d + \frac{d}{2} = 105
\]

To combine \( 3d \) and \( \frac{d}{2} \), we can express \( 3d \) as \( \frac{6d}{2} \):

\[
\frac{6d}{2} + \frac{d}{2} = 105
\]

Now, combine the fractions:

\[
\frac{6d + d}{2} = 105
\]

This simplifies to:

\[

   - Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.
   - The store initially had 50 marbles.
   - His father gave him \( \frac{2}{5} \) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna.

   First, calculate how many marbles his father gave him:
   \[
   \text{Marbles from father} = \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \text{ marbles}

To find \( x \), we can solve the equation:

\[

The total number of students in all three groups can be expressed as:

\[

\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2x + (x - 10) = 200
\]

Combining like terms gives:

\[

\]

Next, we add 10 to both sides:

\[

Now, we divide by 3:

Now that we have \( x \), we can find the number of students in the smallest group:

According to the problem, we have two equations:

1. The total number of animals:
   \[
   c + h = 60

2. The relationship between chickens and cows:
   \[
   h = 2c
   \]

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:

\[
c + 2c = 60
\]
\[
3c = 60
\]
\[
c = 20
\]

Now that we have the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:

\[

\]

So, Farmer Brown has 20 cows and 40 chickens.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each.

Calculating the total number of legs from cows:
\[

Calculating the total number of legs from chickens:
\[

     \text{Cost of gumballs} = 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate how much change Billy has after buying gumballs:**
   - Billy starts with $10.
   - He spends $2 on gumballs, so his remaining amount is:
     \[
     \text{Remaining amount} = 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Determine how much change he had before buying gumballs:**
   - Since he spent half of his change on gumballs, the total change he had before buying gumballs is:
     \[
     \text{Total change before gumballs} = 8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate how much Billy spent on candy:**
   - Since he started with $10 and had $16 before buying gumballs, the amount he spent on candy is:
     \[
     \text{Amount spent on candy} = 10 - 16 = -6 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - This indicates a mistake in our calculations. Let's re-evaluate the steps.

5. **Re-evaluate the change after buying candy:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount Billy spent on candy.
   - After buying candy, he has \( 10 - x \) dollars left.
   - He spends half of his remaining money on gumballs, which is:
     \[
     \frac{10 - x}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     10 - x = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 10 - 4 = 6 \text{ dollars}
     \]

6. **Calculate how many pounds of candy Billy bought:**
   - The cost of candy is $1.5 per pound. To find out how many pounds he bought, we can use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Pounds of candy} = \frac{\text{Amount spent on candy}}{\text{Cost per pound}} = \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \text{ pounds}
     \]

Thus, Billy bought **4 pounds of candy**.",0.0022391499999999,7.521871328353882,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,,1

According to the problem, the total number of popsicles they have together is 165. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

1. **Taffy Purchase:**
   - The price for 1 pound of taffy is $3.
   - The second pound is half off, so it costs $3 / 2 = $1.50.
   - Total cost for 2 pounds of taffy = $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

2. **Seashells Purchase:**
   - The mixed bag of seashells costs $1.50.

3. **Magnets Purchase:**

Now, let's calculate the total amount spent:

- Total spent on taffy: $4.50
- Total spent on seashells: $1.50
- Total spent on magnets: $1.00

Total amount spent = $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00.

From the problem, we know the following:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- She gathers half of that from the shortest trees, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
- Therefore, the total number of apples Joanne gathers is:
  \[
  30 + 15 + x = 45 + x

Now, let's analyze what her sister gathers:

- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- She gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- Her sister does not gather any apples from the average trees.

Thus, the total number of apples her sister gathers is:

Let:
- \( c \) = number of camels
- \( d \) = number of dromedaries

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. Each animal has one head, so the total number of heads gives us the equation:
   \[
   c + d = 180
   \]

2. Camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump. The total number of humps gives us the equation:
   \[
   2c + d = 304
   \]

Now we have the system of equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)  (Equation 1)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \)  (Equation 2)

We can solve this system step by step.

First, we can solve Equation 1 for \( d \):
\[
d = 180 - c
\]

Next, we substitute \( d \) in Equation 2:
\[
2c + (180 - c) = 304
\]

Now simplify the equation:

\]
\[
c + 180 = 304
\]
\[
c = 304 - 180

\[
c = 124

2. **Distance traveled in the next 2 days:**
   - He traveled a total of 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days.
   - 30% of 800 kilometers = 0.30 * 800 km = 240 kilometers.
   - Since this distance is over 2 days, the average distance per day for these 2 days is:
     - Distance per day = 240 km / 2 days = 120 kilometers/day.

3. **Distance traveled on the next day:**
   - On this day, he did not travel at all, so the distance is 0 kilometers.

4. **Distance traveled in the second week (the next 7 days):**

3. **Determine the time difference**:
   - Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. 
   - Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to arrive, he will arrive at the theater at 4 minutes after he leaves.

gsm8k,gsm8k-499,TrustRoute-NoCostAware,1,"To find the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up equations for the total cost of each venue based on the number of guests, \( x \).

1. **First Venue:**
   - Flat fee: $200
   - Food cost: $5 per person
   - Total cost for the first venue: 
     \[
     \text{Cost}_1 = 200 + 5x
     \]

2. **Second Venue:**
   - Cost per person (including food): $25
   - Total cost for the second venue:
     \[

     \]

Now, we need to find the value of \( x \) where the costs are equal:
\[
200 + 5x = 25x
\]

Next, we can solve for \( x \):

1. Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
   \[
   200 = 25x - 5x
   \]
   \[
   200 = 20x

2. Divide both sides by 20:

1. The total number of insects collected is:
   \[
   L + D + B = 43
   \]

2. Lily found 7 more insects than David:
   \[
   L = D + 7
   \]

3. David found half of what Bodhi found:
   \[
   D = \frac{1}{2}B
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( L \) and \( D \) into the first equation.

Substituting \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \) into \( L = D + 7 \):
\[
L = \frac{1}{2}B + 7
\]

Now substitute \( L \) and \( D \) into the total equation:
\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}B + 7\right) + \left(\frac{1}{2}B\right) + B = 43
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
\frac{1}{2}B + \frac{1}{2}B + B + 7 = 43
\]
\[
2B + 7 = 43
\]

Now, subtract 7 from both sides:
\[
2B = 36
\]

Divide by 2:
\[
B = 18
\]

Now that we have \( B \), we can find \( D \):
\[
D = \frac{1}{2}B = \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9
\]

Finally, we can find \( L \):
\[
L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16
\]

Thus, the number of insects that Lily found is:

gsm8k,gsm8k-524,TrustRoute-NoCostAware,1,"To determine how many rows of flowers Jackson will plant, we need to calculate the number of rows for both red and blue tulips separately.

1. **Calculate the number of rows for red tulips:**
   - Jackson has 36 red tulips.
   - He can fit 6 red tulips in a row.
   - The number of rows of red tulips is calculated by dividing the total number of red tulips by the number of tulips per row:
     \[
     \text{Number of rows of red tulips} = \frac{36 \text{ red tulips}}{6 \text{ tulips per row}} = 6 \text{ rows}

2. **Calculate the number of rows for blue tulips:**
   - Jackson has 24 blue tulips.
   - He can fit 8 blue tulips in a row.
   - The number of rows of blue tulips is calculated similarly:
     \[
     \text{Number of rows of blue tulips} = \frac{24 \text{ blue tulips}}{8 \text{ tulips per row}} = 3 \text{ rows}

According to the problem:

1. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs:
   \[
   S_O = C_O - 2
   \]
   where \( S_O \) is the number of sofas Ophelia has.

2. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia:
   \[
   C_J = 3C_O
   \]

3. Ophelia has 20 sofas:
   \[
   S_O = 20
   \]

From the first equation, we can substitute \( S_O \) with 20:
\[
20 = C_O - 2
\]

Now, solving for \( C_O \):
\[
C_O = 20 + 2 = 22
\]

Now that we have \( C_O \), we can find \( C_J \):
\[
C_J = 3C_O = 3 \times 22 = 66
\]

Next, we can find the number of sofas Jenna has. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs:
\[
S_J = C_J - 2 = 66 - 2 = 64
\]

Now we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs for both Ophelia and Jenna:

- Total sofas:
\[
S_O + S_J = 20 + 64 = 84
\]

- Total chairs:
\[
C_O + C_J = 22 + 66 = 88
\]

Finally, the total number of sofas and chairs combined is:
\[

gsm8k,gsm8k-568,TrustRoute-NoCostAware,1,"Let's denote the number of goals scored by Mark as \( M \) and the number of goals scored by Anna as \( A \).

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. Richie scored 80 goals.
2. Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark:
   \[
   80 = M + 20
   \]
   From this, we can solve for \( M \):
   \[
   M = 80 - 20 = 60
   \]

3. Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna:
   \[
   80 = A + 45

1. **Determine the daily spending amount**:
   Peter has $70 to spend over one week (7 days). Therefore, the amount he can spend each day is:
   \[
   \text{Daily spending} = \frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day}
   \]

2. **Calculate spending from Sunday through Wednesday**:
   From Sunday to Wednesday, there are 4 days. During these days, Peter spends his money on wooden action figures that cost $5 each. The total amount he spends over these 4 days is:
   \[
   \text{Total spending from Sunday to Wednesday} = 10 \text{ dollars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   Now, we can find out how many wooden action figures he buys:

- The number of green jelly beans is \( g = b + 0.01b = 1.01b \) (1% more than blue).

The total number of jelly beans in the jar is given as 4500. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
r + b + g = 4500
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( r \) and \( g \):

\[
0.99b + b + 1.01b = 4500
\]

Combining the terms:

\[
(0.99 + 1 + 1.01)b = 4500
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
3.01b = 4500
\]

Now, we can solve for \( b \):

\[
b = \frac{4500}{3.01} \approx 1498.34
\]

Now we can find \( r \) and \( g \):

1. Calculate \( r \):

\[
r = 0.99b \approx 0.99 \times 1498.34 \approx 1483.84

Next, we need to find out how much Marissa makes in one hour. According to the problem, Marissa makes \( \frac{3}{4} \) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in the two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we calculate Marissa's hourly production as follows:

Let:
- \( s \) = number of sheep
- \( g \) = number of geese

From the problem, we know:
1. Each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs. The total number of legs is 70.
   \[
   4s + 2g = 70
   \]

2. Each animal has 1 head. The total number of heads is 20.
   \[
   s + g = 20
   \]

Now we have the following system of equations:
1. \( 4s + 2g = 70 \)
2. \( s + g = 20 \)

We can solve this system step by step.

First, we can simplify the first equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[
2s + g = 35
\]

Now we have:
1. \( 2s + g = 35 \)
2. \( s + g = 20 \)

Next, we can subtract the second equation from the first:
\[
(2s + g) - (s + g) = 35 - 20
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
s = 15
\]

Now that we have \( s \), we can substitute it back into the second equation to find \( g \):
\[
15 + g = 20
\]
\[
g = 20 - 15 = 5
\]

Thus, the number of sheep \( s \) is 15, and the number of geese \( g \) is 5.

   - Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 12 toys for 12 dogs.

3. **Toys James Has**:
   - James currently has 4 toys.

4. **Toys James Needs to Buy**:

   - So, James buys 8 more toys.

5. **Situation After Buying Toys**:
   - Now, James has 4 (initial) + 8 (bought) = 12 toys.

6. **Dogs When He Comes Back**:
   - After buying the toys, he sees that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left.
   - Initially, there were 8 new dogs added to the original 4, making it 12.
   - Twice as many more dogs means 8 more dogs (since there were 8 new dogs).
   - Total dogs now = 12 (previous total) + 8 (twice as many more) = 20 dogs.

7. **Toys Needed After Seeing More Dogs**:
   - James needs 20 toys for 20 dogs.

8. **Toys James Has**:
   - He still has 12 toys.

9. **Toys James Needs to Buy Again**:

- Let \( S \) be the number of cookies Summer has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. \( K = M - 5 \) (Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max)
2. \( M = C + 12 \) (Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster)
3. \( S = M + 23 \) (Summer has 23 more cookies than Max)
4. \( K = 68 \) (Katarina has 68 cookies)

Now, we can substitute \( K \) into the first equation:

\[
68 = M - 5

Adding 5 to both sides gives:

\[
M = 68 + 5 = 73
\]

Now that we have \( M \), we can find \( C \) using the second equation:

Substituting \( M = 73 \):

\[
73 = C + 12

Subtracting 12 from both sides gives:

Next, we can find \( S \) using the third equation:

\[
S = M + 23

Substituting \( M = 73 \):

\[
S = 73 + 23 = 96

From the problem, we know the following:

1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet. Let's assume \( T_1 = R_1 + 7 \).
2. The combined ages of the twins and triplets is 44: 
   \[
   T_1 + T_2 + R_1 + R_2 + R_3 = 44
   \]
3. Since \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) are twins, we have \( T_1 = T_2 \).

Let’s denote the age of one twin (and thus the other twin) as \( T \). Therefore, we can rewrite the equations as:

1. \( T = R_1 + 7 \)
2. \( 2T + R_1 + R_2 + R_3 = 44 \)

Now, we can express \( R_2 \) and \( R_3 \) in terms of \( R_1 \). Since the triplets are the same age, we can denote their age as \( R \). Thus, \( R_1 = R_2 = R_3 = R \).

Now we can rewrite the second equation:

\[
2T + R + R + R = 44
\]
\[
2T + 3R = 44
\]

Now we can substitute \( T \) from the first equation into this equation:

From \( T = R + 7 \), we substitute \( T \):

\[

     \]

2. **Calculate Neil's monthly savings:**
   - Neil saves \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more than Rong. 
   - To find out how much more that is, we calculate \( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \):
     \[
     \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \text{ coins}

gsm8k,gsm8k-711,TrustRoute-NoCostAware,1,"To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can buy with $6.00 under the deal of ""buy 2 scoops, get 1 free,"" we can follow these steps:

1. **Cost of Scoops**: Each scoop costs $1.50.
2. **Deal Structure**: For every 2 scoops purchased, Erin gets 1 additional scoop for free.

Let's calculate how many scoops Erin can buy:

- With $6.00, we first find out how many scoops Erin can buy without considering the deal:
  \[
  \text{Number of scoops without deal} = \frac{6.00}{1.50} = 4 \text{ scoops}
  \]

- Now, we apply the deal. For every 2 scoops purchased, Erin gets 1 free scoop. If Erin buys 2 scoops, she will receive 1 additional scoop for free. 

- If Erin buys 4 scoops (which she can afford), she can take advantage of the deal:
  - Buy 2 scoops → Get 1 free → Total = 3 scoops
  - Buy another 2 scoops → Get another 1 free → Total = 3 more scoops

Thus, if Erin buys 4 scoops, she will receive:
\[
\text{Total scoops} = 4 \text{ (bought)} + 2 \text{ (free)} = 6 \text{ scoops}

Topher's shoe length is 8 feet and 4 inches. We can convert this to inches as follows:

1. Convert feet to inches:

   8 \text{ feet} = 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ inches}

1. **Initial Stickers**:
   - Lorraine starts with:
     - Small stickers: 30
     - Large stickers: 40

2. **Trading Small Stickers**:
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = \( 0.9 \times 30 = 27 \) small stickers.
   - Since each large sticker is worth 1 large button or 3 small buttons, 27 small stickers can be traded for:
     - \( \frac{27}{3} = 9 \) large buttons.

3. **Trading Large Stickers**:
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = \( 0.5 \times 40 = 20 \) large stickers.
   - These 20 large stickers can be traded for:
     - 20 large buttons (since 1 large sticker = 1 large button).

4. **Remaining Large Stickers**:
   - After trading 50% of her large stickers, Lorraine has:
     - Remaining large stickers = \( 40 - 20 = 20 \) large stickers.

5. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons**:
   - Lorraine trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Each large button is worth 3 small stickers, so 20 large stickers can be traded for:
     - \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons.

6. **Total Buttons**:
   - Now, let's sum up all the buttons Lorraine has:
     - From small stickers traded: 9 large buttons
     - From large stickers traded: 20 large buttons
     - From remaining large stickers traded: 60 small buttons

   Therefore, the total number of buttons Lorraine has is:

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250:
   \[
   x + y + z = 250
   \]

2. The first house needs half of what the second house needs:

Now, we can substitute \( x \) and \( z \) in terms of \( y \) into the total equation.

From the second equation, we can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):

gsm8k,gsm8k-779,TrustRoute-NoCostAware,1,"To find out how far the Llesis family's vacation spot is, we can break down the problem into two parts: the driving distance and the hiking distance.

1. **Driving Speed**: The family drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.

2. **Hiking Speed**: The hiking speed is given as 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. 
   - Half of their driving speed: \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) miles per hour.
   - Therefore, their hiking speed: \( 25 - 5 = 20 \) miles per hour.

3. **Time Spent Hiking**: It is given that they spent 1.5 hours hiking.

4. **Distance Hiked**: We can calculate the distance they hiked using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   So, the distance hiked is:
   \[
   \text{Distance hiked} = 20 \text{ miles/hour} \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Total Time**: The total time for the trip is 6 hours, and they spent 1.5 hours hiking. Therefore, the time spent driving is:
   \[
   \text{Time driving} = 6 \text{ hours} - 1.5 \text{ hours} = 4.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

6. **Distance Driven**: We can calculate the distance they drove using the same formula:
   \[
   \text{Distance driven} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   So, the distance driven is:
   \[
   \text{Distance driven} = 50 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4.5 \text{ hours} = 225 \text{ miles}
   \]

7. **Total Distance to Vacation Spot**: The total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance driven} + \text{Distance hiked} = 225 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 255 \text{ miles}

gsm8k,gsm8k-780,TrustRoute-NoCostAware,1,"To find the difference between Ava's and Emma's scores, we can set up the scoring based on the information given.

Let:
- \( e \) = number of enemies Emma jumps on
- \( b \) = number of berries Emma collects
- \( t \) = time (in seconds) Emma has left when she finishes the level

From the problem, we know:
- Ava jumps on \( e + 8 \) enemies.
- Ava collects \( b + 3 \) berries.
- Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower, so she has \( t - 4 \) seconds left.

Now we can calculate their scores using the scoring rules:
- Points for enemies: 10 points per enemy
- Points for berries: 5 points per berry
- Points for time: 30 points per second left

**Emma's score:**
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Emma}} = 10e + 5b + 30t
\]

**Ava's score:**
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10(e + 8) + 5(b + 3) + 30(t - 4)
\]

Now, let's simplify Ava's score:
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10e + 80 + 5b + 15 + 30t - 120
\]
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10e + 5b + 30t + 80 + 15 - 120
\]
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10e + 5b + 30t - 25
\]

Now we can find the difference between Ava's and Emma's scores:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} - \text{Score}_{\text{Emma}}
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = (10e + 5b + 30t - 25) - (10e + 5b + 30t)

\[
\text{Difference} = -25

Thus, the difference between Ava's and Emma's scores is \(-25\). This means Ava's score is 25 points lower than Emma's score.",0.00503855,11.811007261276243,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,,1

1. **Calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:**
   - Third graders: 340 out of 500 passed.
   - Fourth graders: 40 out of 100 passed.
   - Fifth graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders.

   First, we calculate the pass rate for the fourth graders:
   \[
   \text{Pass rate for fourth graders} = \frac{40}{100} = 0.4 \text{ or } 40\%
   \]

   Since the fifth graders' pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders:
   \[

     \text{Total chips} = 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips}
     \]

2. **Determine how many square inches of mosaic can be made with the available chips**:
   - It takes 12 chips to cover 1 square inch.
   - Therefore, the number of square inches that can be covered with 144 chips is:

1. **Determine the total number of branches climbed**: Since Felix charges $0.25 per branch and he made $105 in total, we can calculate the total number of branches he climbed by dividing his total earnings by the cost per branch.

   \[
   \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25}

- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt (in ounces).
- Since she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \).
- She uses twice as much oil as salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2s \).
- She uses twice as much salt as zest, so \( s = 2z \).

Now we can express all ingredients in terms of \( z \):

1. Citrus zest: \( z \)
2. Fragrance: \( z \)
3. Salt: \( s = 2z \)
4. Sugar: \( s = 2z \)

\[
s = 3p
\]

Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, which can be expressed as:

\[
b = s + 12 = 3p + 12
\]

We know that the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:

\[
b + s + p = 341
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( b \) and \( s \) in terms of \( p \):

\[
(3p + 12) + (3p) + p = 341

Combining like terms:

\[
3p + 12 + 3p + p = 341

gsm8k,gsm8k-847,TrustRoute-NoCostAware,1,"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years with simple interest, we can use the formula for simple interest:

\[
A = P + I
\]

where:
- \( A \) is the total amount after interest,
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial investment),
- \( I \) is the interest earned.

The interest \( I \) can be calculated using the formula:

\[
I = P \times r \times t
\]

where:
- \( r \) is the rate of interest per year,
- \( t \) is the time in years.

In this case:
- \( P = 300 \) (the initial investment),
- \( r = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75 \) (the interest rate),
- \( t = 3 \) (the number of years).

Now, we can calculate the interest:

I = 300 \times 0.75 \times 3

- Let \( x \) be your age.
- Your brother's age will then be \( x + 3 \) (since you are three years younger than your brother).
- Your sister's age will be \( x - 2 \) (since you are two years older than your sister).
- Your mom's age will be \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \) (since your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age).

Now, we can set up the equation based on the information that the sum of all ages is 87:

   \]
   \[

2. Set the equation equal to 87:

2. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne:
   \[
   S = A + 25

3. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn:
   \[

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) into the total equation.

First, substitute \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[

This simplifies to:
\[

Now we have expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \):

gsm8k,gsm8k-894,TrustRoute-NoCostAware,1,"Let's break down the information given step by step.

1. **Understanding the payments**:
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for mowing his lawn.

2. **Mowing lawns**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
   - According to the problem, Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times as many times as she mowed Joe's lawn, which means she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.
   - The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn 5 times as many times as she did Joe's lawn, which means she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.

3. **Calculating total payments from mowing**:
   - The total payment from Joe is \( 6 \) dollars.
   - The payment from Kamala can be calculated as \( 6 \) dollars per mowing session (assuming the same rate as Joe), so for \( 3x \) mowings, it would be \( 6 \times 3x = 18x \) dollars.
   - The payment from Alba would be \( 6 \times 5x = 30x \) dollars.

4. **Total earnings from mowing**:
   - The total earnings from mowing lawns is:
     \[
     6 + 18x + 30x = 6 + 48x
     \]

5. **Total earnings from lemonade sales**:
   - Tasha made a total of $80 from both lemonade and mowing lawns. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     6 + 48x + L = 80
     \]
   where \( L \) is the amount she made from lemonade sales.

6. **Solving for \( L \)**:
   - Rearranging the equation gives:
     \[
     L = 80 - (6 + 48x)
     \]
     \[
     L = 80 - 6 - 48x
     \]
     \[
     L = 74 - 48x
     \]

7. **Finding \( x \)**:
   - Since \( x \) represents the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn, it must be a non-negative integer. The maximum value of \( L \) occurs when \( x = 0 \):
     \[
     L = 74 - 48(0) = 74
     \]
   - As \( x \) increases, \( L \) decreases. We need to find a reasonable value for \( x \) that keeps \( L \) non-negative.

8. **Finding maximum \( x \)**:
   - To ensure \( L \geq 0 \):
     \[
     74 - 48x \geq 0
     \]
     \[
     74 \geq 48x
     \]
     \[
     x \leq \frac{74}{48} \approx 1.54
     \]
   - Thus, \( x \) can be 0, 1, or 1 (since it must be an integer).

9. **Calculating \( L \) for possible \( x \)**:
   - If \( x = 1 \):
     \[
     L = 74 - 48(1) = 74 - 48 = 26
     \]
   - If \( x = 0 \):
     \[
     L = 74 - 48(0) = 74
     \]

10. **Conclusion**:
   - The amount Tasha made from lemonade sales can be either $26 (if she mowed Joe's lawn once) or $74 (if she didn't mow Joe's lawn at all). 

Thus, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is **$26** if she mowed Joe's lawn once.",0.00711455,18.888729095458984,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_confidence,,1

gsm8k,gsm8k-931,TrustRoute-NoCostAware,1,"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( A \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + A + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   A = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = A + J
   \]

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first and third equations.

Substituting \( A = J + 10 \) into the first equation:
\[
P + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
P + 2J + 10 = 100
\]
Subtracting 10 from both sides gives:
\[
P + 2J = 90 \quad \text{(1)}
\]

Now, substituting \( A = J + 10 \) into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
P = 2J + 10 \quad \text{(2)}
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \( P + 2J = 90 \) (from equation 1)
2. \( P = 2J + 10 \) (from equation 2)

We can substitute equation (2) into equation (1):
\[
(2J + 10) + 2J = 90
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
4J + 10 = 90
\]
Subtracting 10 from both sides gives:
\[
4J = 80
\]
Dividing by 4 gives:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now that we have Jean's age, we can find Paul's age:
\[
A = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]

Finally, we can find Peter's age using equation (2):
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50

Thus, the ages are:

- Paul: 30 years

gsm8k,gsm8k-945,TrustRoute-NoCostAware,1,"To determine how long it took James to swim across the lake, we can break down the problem into several steps.

1. **Calculate the distance he swims initially:**
   James swims 60% of the total distance of 20 miles.
   \[
   \text{Distance swum} = 0.6 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to swim the first part:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time for first part} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}

   He rests for half the time it took him to swim the first part.
   \[
   \text{Resting time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   The remaining distance after swimming 12 miles is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the speed for the remaining distance:**
   He swims the remaining distance at half his original speed:

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. The total points scored by all three is 45:
   \[
   B + A + D = 45
   \]

2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo:
   \[
   B = A + 20
   \]

3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar:
   \[
   B = D + 10
   \]

Now, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):

From the second equation:
\[
A = B - 20
\]

From the third equation:
\[
D = B - 10
\]

Now, we can substitute \( A \) and \( D \) into the total points equation:

\[
B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45
\]

Simplifying this, we get:
\[
B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45
\]
\[
3B - 30 = 45
\]

Now, add 30 to both sides:
\[
3B = 75
\]

Dividing by 3:
\[
B = 25
\]

Now that we have \( B \), we can find \( A \) and \( D \):

Using \( A = B - 20 \):
\[
A = 25 - 20 = 5
\]

Using \( D = B - 10 \):
\[
D = 25 - 10 = 15

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of each day:**
   - **Day 1:** The pirates dug 10 holes.
   - **Day 2:** They dug 13 more holes, so the total by the end of Day 2 is:
     \[
     10 + 13 = 23 \text{ holes}
     \]
   - **Day 3:** They dug 8 more holes but filled in 2 holes, so the net holes dug on Day 3 is:
     \[
     8 - 2 = 6 \text{ holes}
     \]
     Thus, the total by the end of Day 3 is:
     \[
     23 + 6 = 29 \text{ holes}

2. **Determine the number of holes at the end of Day 1:**
   - At the end of Day 1, the number of holes is 10.

3. **Calculate the number of holes by the end of Day 4:**
   - According to the problem, by the end of Day 4, the number of holes is four times the number of holes at the end of Day 1:
   \[
   4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ holes}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of holes dug on the fourth day:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of holes dug on the fourth day. The total number of holes at the end of Day 4 can be expressed as:
   \[
   29 + x = 40
   \]
   To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
   \[
   x = 40 - 29 = 11

gsm8k,gsm8k-991,TrustRoute-NoCostAware,1,"Let's denote the age of Bill's dad when he first saw Comet Halley as \( D \) and the age of Bill when he first saw the comet as \( B \).

1. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old, so \( D = 30 \).
2. The comet orbits the sun every 75 years, so after 75 years, Bill's dad will see the comet again at age \( D + 75 = 30 + 75 = 105 \).
3. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. 

Since Bill's dad was 30 years old when he first saw the comet, we need to find out how old Bill's dad was when Bill saw the comet for the second time. 

Let \( x \) be the number of years after the first sighting of the comet that Bill saw it again. Therefore, Bill's dad's age when Bill saw the comet for the second time is \( 30 + x \).

According to the problem, Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. This means:

\[
B + x = 3(30 + x)
\]

Now we can solve for \( x \):

\[
B + x = 90 + 3x
\]
\[
B = 90 + 3x - x
\]
\[
B = 90 + 2x
\]

Now we also know that \( x = 75 \) because the comet reappears every 75 years. Substituting \( x = 75 \) into the equation gives:

\[
B = 90 + 2(75)
\]
\[
B = 90 + 150
\]
\[
B = 240
\]

This means Bill would be 240 years old, which is not possible. Let's re-evaluate the situation.

Since Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30, and it reappears every 75 years, we can determine that Bill's dad will see it again at age 105. 

Now, if we assume that Bill saw the comet for the first time when he was \( B \), then:

1. Bill's dad saw the comet at age 30.
2. The second sighting occurs 75 years later, when Bill's dad is 105.
3. At that time, Bill is \( B + 75 \).

We need to set up the equation again:

\[
B + 75 = 3 \times 30
\]
\[
B + 75 = 90
\]
\[
B = 90 - 75
\]
\[
B = 15

According to the problem, the first plane flies to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. Therefore, the number of flights to Greece is:

\[
\frac{3}{4}x
\]

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. The remaining flights can be calculated as:

\[
x - \frac{3}{4}x = \frac{1}{4}x
\]

Since these remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{4}x \right) = \frac{1}{8}x
\]

Now, we also know that the second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
44 = \frac{1}{2}x
\]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides by 2:

\[
x = 88

Now that we have the total number of flights for the first plane, we can find the number of flights to France:

\[

- Alessandro's age: \( Al = 4 \) years
- Helene's age: \( H \)
- Wilfred's age: \( W \)

According to the problem, the total age of the children is 20 years. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
A + Al + H + W = 20
\]

Substituting the known ages of Akbar and Alessandro:

\[
3 + 4 + H + W = 20
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
H + W = 20 - 7 = 13 \quad \text{(1)}

Thus, Helene's age can be expressed as:

\[
H = 2 \times \text{Average age} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \quad \text{(2)}

Each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as a kid's slice, so each adult gets:

1. **Identify the number of red sticks**: 
   - There are 9 red sticks.

2. **Calculate the number of blue sticks**: 
   - The problem states that there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks. 
   - Therefore, the number of blue sticks is:
     \[
     \text{Number of blue sticks} = \text{Number of red sticks} + 5 = 9 + 5 = 14

3. **Calculate the number of yellow sticks**: 
   - The problem states that the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks.
   - Therefore, the number of yellow sticks is:
     \[
     \text{Number of yellow sticks} = \text{Number of blue sticks} - 3 = 14 - 3 = 11

       - **Convinces Teacher (20% chance)**: If Marcus convinces the teacher, he does not have to turn in his homework.
       - **Does Not Convince Teacher (80% chance)**: If Marcus cannot convince the teacher, he has to turn in his homework.

Now, let's calculate the probabilities step by step:

- Probability of having to turn in homework if the normal teacher is present:
  - Probability of no extension and not convincing the teacher:
    - Probability of no extension = 60%
    - Probability of not convincing the teacher = 80%
    - Combined probability = 0.60 * 0.80 = 0.48 (or 48%)

Now, we combine the probabilities from both scenarios:

- Probability of having to turn in homework with a substitute teacher = 0% (50% chance)
- Probability of having to turn in homework with a normal teacher = 50% * 48% = 0.50 * 0.48 = 0.24 (or 24%)

Finally, we add the probabilities of both scenarios where Marcus has to turn in his homework:

- Total probability of having to turn in homework = 0.24 (from normal teacher) + 0 (from substitute teacher) = 0.24

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

- Total percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework = 24%.

Thus, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is **24%**.",0.00516335,11.954302072525024,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,,1

According to the problem:

- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls (four more than in the second set).
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls (half as many as in the second set).

The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is given as 19. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Now, let's simplify this equation step by step:

1. Combine like terms:
   \[
   2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
   \]

2. To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 2:
   \[

Since the total amount of fence they have is 100 feet, we can set up the following equation:

\[
S + H = 100
\]

Substituting \( H \) with \( S + 60 \):

gsm8k,gsm8k-1168,TrustRoute-NoCostAware,1,"Let's denote the lengths of the ropes as follows:

- Let \( r \) be the length of the red rope.
- Let \( b \) be the length of the blue rope.
- Let \( y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope:
   \[
   r = 4b
   \]

2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope:
   \[
   b = y - 7
   \]

3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters:
   \[
   r + b + y = 37
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( r \) and \( b \) into the combined length equation.

Substituting \( r \) from the first equation:
\[
4b + b + y = 37
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
5b + y = 37
\]

Now, substitute \( b \) from the second equation:
\[
5b + (b + 7) = 37
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
5b + b + 7 = 37
\]
\[
6b + 7 = 37
\]

Now, subtract 7 from both sides:
\[
6b = 30
\]

Now, divide by 6:
\[
b = 5
\]

Now that we have the length of the blue rope, we can find the lengths of the other ropes. First, we find the yellow rope:
\[
y = b + 7 = 5 + 7 = 12

2. **Amount Given to Their Sister**:
   - Let \( x \) be the amount of money that both Ronnie and Rissa gave to their little sister.

3. **Rissa's Remaining Money**:
   - After giving \( x \) dollars to her sister, Rissa has \( 15 - x \) dollars left.
   - According to the problem, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original amount, which is \( \frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12 \) dollars.

- Purple paint: \( r \) pints
- Yellow paint: \( y \) pints

According to the problem, half of the mural is yellow. Therefore, we can express the amount of yellow paint as:

\[

   - Removes 1 liter per day.
   - For 3 days: 
     \[
     1 \text{ liter/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3 \text{ liters}
     \]

2. **Medium Setting**: 
   - Removes twice as much as the low setting, which is \(2 \times 1 = 2\) liters per day.
   - For 3 days: 
     \[
     2 \text{ liters/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ liters}
     \]

3. **High Setting**: 
   - Removes twice as much as the medium setting, which is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) liters per day.
   - For 5 days: 
     \[
     4 \text{ liters/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ liters}

1. **Total Distance**: Phineas is 200 yards away from home.

2. **Distance on Land**: Half of the distance is on land, so:
   \[
   \text{Distance on land} = \frac{200 \text{ yards}}{2} = 100 \text{ yards}
   \]

3. **Distance in Water**: The other half is in water, so:

1. **Understanding the speeds**:
   - Let \( v \) be Vanessa's speed in miles per minute.
   - Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Aaron's speed is \( 2v \).

2. **Distance run by Vanessa**:
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles.

3. **Distance run by Aaron**:
   - Since Vanessa can run twice as far as Aaron, we can denote the distance Aaron ran as \( d \). Thus, we have:
     \[
     4 = 2d \implies d = 2 \text{ miles}
     \]

4. **Time taken by Aaron**:
   - We know Aaron completed his part of the race (2 miles) in 16 minutes. We can calculate Aaron's speed:
     \[
     \text{Speed of Aaron} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{8} \text{ miles per minute}

We have two pieces of information:

1. The total number of animals is 20:
   \[
   C + W = 20
   \]

2. The total number of legs is 70. Chickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each:
   \[
   2C + 4W = 70
   \]

Now we can solve these equations step by step.

From the first equation, we can express \( W \) in terms of \( C \):
\[
W = 20 - C
\]

Next, we substitute \( W \) into the second equation:
\[
2C + 4(20 - C) = 70
\]

Expanding this gives:
\[
2C + 80 - 4C = 70
\]

Combining like terms:
\[
-2C + 80 = 70
\]

Subtracting 80 from both sides:
\[
-2C = 70 - 80
\]
\[
-2C = -10
\]

Dividing both sides by -2:
\[
