1. **Calculate the total investment**: This includes the purchase price of the house and the cost of repairs.
   \[
   \text{Total Investment} = \text{Purchase Price} + \text{Repair Costs}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Investment} = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the increased value of the house**: The value of the house increased by 150%. To find the new value, we first need to calculate 150% of the original purchase price.
   \[
   \text{Increase in Value} = \text{Purchase Price} \times 1.5
   \]
   \[
   \text{Increase in Value} = 80,000 \times 1.5 = 120,000
   \]

   Now, we add this increase to the original purchase price to find the new value of the house.
   \[
   \text{New Value} = \text{Purchase Price} + \text{Increase in Value}
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Value} = 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000

   \text{Profit} = \text{New Value} - \text{Total Investment}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000

- 75% of \( P \) equals $19.50.
- In mathematical terms: \( 0.75 \times P = 19.50 \).

### Step 3: Solve for \( P \)
- Divide both sides by 0.75:  
  \( P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \).
- Performing the division:  
  \( 19.50 \div 0.75 = 26 \).

### Step 4: Verify the solution
- If the original price is $26, a 25% discount would be \( 0.25 \times 26 = 6.50 \).
- Subtract the discount from the original price: \( 26 - 6.50 = 19.50 \), which matches the price Kyle paid.

Therefore, the original price of the book was **$26.00**.",0.0028049000000000004,12.607826232910156,0,0,cand-grok-3-mini,stage2_vote,
gsm8k,gsm8k-25,TrustRoute,1,"Let me help you solve this step by step. We're trying to determine how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered based on the total cost.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the known items
- Chicken meal: 1 × $12 = $12
- Packs of milk: 5 × $3 = $15
- Apples: 4 × $1.50 = $6

Total cost of these items: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33

### Step 2: Determine the cost of the pizzas
Marie paid a total of $50, so the amount spent on pizzas is:
$50 - $33 = $17

### Step 3: Calculate the number of pizzas
Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find the number of boxes:
Number of boxes = $17 ÷ $8.50 = 2

### Step 4: Verify the total
- Chicken: $12
- Milk: $15
- Apples: $6
- Pizzas: 2 × $8.50 = $17
- Total: $12 + $15 + $6 + $17 = $50

This matches the total amount paid, so the calculation is correct.

1. Henry's total trip distance is 60 miles.
2. He made his first stop after 20 miles.
3. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip.

First, we need to determine where the second stop occurred. Since the trip is 60 miles long and the second stop is 15 miles from the end, we can calculate the distance to the second stop:

\[
\text{Distance to second stop} = \text{Total distance} - \text{Distance before end} = 60 \text{ miles} - 15 \text{ miles} = 45 \text{ miles}

Now, we know:
- First stop: 20 miles
- Second stop: 45 miles

To find the distance traveled between the first and second stops, we subtract the distance of the first stop from the distance of the second stop:

\[
\text{Distance between stops} = \text{Distance to second stop} - \text{Distance to first stop} = 45 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} = 25 \text{ miles}

**Given information:**
- Bridge weight limit: 5000 pounds
- Weight of each box: 15 pounds
- Weight of driver + empty truck: 3755 pounds

**Step-by-step solution:**

1) First, I'll find how much weight capacity is available for boxes:
   - Available capacity = Bridge limit - (Driver + Empty truck)

Let L be the number of games the team lost.

We are given two pieces of information:
1.  The team played a total of 22 games. This means the sum of games won and lost is 22.
    W + L = 22

2.  The team won 8 more games than they lost.
    W = L + 8

Now we have a system of two linear equations:
1) W + L = 22
2) W = L + 8

We can solve this system using substitution. Substitute the expression for W from equation (2) into equation (1):
(L + 8) + L = 22

Combine like terms:
2L + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:
2L = 22 - 8
2L = 14

Divide by 2:
L = 14 / 2
L = 7

So, the team lost 7 games.

Now, substitute the value of L back into equation (2) to find W:
W = L + 8
W = 7 + 8
W = 15

The team won 15 games.

To verify:
Won = 15
Lost = 7
Total games = 15 + 7 = 22 (Correct)
Won is 8 more than lost: 15 = 7 + 8 (Correct)

The team won 15 games.

gsm8k,gsm8k-87,TrustRoute,1,"To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, let's break this down step by step based on the information provided.

### Step 1: Understand the initial salary
- Sylvie's base monthly salary is $600.
- Therefore, her initial annual salary is:  
  \( 600 \times 12 = 7,200 \) dollars.

### Step 2: Understand the salary increase policy
- The company increases salaries by 10% of the initial salary every year for employees who have stayed 5 years.
- The initial salary is the original annual salary, which is $7,200.
- 10% of the initial salary is:  
  \( 0.10 \times 7,200 = 720 \) dollars.
- This means that starting from the year after Sylvie reaches 5 years (which she just did), her salary increases by a fixed amount of $720 each year.

### Step 3: Calculate the salary year by year
- At the end of her 5th year (now), her annual salary is still $7,200.
- For each subsequent year, we add $720 to her current annual salary.

  - End of year 6 (after 1 more year):  
    \( 7,200 + 720 = 7,920 \) dollars.

  - End of year 7 (after 2 more years):  
    \( 7,920 + 720 = 8,640 \) dollars.

  - End of year 8 (after 3 more years):  
    \( 8,640 + 720 = 9,360 \) dollars.

### Step 1: Identify the rings for each friend
- **First friend**: Pressed the doorbell 20 times.
- **Second friend**: Pressed 1/4 times more than the first friend. This means we add 1/4 of the first friend's rings to the first friend's rings.
  - 1/4 of 20 = 5
  - So, second friend = 20 + 5 = 25 rings.
- **Fourth friend**: Pressed the doorbell 60 times.

\[
\text{Total hours} = 1 + 1 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2
\]

Combining the constant hours:

\[
\text{Total hours} = 5.5 + 0.5x
\]

According to the problem, the total hours watched is 7 hours:

\[
5.5 + 0.5x = 7
\]

Now, we can solve for \( x \):

1. Subtract 5.5 from both sides:

\[
0.5x = 7 - 5.5
\]
\[
0.5x = 1.5
\]

2. Divide both sides by 0.5:

\[
x = \frac{1.5}{0.5} = 3
\]

gsm8k,gsm8k-108,TrustRoute,1,"Let me reason through this step by step to determine how many cookies Henry baked last year.

Let \( x \) represent the number of cookies Henry baked last year.

- Henry intended to bake twice as many as last year, so he planned to bake \( 2x \) cookies.
- However, he actually baked 15 more than intended, so he baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.
- After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, leaving him with \( (2x + 15) - 5 \) cookies.
- We know he ended up with 110 cookies, so we can set up the equation:
  \[
  (2x + 15) - 5 = 110
  \]
- Simplify the equation:
  \[
  2x + 10 = 110
  \]
- Subtract 10 from both sides:
  \[
  2x = 100
  \]
- Divide both sides by 2:
  \[
  x = 50
  \]

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year. To verify:
- He intended to bake \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) cookies.
- He actually baked \( 100 + 15 = 115 \) cookies.
- After dropping 5, he had \( 115 - 5 = 110 \) cookies, which matches the problem.",0.00390325,13.84676718711853,0,0,cand-grok-3-mini,stage2_confidence,

**Beatrice's roll-ups:**
- Width: 2 roll-ups
- Length: 24 roll-ups

The total number of roll-ups Beatrice had is calculated as:
\[
\text{Total for Beatrice} = \text{Width} \times \text{Length} = 2 \times 24 = 48
\]

**Marcell's roll-ups:**
- Width: 3 roll-ups
- Length: 14 roll-ups

The total number of roll-ups Marcell had is calculated as:
\[
\text{Total for Marcell} = \text{Width} \times \text{Length} = 3 \times 14 = 42
\]

Now, we can find the total number of roll-ups eaten by both:
\[
\text{Total roll-ups} = \text{Total for Beatrice} + \text{Total for Marcell} = 48 + 42 = 90
\]

Next, we calculate the average number of roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice:
\[

Let me break this down step by step:

**Step 1: Find the total distance to shore**
- It took Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet
- The shore was 64 seconds away
- So the total distance = (64 seconds ÷ 16 seconds) × 20 feet = 4 × 20 feet = 80 feet

**Step 2: Calculate water intake rate**

- Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's (4 years ago)
- Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%
- Both salaries increased simultaneously (by the same percentage)

**Step 1: Find Lylah's salary 4 years ago**

If Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's:
- Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary × 1.30
- $40,000 = Lylah's salary × 1.30
- Lylah's salary = $40,000 ÷ 1.30
- Lylah's salary = $30,769.23 (approximately)

**Step 2: Find Adrien's salary four years later**

Adrien's salary increased by 40%:
- New salary = $40,000 × 1.40
- New salary = $56,000

**Step 3: Find Lylah's salary four years later**

Since both salaries increased simultaneously (by the same 40%):
- Lylah's new salary = $30,769.23 × 1.40
- Lylah's new salary = $43,076.92 (approximately)

**Step 4: Calculate total salary four years later**

Total = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary

Let me define variables:

1. Total bees: q + b + w = 700
2. ""Twice as many worker bees as baby bees"": w = 2b
3. ""Twice as many babies as queens"": b = 2q

From equation 3: b = 2q

Substituting into equation 1:

q + 2q + 4q = 700

   - Total length of baguettes = 60 baguettes × 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches.

4. **Sum the total lengths:**

gsm8k,gsm8k-157,TrustRoute,1,"To determine how much farther the winner runs than the loser, we first need to calculate the distances that both Blake and Kelly run.

**Blake's Distance:**
Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard football field. Each back-and-forth run consists of running 100 yards to one end and then 100 yards back, which totals 200 yards for one complete back-and-forth run.

So, for 15 back-and-forth runs:
\[
\text{Distance Blake runs} = 15 \times 200 \text{ yards} = 3000 \text{ yards}
\]

**Kelly's Distance:**
Kelly runs back and forth once on the 100-yard field, which is:
\[
\text{Distance for one back-and-forth run} = 200 \text{ yards}
\]

After that, she runs to the 40-yard line and back. The distance to the 40-yard line is 40 yards, and the distance back is also 40 yards, making it:
\[
\text{Distance to the 40-yard line and back} = 40 + 40 = 80 \text{ yards}
\]

Kelly repeats this run to the 40-yard line and back 34 times:
\[
\text{Total distance for 34 runs} = 34 \times 80 \text{ yards} = 2720 \text{ yards}
\]

Now, we add the distance of her initial back-and-forth run to the total distance of her runs to the 40-yard line:
\[
\text{Total distance Kelly runs} = 200 \text{ yards} + 2720 \text{ yards} = 2920 \text{ yards}
\]

**Comparing Distances:**
Now we compare the distances run by Blake and Kelly:
- Blake: 3000 yards
- Kelly: 2920 yards

To find out how much farther the winner (Blake) runs than the loser (Kelly):
\[
\text{Difference} = 3000 \text{ yards} - 2920 \text{ yards} = 80 \text{ yards}

**Team A (Well-rounded team):**
- Each member runs their leg in 55 seconds.
- Total time for Team A = 4 members × 55 seconds/member = 220 seconds.

**Team B (Less well-rounded team):**
- The first runner runs their leg in 60 seconds.
- The second runner runs 3 seconds faster than the first, so they run it in 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
- The third runner runs 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run it in 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
- The fourth runner runs 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run it in 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Now, we calculate the total time for Team B:

gsm8k,gsm8k-186,TrustRoute,1,"To solve the problem, let's break down the distribution of straw among the rodents step by step.

1. **Rats**: 
   - Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage.
   - There are 3 cages of rats, so the total number of rats is \( 3r \).
   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, so the total straw given to rats is:
     \[
     \text{Straw for rats} = 3r \times 6 = 18r
     \]

2. **Hamsters**:
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - Let \( h \) be the number of hamsters in each cage.
   - The total number of hamsters is \( 10h \).
   - The total straw given to hamsters is:
     \[
     \text{Straw for hamsters} = 10h \times 5 = 50h
     \]

3. **Rabbits**:
   - The problem states that 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

4. **Total Straw Distributed**:
   - The total amount of straw distributed among all rodents is given as 160 pieces. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     18r + 50h + 20 = 160
     \]

5. **Simplifying the Equation**:
   - Subtract 20 from both sides:
     \[
     18r + 50h = 140
     \]

6. **Finding Possible Values**:
   - We need to find integer values for \( r \) and \( h \) that satisfy this equation. We can express \( h \) in terms of \( r \):
     \[
     50h = 140 - 18r
     \]
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18r}{50}
     \]

   - For \( h \) to be an integer, \( 140 - 18r \) must be divisible by 50. We can test integer values for \( r \):

   - **Testing Values**:
     - If \( r = 0 \):
       \[
       h = \frac{140 - 0}{50} = 2.8 \quad (\text{not an integer})
       \]
     - If \( r = 1 \):
       \[
       h = \frac{140 - 18}{50} = \frac{122}{50} = 2.44 \quad (\text{not an integer})
       \]
     - If \( r = 2 \):
       \[
       h = \frac{140 - 36}{50} = \frac{104}{50} = 2.08 \quad (\text{not an integer})
       \]
     - If \( r = 3 \):
       \[
       h = \frac{140 - 54}{50} = \frac{86}{50} = 1.72 \quad (\text{not an integer})
       \]
     - If \( r = 4 \):
       \[
       h = \frac{140 - 72}{50} = \frac{68}{50} = 1.36 \quad (\text{not an integer})
       \]
     - If \( r = 5 \):
       \[
       h = \frac{140 - 90}{50} = \frac{50}{50} = 1 \quad (\text{integer})
       \]
     - If \( r = 6 \):
       \[
       h = \frac{140 - 108}{50} = \frac{32}{50} = 0.64 \quad (\text{not an integer})
       \]
     - If \( r = 7 \):

       h = \frac{140 - 126}{50} = \frac{14}{50} = 0.28 \quad (\text{not an integer})

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The only integer solution found is \( r = 5 \) and \( h = 1 \).
   - Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is:

gsm8k,gsm8k-198,TrustRoute,1,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of Pokemon cards**: Elaine starts with 20 cards.

2. **Cards collected in the first month**: 
   - She collected three times her initial number of cards.
   - Cards collected in the first month = \(3 \times 20 = 60\).

3. **Cards collected in the second month**: 
   - She collected 20 fewer cards than she did in the first month.
   - Cards collected in the second month = \(60 - 20 = 40\).

4. **Cards collected in the third month**: 
   - She collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months.
   - Total cards from the first and second months = \(60 + 40 = 100\).
   - Cards collected in the third month = \(2 \times 100 = 200\).

5. **Total number of Pokemon cards now**: 
   - Total cards = Initial cards + Cards from the first month + Cards from the second month + Cards from the third month.
   - Total cards = \(20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320\).

Thus, Elaine now has a total of **320 Pokemon cards**.",0.00330585,14.837923049926758,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,
gsm8k,gsm8k-199,TrustRoute,1,"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the payment from Publisher A:**
   - Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers.
   - He edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, so he edits \( \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \) sentences for Publisher A.
   - Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence.
   - Therefore, the total payment from Publisher A is:
     \[
     500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents}
     \]

2. **Determine the payment from Publisher B:**
   - Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, which means Publisher B pays:
     \[
     2 \times 5 \text{ cents} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence}
     \]
   - Since he also edits 500 sentences for Publisher B, the total payment from Publisher B is:
     \[
     500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total earnings for the week:**
   - To find Mark's total earnings, we add the payments from both publishers:
     \[
     2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents}
     \]

Thus, Mark makes a total of **7500 cents** in a week.",0.00218445,15.330427885055542,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,
