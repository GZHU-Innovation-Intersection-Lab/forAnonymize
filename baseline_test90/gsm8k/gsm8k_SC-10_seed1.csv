1. **Calculate the total salary for the year before the raise:**
   - John makes $2000 a week.
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - Total salary before the raise = $2000/week * 52 weeks = $104,000.

2. **Calculate the raise:**
   - John receives a 5% raise on his weekly salary.
   - Raise amount = 5% of $2000 = 0.05 * $2000 = $100.
   - New weekly salary after the raise = $2000 + $100 = $2100.

3. **Calculate the total salary for the year after the raise:**
   - Since he received the raise on the first day of the year, he will earn the new salary for the entire year.

gsm8k,gsm8k-205,SC-10,1,"To find out what score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after dropping the lowest score, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total score needed for an average of 93 after dropping the lowest score.**
   Since there are six tests, and we will drop the lowest score, we will be averaging the highest five scores. To find the total score needed for an average of 93, we can use the formula:

   \[
   \text{Total needed} = \text{Average} \times \text{Number of tests considered}
   \]

   Here, the average is 93 and the number of tests considered is 5 (after dropping the lowest score):

   \[
   \text{Total needed} = 93 \times 5 = 465
   \]

2. **Calculate the sum of the first five test scores.**
   Brinley's scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. We need to calculate their sum:

   \[
   \text{Sum of scores} = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438
   \]

3. **Determine the score needed on the sixth test.**
   Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test. The total score after including the sixth test will be \( 438 + x \). We need to ensure that after dropping the lowest score, the total of the highest five scores equals 465.

   To find \( x \), we need to consider the lowest score among the five tests. The lowest score is 71. If we drop 71, we need the total of the remaining scores (which includes the sixth test) to be 465:

   \[
   438 + x - 71 = 465
   \]

   Simplifying this equation:

   \[
   438 + x - 71 = 465
   \]
   \[
   367 + x = 465
   \]
   \[
   x = 465 - 367

1. **Weight of the chocolate bars:**
   - Joe has 25 chocolate bars.
   - Each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams.
   - Total weight of chocolate bars = Number of chocolate bars × Weight of each chocolate bar
   \[
   \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ grams}
   \]

2. **Weight of the candied apples:**
   - Joe has 80 candied apples.
   - Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, we can find the weight of each candied apple.
   - Let the weight of each candied apple be \( x \) grams. Then:
   \[
   40 = 2x \implies x = \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ grams}

Next, we need to calculate how much money Sara has after babysitting and how much more she needs to earn by mowing the lawn.

1. **Earnings from babysitting**: 
   - She babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time.
   - Total earnings from babysitting = 4 × $5 = $20

2. **Total money Sara has after babysitting**:
   - She had $10 saved before babysitting.
   - Total money = $10 + $20 = $30

Now, we find out how much more money she needs to afford the jacket and shoes:

\[

gsm8k,gsm8k-211,SC-10,1,"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, so the total egg production from red chickens is \( 3r \).
2. The white chickens produce 5 eggs a day, so the total egg production from white chickens is \( 5w \).
3. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs every day, which gives us the equation:
   \[
   3r + 5w = 42
   \]
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which gives us the equation:
   \[
   w = r + 2
   \]

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation. Replacing \( w \) in the first equation gives us:
\[
3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
\]

Expanding this equation:
\[
3r + 5r + 10 = 42
\]

Combining like terms:
\[
8r + 10 = 42
\]

Now, subtract 10 from both sides:
\[
8r = 32

Dividing both sides by 8:
\[
r = 4

Now that we have \( r \), we can find \( w \):
\[
w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6

- **6 white chickens**

To verify, we can check the total egg production:
- From red chickens: \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) eggs
- From white chickens: \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \) eggs
- Total: \( 12 + 30 = 42 \) eggs

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of red chickens Jerry has is \( \boxed{4} \).",0.0027254999999999,74.2506775856018,0.0,0.0,gpt-4o-mini,,,1

   Y = \frac{N}{2} + 10 = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]

2. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi:
   \[
   B = N + 17 = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]

Now we have the scores for Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
- Naomi: \( 68 \)
- Yuri: \( 44 \)
- Brianna: \( 85 \)

Next, we can find Jojo's score using the total points scored by all students:
\[
N + Y + B + J = 251
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
68 + 44 + 85 + J = 251
\]

Calculating the sum of Naomi's, Yuri's, and Brianna's scores:
\[
68 + 44 = 112
\]
\[
112 + 85 = 197
\]

Now, substituting this back into the equation:
\[
197 + J = 251
\]

To find Jojo's score, we subtract 197 from 251:
\[
J = 251 - 197 = 54
\]

Thus, Jojo scored \( \boxed{54} \) points.",0.0022232999999999,64.71869993209839,0.0,0.0,gpt-4o-mini,,,1

gsm8k,gsm8k-242,SC-10,1,"To determine how many hours Mike spends writing letters each week, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of pen pals Mike has now:**
   - Initially, Mike had 5 pen pals.
   - He stopped being pen pals with 2 of them.
   - Therefore, the number of pen pals he has now is:
     \[
     5 - 2 = 3
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of letters sent each week:**
   - Each pen pal sends 2 letters a week.
   - With 3 pen pals, the total number of letters sent to him each week is:
     \[
     3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ letters}
     \]

3. **Determine the total number of pages he receives each week:**
   - Each letter is 5 pages long.
   - Therefore, the total number of pages he receives each week is:
     \[
     6 \text{ letters} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 30 \text{ pages}
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of pages Mike writes in response:**
   - Mike responds in kind, so he writes the same number of pages he receives.
   - Thus, he writes 30 pages each week.

5. **Determine how long it takes Mike to write one page:**
   - Mike can write a page in 6 minutes.

6. **Calculate the total time spent writing pages in minutes:**
   - The total time in minutes for writing 30 pages is:
     \[
     30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes}
     \]

7. **Convert the total time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
     \[
     \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, Mike spends **3 hours** writing each week.",0.0024428999999999,69.69114398956299,0.0,0.0,gpt-4o-mini,,,1

\]

Now that we have Jamal's apples, we can find the number of bananas Jamal has using the third equation:
\[
J_b = J_a + 4 = 44 + 4 = 48

Next, we can find the number of bananas Andrea has using the second equation:
\[
A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation. 

Substituting \( R \) in the second equation:

   - Therefore, the total number of books sold over the three years is:
     \[
     250 - 50 = 200 \text{ books}
     \]

4. **Second Year Sales**: 
   - Let \( x \) be the number of books sold in the second year.
   - The total number of books sold over the three years can be expressed as:
     \[
     90 \text{ (first year)} + x \text{ (second year)} + 45 \text{ (current year)} = 200
     \]
   - Simplifying this gives:
     \[
     90 + x + 45 = 200
     \]
     \[
     x + 135 = 200
     \]
     \[
     x = 200 - 135 = 65
     \]
   - So, Elise sold 65 books in the second year.

5. **Earnings in the Second Year**: 
   - Each book sells for $20.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is:
     \[
     65 \text{ books} \times 20 \text{ dollars/book} = 1300 \text{ dollars}
     \]

   - We know that Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old six years ago.
   - Therefore, Noah's current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

2. **Calculate the population of Chile six years ago**:
   - We are told that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.

gsm8k,gsm8k-314,SC-10,1,"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( d \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is \( 2d \) (twice as many as on defense).
- The number of players on special teams is \( \frac{d}{2} \) (half the number of players on defense).

Now, we can set up an equation based on the total number of members in the team:

\[
d + 2d + \frac{d}{2} = 105
\]

Combining the terms on the left side:

\[
3d + \frac{d}{2} = 105
\]

To combine \( 3d \) and \( \frac{d}{2} \), we can convert \( 3d \) into a fraction with a denominator of 2:

\[
3d = \frac{6d}{2}
\]

Now we can rewrite the equation:

\[
\frac{6d}{2} + \frac{d}{2} = 105
\]

Combining the fractions:

\[
\frac{6d + d}{2} = 105
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{7d}{2} = 105
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 2:

\[
7d = 210
\]

Now, divide both sides by 7:

\[
d = 30
\]

Thus, the number of players on the defense is \( \boxed{30} \). 

To verify:
- Offense: \( 2d = 2 \times 30 = 60 \)
- Special teams: \( \frac{d}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \)

Now, adding these together:

\[

   Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, the total weakening from the 5 ice cubes is:

   \[
   \text{Weakening from ice cubes} = \text{Number of ice cubes} \times \text{Weakening per ice cube} = 5 \times 12 \text{ milliliters} = 60 \text{ milliliters}
   \]

3. **Weakening Effect of Cream**:
   Adding 15 milliliters of cream also weakens the coffee. Since the problem states that any added liquid weakens the coffee, we can assume that the cream also contributes to the weakening. Therefore, we add the weakening from the cream:

   \[
   \text{Weakening from cream} = 15 \text{ milliliters}
   \]

4. **Total Weakening**:
   Now, we can find the total weakening of the iced coffee by adding the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:

   \[
   \text{Total weakening} = \text{Weakening from ice cubes} + \text{Weakening from cream} = 60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
   \]

Thus, Shannon's iced coffee is **75 milliliters weaker** after cooling it by 65 degrees and adding 15 milliliters of cream.",0.00282,69.08103108406067,0.0,0.0,gpt-4o-mini,,,0

Where:
- \(M\) is the monthly payment

From the problem, we know:
- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- She gathers half of that from the shortest trees, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
- Therefore, the total number of apples Joanne gathers is:
  \[
  30 + 15 + x = 45 + x
  \]

Now, let's analyze the apples gathered by her sister:
- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- She gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- Her sister does not gather any apples from the average trees.

Thus, the total number of apples gathered by her sister is:
\[

Now, we can set up the equation for the combined total of apples gathered by both sisters:
\[
(45 + x) + 105 = 500

   \]

2. Camels have 2 humps each and dromedaries have 1 hump each. The total number of humps gives us the equation:
   \[

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. \( C + D = 180 \)  (Equation 1)
2. \( 2C + D = 304 \)  (Equation 2)

We can solve this system step by step.

First, we can solve Equation 1 for \( D \):
\[
D = 180 - C
\]

Next, we substitute \( D \) in Equation 2:
\[
2C + (180 - C) = 304

1. **Distance traveled in the first 4 days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day for 4 days.
   - Distance for the first 4 days = \( 200 \, \text{km/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 800 \, \text{km} \)

2. **Distance traveled in the next 2 days:**
   - He traveled only 30% of the distance traveled in the first 4 days over these 2 days.
   - 30% of 800 km = \( 0.30 \times 800 \, \text{km} = 240 \, \text{km} \)
   - Therefore, the total distance for the next 2 days = 240 km.

3. **Distance traveled on the next day:**
   - On this day, he wasn't traveling at all, so the distance = 0 km.

4. **Distance traveled in the second week (7 days):**
   - Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days.
   - Distance for the second week = \( 300 \, \text{km/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2100 \, \text{km} \)

5. **Total distance traveled during the trip:**
   - Total distance = Distance from the first 4 days + Distance from the next 2 days + Distance from the day he didn't travel + Distance from the second week
   - Total distance = \( 800 \, \text{km} + 240 \, \text{km} + 0 \, \text{km} + 2100 \, \text{km} \)

We know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches:
\[

Now, substituting the expression for \( Z \) into the equation for \( P \):
\[
5 = \frac{1}{4} Z

1. **Initial Preparation**: The caterer was told to prepare gourmet hot dogs for 36 guests. He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hot dogs. 
   - Half of 36 guests is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) guests.
   - If these 18 guests each have 2 hot dogs, the total number of hot dogs prepared is \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hot dogs.

2. **Guests Who Showed Up**: However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hot dog. 
   - This means all 40 guests wanted 2 hot dogs each.
   - The total number of hot dogs needed for 40 guests is \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \) hot dogs.

3. **Calculating Shortage**: The caterer only prepared 36 hot dogs, but 80 hot dogs were needed.
   - The shortage of hot dogs is \( 80 - 36 = 44 \) hot dogs.

4. **Distribution of Hot Dogs**: Since there are only 36 hot dogs available, we need to determine how many guests can get a second hot dog.
   - Each of the 36 hot dogs can be given to 36 guests, meaning 36 guests can have 1 hot dog each.
   - This leaves \( 40 - 36 = 4 \) guests who will not receive a hot dog at all.

5. **Conclusion**: Since all 36 guests who received a hot dog can only have one, and there are 4 guests left without any hot dogs, we conclude that:
   - **4 guests did not get a second hot dog**.

2. **Cost of Hotel:**
   - The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day.

1. **Cost of One Pack of Razors**: 
   - Each pack costs $4.00.

2. **Number of Packs Heather Buys**: 
   - Heather buys 2 packs.

3. **Total Cost Without Discounts**: 
   - Total cost = Cost per pack × Number of packs = $4.00 × 2 = $8.00.

4. **Buy One Get One Free Offer**: 
   - Since Heather buys 2 packs, she gets 1 pack free. Therefore, she only pays for 1 pack.

5. **Adjusted Total Cost After the Offer**: 
   - Total cost after the offer = Cost of 1 pack = $4.00.

6. **Applying the $2.00 Coupon**: 
   - Total cost after coupon = Total cost after the offer - Coupon value = $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

7. **Total Number of Razors**: 
   - Each pack contains 4 razors, and since she gets 2 packs (and 1 free), she has a total of 3 packs.
   - Total number of razors = 4 razors/pack × 3 packs = 12 razors.

8. **Cost Per Individual Razor**: 
   - Cost per razor = Total cost after coupon / Total number of razors = $2.00 / 12 = $0.1667.

9. **Convert to Cents**: 
   - Since 1 dollar = 100 cents, $0.1667 = 16.67 cents.

10. **Final Answer**: 
   - Rounding to the nearest cent, each individual razor costs approximately **17 cents**.

Thus, the cost of each individual razor after the discount is **17 cents**.",0.0026975999999999,86.32996487617493,0.0,0.0,gpt-4o-mini,,,0

1. **Bottom Layer (4 cheerleaders)**: The height of the cheerleaders in this layer is 64 inches (the height of the majority of the cheerleaders). Therefore, the height of the bottom layer is:
   \[
   \text{Height of bottom layer} = 64 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Second Layer (3 cheerleaders)**: The height of the cheerleaders in this layer is also 64 inches. Therefore, the height of the second layer is:
   \[
   \text{Height of second layer} = 64 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Third Layer (2 cheerleaders)**: The height of the cheerleaders in this layer is again 64 inches. Therefore, the height of the third layer is:
   \[
   \text{Height of third layer} = 64 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Top Layer (1 cheerleader)**: The shortest cheerleader is 60 inches tall. Therefore, the height of the top layer is:
   \[
   \text{Height of top layer} = 60 \text{ inches}
   \]

Now, we need to calculate the total height of the pyramid. The total height is the sum of the heights of each layer:

\[
\text{Total height} = \text{Height of bottom layer} + \text{Height of second layer} + \text{Height of third layer} + \text{Height of top layer}

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. The total number of insects collected is 43:

   L + D + B = 43
   \]

2. Lily found 7 more insects than David:
   \[
   L = D + 7
   \]

3. David found half of what Bodhi found:
   \[
   D = \frac{1}{2}B
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( L \) and \( D \) into the total equation.

First, substitute \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \) into \( L = D + 7 \):
\[
L = \frac{1}{2}B + 7
\]

Now substitute both \( L \) and \( D \) into the total equation:
\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}B + 7\right) + \frac{1}{2}B + B = 43
\]

Combine the terms:
\[
\frac{1}{2}B + \frac{1}{2}B + B + 7 = 43

1. **Cost and Output Analysis**:
   - A **2 x 4** costs **$4** and produces **200 sticks**.
   - A **2 x 8** costs **$6** and produces **400 sticks**.

2. **Cost per Stick Calculation**:
   - For a **2 x 4**:
     \[
     \text{Cost per stick} = \frac{4}{200} = 0.02 \text{ dollars per stick}

From the calculations, we can see that the **2 x 8** is cheaper per stick.

3. **Maximizing Sticks with Budget**:
   - Let's see how many **2 x 8** pieces Frederick can buy with his $24:
     \[
     \text{Number of 2 x 8 pieces} = \frac{24}{6} = 4

     - 3 pieces of **2 x 8** ($18) and 1 piece of **2 x 4** ($4):
       \[
       \text{Total sticks} = (3 \times 400) + (1 \times 200) = 1200 + 200 = 1400 \text{ sticks}

   - For Ophelia: \( S_O = C_O - 2 \)
   - For Jenna: \( S_J = C_J - 2 \)
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia: \( C_J = 3C_O \)

Since we know Ophelia has 20 sofas, we can set up the equation for Ophelia's sofas:

\[
S_O = 20
\]

Using the relationship between sofas and chairs for Ophelia:

\[
C_O - 2 = 20
\]

Solving for \( C_O \):

\[
C_O = 20 + 2 = 22
\]

Now we can find the number of chairs Jenna has using the relationship \( C_J = 3C_O \):

\[
C_J = 3 \times 22 = 66
\]

Next, we can find the number of sofas Jenna has using the relationship \( S_J = C_J - 2 \):

\[
S_J = 66 - 2 = 64

Now we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have:

- Total sofas: \( S_O + S_J = 20 + 64 = 84 \)
- Total chairs: \( C_O + C_J = 22 + 66 = 88 \)

Finally, the total number of sofas and chairs combined is:

gsm8k,gsm8k-532,SC-10,1,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age**:
   Jame will turn 27 in 5 years. Therefore, we can find his current age by subtracting 5 from 27:
   \[
   \text{Jame's current age} = 27 - 5 = 22 \text{ years old}
   \]

2. **Determine Jame's cousin's age in 8 years**:
   Let \( x \) be Jame's cousin's current age. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be \( x + 8 \).

3. **Set up the equation based on the cousin's age**:
   According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. In 8 years, Jame will be:
   \[
   22 + 8 = 30 \text{ years old}
   \]
   Therefore, twice Jame's age in 8 years is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60
   \]
   So, Jame's cousin's age in 8 years is:
   \[
   x + 8 = 60 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying this gives:
   \[
   x + 8 = 55
   \]
   Now, we can solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 55 - 8 = 47 \text{ years old}
   \]

4. **Calculate the age difference**:
   Now we know Jame is currently 22 years old and his cousin is currently 47 years old. The difference in their ages is:
   \[
   47 - 22 = 25 \text{ years}

     \]

3. **Total Cost of the Computer, Monitors, and Printer**: 
   - The total cost of all items is $2,400.

4. **Cost of the Monitors**: 
   - Let \( x \) be the cost of one monitor. Since Errol bought 2 monitors, the total cost for the monitors is \( 2x \).
   - The equation for the total cost can be set up as follows:
     \[
     \text{Cost of Computer} + \text{Cost of Printer} + \text{Cost of Monitors} = 2,400
     \]
     Substituting the known values:
     \[
     1,100 + 700 + 2x = 2,400
     \]

5. **Simplifying the Equation**:
   - Combine the known costs:
     \[
     1,800 + 2x = 2,400
     \]

6. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   - Subtract 1,800 from both sides:
     \[
     2x = 2,400 - 1,800
     \]
     \[
     2x = 600

1. **Identify the number of days in April**: April has 30 days.

2. **Divide the month into two halves**: 
   - The first half consists of the first 15 days (April 1 to April 15).
   - The second half consists of the last 15 days (April 16 to April 30).

3. **Let \( x \) be the amount saved per day in the first half**: 
   - Therefore, for the first half (15 days), the total savings will be \( 15x \).

4. **Savings in the second half**: 
   - According to the problem, Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half. Thus, he will save \( 2x \) per day in the second half.
   - For the second half (15 days), the total savings will be \( 15(2x) = 30x \).

5. **Total savings for the month**: 
   - The total savings for the month will be the sum of the savings from both halves:

\[
\text{Juan's coffee intake} = 10 \times \left(\frac{1}{2} R\right) = 5R
\]

Juan's doctor has advised him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. Therefore, we set up the equation:

  \]

- The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans:
  \[
  g = b + 0.01b = 1.01b
  \]

The total number of jelly beans in the jar is given as 4500. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[
r + b + g = 4500
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( r \) and \( g \) in terms of \( b \):
\[
0.99b + b + 1.01b = 4500
\]

Combining the terms:
\[

\]

Since the number of jelly beans must be a whole number, we round \( b \) to the nearest whole number:

gsm8k,gsm8k-593,SC-10,1,"To determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, we can model the growth of the beanstalk.

1. **Initial height of the beanstalk**: 4 feet
2. **Height of Mark's window**: 20 feet
3. **Growth pattern**: The beanstalk doubles its height every day.

We can express the height of the beanstalk after \( n \) days with the formula:

\[
\text{Height after } n \text{ days} = 4 \times 2^n
\]

We want to find the smallest \( n \) such that:

\[

Next, we can solve for \( n \) by finding the smallest integer \( n \) that satisfies this inequality. We can calculate the powers of 2:

- \( 2^0 = 1 \)
- \( 2^1 = 2 \)
- \( 2^2 = 4 \)
- \( 2^3 = 8 \)

We see that \( 2^3 = 8 \) is the first power of 2 that is greater than 5. Therefore, \( n = 3 \) is the smallest integer satisfying the inequality.

1. **Calculate the cost to repave Monica's street:**
   \[
   \text{Cost for Monica's street} = \text{Length of Monica's street} \times \text{Cost per meter}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost for Monica's street} = 150 \, \text{meters} \times 194 \, \text{dollars/meter} = 29100 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street:**
   \[

   \]
   \[
   \text{Difference in cost} = 95060 \, \text{dollars} - 29100 \, \text{dollars} = 65960 \, \text{dollars}

gsm8k,gsm8k-611,SC-10,1,"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we can break it down into two parts: the initial funding for the first 5 months and the funding for the additional months.

1. **Initial Funding for the First 5 Months:**
   - John received $100,000 for the first 5 months.
   - Therefore, the cost for the first 5 months is:
     \[
     \text{Cost for first 5 months} = 100,000
     \]

2. **Duration of Research:**
   - The research took 10 times longer than initially planned, which means:
     \[
     \text{Total duration} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ months}
     \]
   - The additional months beyond the initial 5 months is:
     \[
     \text{Additional months} = 50 - 5 = 45 \text{ months}
     \]

3. **Funding for Additional Months:**
   - The funding for each month after the first 5 months increases by 50% compared to the previous month.
   - The funding for the 6th month is:
     \[
     \text{Funding for month 6} = 100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000
     \]
   - The funding for the 7th month is:
     \[
     \text{Funding for month 7} = 150,000 \times 1.5 = 225,000
     \]
   - This pattern continues, where each month's funding is 1.5 times the previous month's funding.

4. **Calculating the Funding for Each of the Additional 45 Months:**
   - We can represent the funding for the \( n \)-th month after the first 5 months as:
     \[
     \text{Funding for month } n = 100,000 \times (1.5)^{n-5}
     \]
   - For the 6th month, \( n = 6 \):
     \[
     \text{Funding for month 6} = 100,000 \times (1.5)^{1} = 150,000
     \]
   - For the 7th month, \( n = 7 \):
     \[
     \text{Funding for month 7} = 100,000 \times (1.5)^{2} = 225,000
     \]
   - Continuing this way, we can find the total funding for the 45 additional months.

5. **Total Funding for Additional Months:**
   - The total funding for the additional months can be calculated using the formula for the sum of a geometric series:
     \[
     S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}
     \]
   - Where:
     - \( a = 150,000 \) (the first term of the series)
     - \( r = 1.5 \) (the common ratio)
     - \( n = 45 \) (the number of terms)
   - Thus, the total funding for the additional 45 months is:
     \[
     S_{45} = 150,000 \frac{1 - (1.5)^{45}}{1 - 1.5}
     \]
   - Simplifying this:
     \[
     S_{45} = 150,000 \frac{1 - (1.5)^{45}}{-0.5} = -300,000 (1 - (1.5)^{45})
     \]

6. **Calculating the Total Cost:**
   - Finally, the total cost of the research is the sum of the initial funding and the additional funding:
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = 100,000 + S_{45}
     \]

Now, let's calculate \( (1.5)^{45} \) and then compute \( S_{45} \) and the total cost.

Using a calculator:
- \( (1.5)^{45} \approx 11222.741 \)

Now substituting back:
\[
S_{45} = -300,000 (1 - 11222.741) \approx -300,000 \times -11221.741 \approx 3366522300
\]

Thus, the total cost:
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 100,000 + 3366522300 \approx 3366622300
\]

Therefore, the total cost of John's research is approximately **$3,366,622,300**.",0.0056763,113.68406677246094,0.0,0.0,gpt-4o-mini,,,0

Let:
- \( s \) = number of sheep
- \( g \) = number of geese

From the problem, we know:
1. Each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs. The total number of legs is 70:
   \[
   4s + 2g = 70
   \]
   
2. Each animal has 1 head. The total number of heads is 20:
   \[
   s + g = 20
   \]

Now we have the following system of equations:
1. \( 4s + 2g = 70 \)
2. \( s + g = 20 \)

We can solve this system step by step.

First, let's solve the second equation for \( g \):
\[
g = 20 - s
\]

Now, substitute \( g \) in the first equation:
\[
4s + 2(20 - s) = 70
\]

Distributing the 2:
\[
4s + 40 - 2s = 70
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
2s + 40 = 70
\]

Subtract 40 from both sides:
\[
2s = 30
\]

Now, divide by 2:
\[
s = 15
\]

Now that we have \( s \), we can find \( g \):
\[
g = 20 - s = 20 - 15 = 5

1. **Initial Situation**:
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. 
   - There are 8 more dogs in the shelter.
   - Total dogs = 4 (initial) + 8 (new) = 12 dogs.

2. **Toys Needed Initially**:
   - Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 12 toys for 12 dogs.

3. **Toys James Has**:
   - James currently has 4 toys.

4. **Toys James Needs to Buy Initially**:

5. **After Buying Toys**:
   - James now has 4 (initial) + 8 (bought) = 12 toys.

6. **Twice as Many More Dogs**:
   - After buying the toys, he finds there are twice as many more dogs than when he left.
   - When he left, there were 12 dogs. Twice as many more means:
     - Additional dogs = 12 (current) * 2 = 24 more dogs.
   - Total dogs now = 12 (current) + 24 (more) = 36 dogs.

7. **Toys Needed Now**:
   - James needs 36 toys for 36 dogs.

8. **Toys James Has After Buying**:
   - He still has 12 toys.

9. **Toys James Needs to Buy Again**:

- Let \( M \) be the number of cookies Max has.
- Let \( C \) be the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of cookies Summer has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. \( K = M - 5 \) (Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max)
2. \( M = C + 12 \) (Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster)
3. \( S = M + 23 \) (Summer has 23 more cookies than Max)
4. \( K = 68 \) (Katarina has 68 cookies)

Now, we can substitute \( K \) into the first equation:

\[
68 = M - 5
\]

Adding 5 to both sides gives:

\[
M = 68 + 5 = 73
\]

Now that we have \( M \), we can find \( C \) using the second equation:

\[
M = C + 12
\]

Substituting \( M = 73 \):

\[
73 = C + 12
\]

Subtracting 12 from both sides gives:

\[
C = 73 - 12 = 61

Next, we can find \( S \) using the third equation:

\[
S = M + 23
\]

Substituting \( M = 73 \):

\[
S = 73 + 23 = 96

Now we have the number of cookies for each person:

- Katarina: \( K = 68 \)
- Max: \( M = 73 \)
- Cookie Monster: \( C = 61 \)

Topher's shoe length is 8 feet and 4 inches. We convert this to inches:

1. Convert feet to inches:
   \[
   8 \text{ feet} = 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ inches}

So, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches.

Next, we know from the problem statement that the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. We can express this relationship mathematically.

Let \( b \) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. According to the problem, we have the equation:

2. **Science books**: Each science book also weighs 2 pounds. Let's assume she has \( s \) science books. The total weight of the science books is \( 2s \) pounds.

3. **French book**: The French book weighs 4 pounds.

4. **English book**: The English book weighs 3 pounds.

5. **History book**: The history book weighs twice as much as the English book. Since the English book weighs 3 pounds, the history book weighs \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total weight of all the books:

\[
\text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of math books} + \text{Weight of science books} + \text{Weight of French book} + \text{Weight of English book} + \text{Weight of history book}

1. **Initial Stickers**:
   - Lorraine starts with:
     - 30 small stickers
     - 40 large stickers

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons**:
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers:
     - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers
   - Since each large sticker is worth 1 large button, she can trade 27 small stickers for:
     - 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons (since 1 small sticker = 1 small button)
   - Therefore, she receives 27 small buttons from this trade.

3. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons**:
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers:
     - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers
   - Each large sticker is worth 1 large button, so she receives:
     - 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons from this trade.

4. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons**:
   - After trading 20 large stickers, Lorraine has:
     - 40 large stickers - 20 large stickers = 20 large stickers remaining.
   - Each large button is worth 3 small stickers, so she can trade her remaining large stickers for small buttons:
     - 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons = 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250:
   \[
   x + y + z = 250
   \]

2. The first house needs half of what the second house needs:
   \[
   x = \frac{1}{2}y
   \]

3. The third house needs double what the first house needs:
   \[
   z = 2x
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( x \) and \( z \) in terms of \( y \) into the total equation.

First, substitute \( x = \frac{1}{2}y \) into \( z = 2x \):
\[
z = 2\left(\frac{1}{2}y\right) = y
\]

Now, substitute \( x \) and \( z \) into the total equation:
\[
\frac{1}{2}y + y + y = 250
\]

Combine the terms:
\[
\frac{1}{2}y + 2y = 250
\]
\[
\frac{1}{2}y + \frac{4}{2}y = 250
\]
\[
\frac{5}{2}y = 250

Now, solve for \( y \):
\[
y = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} = 100

Now that we have \( y \), we can find \( x \) and \( z \):
\[
x = \frac{1}{2}y = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50

gsm8k,gsm8k-779,SC-10,1,"To find the distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot, we can break down the problem into two parts: the driving distance and the hiking distance.

1. **Driving Speed and Time**:
   - The average driving speed is 50 miles per hour.
   - The total time for the trip is 6 hours, and they spent 1.5 hours hiking.
   - Therefore, the time spent driving is:
     \[
     \text{Time driving} = \text{Total time} - \text{Time hiking} = 6 \text{ hours} - 1.5 \text{ hours} = 4.5 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Distance Driven**:
   - The distance driven can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Distance driven} = 50 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4.5 \text{ hours} = 225 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Hiking Speed**:
   - The hiking speed is given as 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
   - Half of the driving speed is:
     \[
     \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ miles/hour}
     \]
   - Therefore, the hiking speed is:
     \[
     \text{Hiking speed} = 25 \text{ miles/hour} - 5 \text{ miles/hour} = 20 \text{ miles/hour}
     \]

4. **Distance Hiked**:

- Let \( E \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- Let \( B \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
- Let \( T \) be the time (in seconds) Emma has left when she finishes the level.

From the problem, we know:

- Ava jumps on \( E + 8 \) enemies.
- Ava collects \( B + 3 \) berries.
- Ava finishes the level \( T - 4 \) seconds slower than Emma, which means Ava has \( T - 4 \) seconds left.

Now, we can calculate the scores for both Ava and Emma using the scoring system provided:

**Emma's Score:**
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Emma}} = 10E + 5B + 30T
\]

**Ava's Score:**
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10(E + 8) + 5(B + 3) + 30(T - 4)
\]

Now, let's expand Ava's score:

\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120
\]
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10E + 5B + 30T - 25
\]

Now we can find the difference between Ava's score and Emma's score:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} - \text{Score}_{\text{Emma}}
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = (10E + 5B + 30T - 25) - (10E + 5B + 30T)
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = -25
\]

Thus, the difference between Ava's score and Emma's score is \(-25\). This means Ava's score is 25 points lower than Emma's score.

**Final Answer:**
The difference between their two scores is 25 points, with Emma having the higher score.",0.0029363999999999,64.78868103027344,0.0,0.0,gpt-4o-mini,,,1

Initially, Bob had:
- 3 orange fish
- 4 white fish

After buying the fish, the total number of orange fish becomes \( 3 + x \) and the total number of white fish becomes \( 4 + y \).

According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob found that he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[
3 + x = 2(4 + y)
\]

We also know that Bob bought a total of 17 fish:

\[
x + y = 17
\]

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. \( 3 + x = 2(4 + y) \)
2. \( x + y = 17 \)

Let's solve the first equation:

\[
3 + x = 8 + 2y
\]
\[
x - 2y = 5 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]

Now, we can use the second equation:

\[
x + y = 17 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\]

From Equation 2, we can express \( x \) in terms of \( y \):

\[
x = 17 - y
\]

Now, substitute \( x \) in Equation 1:

\[
(17 - y) - 2y = 5
\]
\[
17 - 3y = 5
\]
\[
-3y = 5 - 17
\]
\[
-3y = -12
\]
\[
y = 4

Now that we have \( y \), we can find \( x \):

\[
x = 17 - y = 17 - 4 = 13

Thus, Bob bought:
- \( x = 13 \) orange fish
- \( y = 4 \) white fish

Therefore, the number of white fish Bob bought at the store is \( \boxed{4} \).",0.0029859,69.15824604034424,0.0,0.0,gpt-4o-mini,,,1

gsm8k,gsm8k-802,SC-10,1,"To determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we first need to calculate the total number of stuffed animals she currently has.

Bubbles has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

Calculating the total:

\[
\text{Total stuffed animals} = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14
\]

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles wants to buy. After buying the goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be:

\[
\text{Total stuffed animals after buying goats} = 14 + x
\]

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. The number of stuffed goats is \( x \), so we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30
\]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply both sides by \( 14 + x \):

\[
x = 0.30(14 + x)
\]

Expanding the right side:

\[
x = 4.2 + 0.30x
\]

Now, we can isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( 0.30x \) from both sides:

\[
x - 0.30x = 4.2
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
0.70x = 4.2
\]

Now, divide both sides by 0.70 to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} = 6
\]

Thus, Bubbles should buy **6 stuffed goats**. 

To verify, we can check the total number of stuffed animals after buying the goats:

\[
\text{Total stuffed animals} = 14 + 6 = 20
\]

Now, the percentage of stuffed goats is:

\[
\frac{6}{20} = 0.30 \text{ or } 30\%

1. **First batch of flowers:**
   - Number of flowers: 3
   - Petals per flower: 5
   - Total petals: \(3 \times 5 = 15\)

2. **Second batch of flowers:**
   - Number of flowers: 4
   - Petals per flower: 6
   - Total petals: \(4 \times 6 = 24\)

3. **Third batch of flowers:**
   - Number of flowers: 5

4. **Fourth batch of flowers:**
   - Number of flowers: 6
   - Petals per flower: 7
   - Total petals: \(6 \times 7 = 42\)

Now, let's sum the total petals from all the flowers before any are dropped:

\[
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101
\]

Next, we account for the flowers that Rose drops. She drops 1 flower from each batch:

- From the first batch (5 petals): 1 flower dropped → 5 petals lost
- From the second batch (6 petals): 1 flower dropped → 6 petals lost
- From the third batch (4 petals): 1 flower dropped → 4 petals lost
- From the fourth batch (7 petals): 1 flower dropped → 7 petals lost

Now, let's calculate the total petals lost:

\[
5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22

1. **Calculate the total number of marshmallows used for S'mores:**
   - John makes 9 S'mores, using 9 marshmallows.
   - DeSean also makes 9 S'mores, using another 9 marshmallows.
   - Total marshmallows used for S'mores = 9 (John) + 9 (DeSean) = 18 marshmallows.

2. **Calculate the number of marshmallows dropped:**
   - They dropped 3 marshmallows.

3. **Calculate the total number of marshmallows used and dropped:**

1. **Jack's Play Time:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter.
   - In 4 hours (which is 240 minutes), the number of quarters Jack uses is:
     \[
     \text{Quarters used by Jack} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters}
     \]

2. **Friend 1's Play Time (significantly worse):**
   - This friend can play for half as long as Jack, which is:
     \[
     \text{Play time} = \frac{20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 10 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - The number of quarters this friend uses in 4 hours is:
     \[
     \text{Quarters used by Friend 1} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters}
     \]

3. **Friend 2's Play Time (also significantly worse):**
   - This friend has the same play time as Friend 1, so they also play for 10 minutes.
   - The number of quarters this friend uses is the same:
     \[
     \text{Quarters used by Friend 2} = 24 \text{ quarters}
     \]

4. **Friend 3's Play Time (significantly better):**
   - This friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is:
     \[
     \text{Play time} = 20 \text{ minutes} \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - The number of quarters this friend uses in 4 hours is:
     \[
     \text{Quarters used by Friend 3} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters}

- \( S \): salt
- \( O \): oil
- \( F \): fragrance
- \( Z \): citrus zest
- \( U \): sugar

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. \( Z = F \) (the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance)
2. \( S = U \) (the same amount of salt as sugar)
3. \( O = 2S \) (twice as much oil as salt)
4. \( S = 2Z \) (twice as much salt as zest)

We also know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces:

\[
S + O + F + Z + U = 10
\]

Now, we can express everything in terms of \( Z \):

From \( S = 2Z \):
- \( U = S = 2Z \)

From \( F = Z \):
- \( F = Z \)

From \( O = 2S \):
- \( O = 2(2Z) = 4Z \)

Now we can substitute these into the total equation:

\[
S + O + F + Z + U = 10
\]

Substituting the expressions we found:

\[
2Z + 4Z + Z + Z + 2Z = 10

Boris produces a total of 50,000 bars each month. To find out how much he produces in the fourth week, we subtract the total production of the first three weeks from the monthly total:
\[
\text{Fourth week production} = 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars}
\]

Thus, Boris produces **14,000 bars** in the fourth week.",0.0018830999999999,59.07162618637085,0.0,0.0,gpt-4o-mini,,,1
gsm8k,gsm8k-830,SC-10,1,"To calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to consider the time spent on filming videos, writing songs, and doing her makeup.

1. **Time spent filming TikTok videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Total time spent on videos per week = 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes.
   - In a month (4 weeks), the total time spent on videos = 72 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 288 minutes.

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - In a month, the total time spent writing songs = 2 hours/week * 4 weeks = 8 hours.
   - Convert hours to minutes: 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.

3. **Time spent doing makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes doing her makeup each day for 6 days a week.
   - Total time spent on makeup per week = 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes.
   - In a month, the total time spent on makeup = 90 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 360 minutes.

Now, we can add all these times together:

- Time spent on videos: 288 minutes
- Time spent writing songs: 480 minutes
- Time spent doing makeup: 360 minutes

Total time spent on TikTok in a month = 288 + 480 + 360 = 1128 minutes.

Therefore, Britany spends **1128 minutes** on TikTok in a month with four weeks.",0.0025293,74.55596876144409,0.0,0.0,gpt-4o-mini,,,1
gsm8k,gsm8k-831,SC-10,1,"To calculate the total cost for Angela's installation, we need to break down the costs based on the items she has and the firm's pricing structure.

1. **Base Installation Cost**: The base cost for installation is $129.00, which includes:
   - 4 mirrors
   - 2 shelves
   - 1 chandelier
   - 10 pictures

2. **Items Angela has**:
   - Mirrors: 6
   - Shelves: 0 (she needs to install 2 shelves, but she doesn't have any)
   - Chandeliers: 2
   - Pictures: 20

3. **Calculate additional items**:
   - **Mirrors**: Angela has 6 mirrors, and the base installation covers 4 mirrors. Therefore, she has 2 additional mirrors.
   - **Shelves**: She needs to install 2 shelves, and she has none, so she needs to install 2 additional shelves.
   - **Chandeliers**: Angela has 2 chandeliers, and the base installation covers 1 chandelier. Therefore, she has 1 additional chandelier.
   - **Pictures**: Angela has 20 pictures, and the base installation covers 10 pictures. Therefore, she has 10 additional pictures.

4. **Total additional items**:
   - Additional mirrors: 2
   - Additional shelves: 2
   - Additional chandeliers: 1
   - Additional pictures: 10

   Total additional items = 2 + 2 + 1 + 10 = 15 additional items.

5. **Cost for additional items**: The cost for each additional item is $15.00.
   - Total cost for additional items = 15 items × $15.00/item = $225.00.

6. **Total cost**: 
   - Total cost = Base installation cost + Cost for additional items
   - Total cost = $129.00 + $225.00 = $354.00.

Therefore, the total cost for Angela's installation will be **$354.00**.",0.0025694999999999,65.1680200099945,0.0,0.0,gpt-4o-mini,,,0
gsm8k,gsm8k-832,SC-10,1,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Eva's savings**: 
   - Eva has saved $20.00.

2. **Calculate Anthony's savings**: 
   - Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva.
   - So, Anthony's savings = Eva's savings + $10.00
   - Anthony's savings = $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

3. **Calculate Roy's savings**: 
   - Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony.
   - First, we need to find 40% of Anthony's savings.
   - 40% of $30.00 = 0.40 × $30.00 = $12.00.
   - Now, add this amount to Anthony's savings to find Roy's savings.
   - Roy's savings = Anthony's savings + 40% of Anthony's savings
   - Roy's savings = $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

Therefore, Roy has saved **$42.00**.",0.0015276,43.20605278015137,0.0,0.0,gpt-4o-mini,,,1
