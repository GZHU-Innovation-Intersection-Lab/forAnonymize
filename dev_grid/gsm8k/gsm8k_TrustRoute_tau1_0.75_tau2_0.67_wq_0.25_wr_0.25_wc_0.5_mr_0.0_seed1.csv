1. **Calculate the total investment**: This includes the purchase price of the house and the cost of repairs.
   \[
   \text{Total Investment} = \text{Purchase Price} + \text{Repair Costs} = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000

2. **Determine the increased value of the house**: The value of the house increased by 150%. To find the new value, we first calculate 150% of the original purchase price.
   \[
   \text{Increase in Value} = 150\% \times \text{Purchase Price} = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000

### Step 1: Downloads in the first month
- The program had 60 downloads in the first month.

### Step 2: Downloads in the second month
- The second month's downloads were three times the first month's downloads.
- So, second month downloads = 3 × 60 = 180.

### Step 3: Downloads in the third month
- The third month's downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month's downloads.
- This means the third month is 70% of the second month's downloads (since 100% - 30% = 70%).
- So, third month downloads = 180 × 0.70 = 126.

### Step 4: Total downloads over the three months

gsm8k,gsm8k-12,TrustRoute,1,"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to compare his total costs (initial planting cost plus annual maintenance) with his total revenue (from selling lemons). We'll calculate this step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the costs and revenues
- **Initial cost**: $90 (one-time cost to plant the tree).
- **Annual cost**: $3 per year (for watering and feeding).
- **Annual revenue**: The tree produces 7 lemons per year, and each lemon sells for $1.5.
  - Revenue per year = 7 lemons × $1.5/ lemon = $10.50.

After \( y \) years:
- Total cost = Initial cost + Annual cost × y = $90 + $3y.
- Total revenue = Annual revenue × y = $10.50y.

Carlos starts earning money when his total revenue exceeds his total cost, meaning he has a positive profit.

### Step 2: Set up the inequality
We need to find the smallest integer \( y \) where:
\[
10.50y > 90 + 3y
\]

Subtract \( 3y \) from both sides:
\[
10.50y - 3y > 90
\]
\[
7.50y > 90
\]

Divide both sides by 7.50:
\[
y > \frac{90}{7.50}
\]
\[
y > 12
\]

So, \( y \) must be greater than 12. Since \( y \) represents years, it must be a whole number, the smallest of which is 13.

### Step 3: Verify with calculations
- **At 12 years**:
  - Total cost = $90 + $3 × 12 = $90 + $36 = $126.
  - Total revenue = $10.50 × 12 = $126.
  - Profit = Revenue - Cost = $126 - $126 = $0 (he breaks even, but hasn't started earning yet).

- **At 13 years**:
  - Total cost = $90 + $3 × 13 = $90 + $39 = $129.
  - Total revenue = $10.50 × 13 = $136.50.
  - Profit = Revenue - Cost = $136.50 - $129 = $7.50 (now positive).

### Conclusion
It will take **13 years** for Carlos to start earning money from the lemon tree, as this is when his total revenue first exceeds his total costs, resulting in a profit.",0.00912762,25.505928993225098,0,0,cand-grok-3-mini,stage2_confidence,

**Step 1: Set up the problem using the ratio**

If their ages are in the ratio 7:11, I can express their ages as:
- Darrell's age = 7x
- Allen's age = 11x

where x is a common multiplier.

**Step 2: Use the total age to find x**

Their total age is 162, so:

According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110:
   \[
   S + G = 110
   \]

2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins:
   \[
   G = S + 30
   \]

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation. Replacing \( G \) in the first equation gives us:
\[
S + (S + 30) = 110
\]

Simplifying this, we get:
\[
2S + 30 = 110
\]

Next, we subtract 30 from both sides:
\[
2S = 80
\]

Now, divide both sides by 2:
\[
S = 40

Now that we have the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:

According to the problem, we have the following two equations:

1. The total number of games played is 22:
   \[
   W + L = 22
   \]

2. The team won 8 more games than they lost:

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation. 

Substituting \( W \) in the first equation:

### Step 1: Understand the problem
- Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's.
- Together, they sold 88,000 copies.
- We need to find out how many copies Harald sold.

### Step 2: Define the variables
- Let \( H \) represent the number of copies Harald sold.
- Then, Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies (since it's 10 times as many as Harald's).

### Step 3: Set up the equation
- The total copies sold is the sum of Harald's and Marilyn's sales:
  \[
  H + 10H = 88,000
  \]
- Simplify the equation:
  \[
  11H = 88,000
  \]

### Step 4: Solve for \( H \)
- Divide both sides by 11:
  \[
  H = \frac{88,000}{11} = 8,000
  \]
- So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

### Step 5: Verify the solution
- If Harald sold 8,000 copies, then Marilyn sold \( 10 \times 8,000 = 80,000 \) copies.
- Total: \( 8,000 + 80,000 = 88,000 \), which matches the given information.

gsm8k,gsm8k-116,TrustRoute,1,"To solve the problem, we start by defining the ratio of sugar to water, which is given as 7:13. This means that for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water.

First, we can find the total number of parts in the ratio:

\[
7 \text{ (sugar)} + 13 \text{ (water)} = 20 \text{ parts}
\]

Next, we know that the total amount of sugar and water combined is 120 teaspoons. We can set up the equation based on the ratio:

Let \( x \) be the common multiplier for the parts of sugar and water. Then we can express the amounts of sugar and water as follows:

- Amount of sugar = \( 7x \)
- Amount of water = \( 13x \)

Adding these gives us the total:

\[
7x + 13x = 120
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
20x = 120
\]

Now, we can solve for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{120}{20} = 6
\]

Now that we have \( x \), we can find the amount of sugar used:

\[
\text{Amount of sugar} = 7x = 7 \times 6 = 42 \text{ teaspoons}

Thus, Katy used **42 teaspoons of sugar**.",0.0026829500000000004,15.611244201660156,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,

gsm8k,gsm8k-119,TrustRoute,1,"To solve the problem, we will first determine Lylah's salary based on the information provided about Adrien's salary.

1. **Calculate Lylah's salary four years ago:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago = $40,000
   - Adrien's salary is 30% higher than Lylah's salary.
   - Let Lylah's salary be \( L \).
   - According to the problem, we have:
     \[
     40000 = L + 0.3L
     \]
     \[
     40000 = 1.3L
     \]
   - Solving for \( L \):
     \[
     L = \frac{40000}{1.3} \approx 30769.23
     \]

2. **Calculate Adrien's salary four years later:**
   - Adrien's salary increased by 40% over the four years.
   - New salary of Adrien:
     \[
     \text{New Adrien's salary} = 40000 + 0.4 \times 40000 = 40000 + 16000 = 56000
     \]

3. **Calculate Lylah's salary four years later:**
   - Since both salaries increased simultaneously, we need to find the percentage increase for Lylah's salary. However, the problem does not specify the exact percentage increase for Lylah. For simplicity, we will assume that Lylah's salary also increased by the same percentage as Adrien's, which is 40%.
   - New salary of Lylah:
     \[
     \text{New Lylah's salary} = 30769.23 + 0.4 \times 30769.23 \approx 30769.23 + 12307.69 \approx 43076.92
     \]

4. **Calculate the total salary four years later:**
   - Total salary four years later:

     \]
     \[
     \text{Total salary} = 56000 + 43076.92 \approx 99076.92

From the first statement: ""Seth is twice as old as Brooke.""
We can write this as an equation:
S = 2B  (Equation 1)

From the second statement: ""In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28.""
In 2 years, Seth's age will be S + 2.
In 2 years, Brooke's age will be B + 2.
The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28:
(S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28

Let's simplify the second equation:
S + B + 4 = 28
S + B = 28 - 4
S + B = 24  (Equation 2)

Now we have a system of two linear equations:
1) S = 2B
2) S + B = 24

We can use the substitution method. Substitute the value of S from Equation 1 into Equation 2:
(2B) + B = 24
3B = 24

Now, solve for B:
B = 24 / 3
B = 8

So, Brooke's current age is 8 years old.

The question asks for Seth's age. We can use Equation 1 to find Seth's age:
S = 2B
S = 2 * 8
S = 16

So, Seth's current age is 16 years old.

Let's check our answer:
Seth's current age = 16
Brooke's current age = 8
Is Seth twice as old as Brooke? 16 = 2 * 8 (Yes)

In 2 years:
Seth's age will be 16 + 2 = 18.

**Team B (Less well-rounded team):**
- The first runner runs their leg in 60 seconds.
- The second runner runs 3 seconds faster than the first, so they run in \(60 - 3 = 57\) seconds.
- The third runner runs 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run in \(57 - 3 = 54\) seconds.
- The fourth runner runs 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run in \(54 - 3 = 51\) seconds.

Now, we can calculate the total time for Team B:

2. **Calculate the straw used for hamsters**:
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster receives 5 pieces of straw.
   - Let \( h \) be the number of hamsters in each cage.
   - Total straw for hamsters = \( 10 \times h \times 5 = 50h \).

   - Testing integer values for \( h \):

   - For \( h = 0 \):

- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (as a decimal).

   3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week}
   \]

2. **Convert the weekly requirement to a daily requirement**:
   There are 7 days in a week, so to find the daily requirement, we divide the total weekly requirement by 7:
   \[
   \frac{35 \text{ pounds/week}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 5 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

Therefore, the flock of ten ducks needs **5 pounds of insects per day**.",0.0017978500000000001,9.540650129318237,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.

2. **Net trees planted per year**: 
   - Tom plants 10 trees each year.
   - He chops down 2 trees each year.
   - Therefore, the net increase in trees per year is:
     \[
     10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
     \]

3. **Total trees after 10 years**:
   - Over 10 years, the total increase in trees is:
     \[
     8 \text{ trees/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 80 \text{ trees}
     \]
   - Adding this to the initial number of trees:
     \[
     50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees}
     \]

4. **Percentage of trees that die after 10 years**:
   - After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. 
   - The number of trees that die is:
     \[
     0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees}
     \]

5. **Calculating the remaining trees**:
   - The number of trees left after the deaths is:
     \[
     130 - 39 = 91 \text{ trees}
     \]

Thus, after 10 years, Tom has **91 trees left**.",0.0027443500000000004,14.010549306869507,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,

1. **Initial Flamingos**: On Friday, Sue has 18 pink flamingos in her yard.

2. **Flamingos Taken Back and Painted**: On Saturday, the neighbors take back one third of the flamingos. 
   - One third of 18 is calculated as:
     \[
     \frac{18}{3} = 6
     \]
   - So, 6 flamingos are taken back and painted white.

3. **Flamingos After Painting**: After painting, the number of flamingos in Sue's yard is:
   - Pink flamingos left: 
     \[
     18 - 6 = 12
     \]
   - White flamingos added: 6

4. **Total Flamingos After Painting**: At this point, Sue has:
   - 12 pink flamingos
   - 6 white flamingos

5. **Adding More Pink Flamingos**: On Sunday, the neighbors add another 18 pink flamingos to the yard.
   - Total pink flamingos now:
     \[
     12 + 18 = 30

1. **Calculate the cost of a pencil and an eraser combined:**
   - Cost of a pencil = $1.20
   - Cost of an eraser = $0.30
   - Combined cost = Cost of pencil + Cost of eraser
   \[
   \text{Combined cost} = 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50

gsm8k,gsm8k-199,TrustRoute,1,"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the payment from Publisher A:**
   - Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of sentences Mark edits for Publisher A.
   - Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, he also edits \( x \) sentences for Publisher B.
   - Therefore, the total number of sentences he edits is \( x + x = 2x \).

2. **Total sentences edited:**
   - We know that Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week.
   - So, we have:
     \[
     2x = 1000
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{1000}{2} = 500
     \]
   - Thus, Mark edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B.

3. **Determine the payment from Publisher B:**
   - Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays.
   - Therefore, Publisher B pays:
     \[
     2 \times 5 \text{ cents} = 10 \text{ cents per sentence}
     \]

4. **Calculate total earnings:**
   - Earnings from Publisher A:
     \[
     \text{Earnings from A} = 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents}
     \]
   - Earnings from Publisher B:
     \[
     \text{Earnings from B} = 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents}
     \]

5. **Total earnings for the week:**
   - Total earnings = Earnings from A + Earnings from B:
     \[
     \text{Total earnings} = 2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents}
