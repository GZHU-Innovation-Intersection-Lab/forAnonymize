gsm8k,gsm8k-205,TrustRoute-NoParallel,1,"I need to find what score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after removing her lowest score.

Let me work through this step-by-step.

**Given information:**
- First five test scores: 89, 71, 92, 100, 86
- The lowest score will be removed from the average
- Target average: 93
- Total tests: 6

**Step 1: Identify the current lowest score**
Looking at the five scores: 89, 71, 92, 100, 86
The lowest score is 71.

**Step 2: Determine what happens with different sixth test scores**

Let's call the sixth test score x.

**Case 1: If x ≥ 71**
Then 71 remains the lowest and will be dropped.
The five scores used for the average would be: 89, 92, 100, 86, and x

For an average of 93:
(89 + 92 + 100 + 86 + x) / 5 = 93
(367 + x) / 5 = 93
367 + x = 465
x = 98

**Case 2: If x < 71**
Then x would be the lowest and will be dropped.
The five scores used would be: 89, 71, 92, 100, 86

Average = (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86) / 5 = 438 / 5 = 87.6

This is less than 93, so this case won't work.

**Verification:**
If Brinley scores 98 on the sixth test:
- All six scores: 89, 71, 92, 100, 86, 98
- Remove lowest (71): 89, 92, 100, 86, 98
- Average: (89 + 92 + 100 + 86 + 98) / 5 = 465 / 5 = 93 ✓

**Given information:**
- Twenty dozen cups cost some amount
- Half a dozen plates cost $6000 each
- The cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of the plates

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the plates**
- Half a dozen = 6 ÷ 2 = 6 plates (Note: ""half a dozen"" means 6 items, not half of a dozen)
- Actually, let me reconsider: ""half a dozen plates"" = 0.5 × 12 = 6 plates
- Each plate costs $6000
- Total cost of plates = 6 × $6000 = $36,000

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the cups**
- The cups cost $1200 less than the plates
- Total cost of cups = $36,000 - $1,200 = $34,800

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of each cup**
- Twenty dozen cups = 20 × 12 = 240 cups
- Total cost of 240 cups = $34,800
- Cost per cup = $34,800 ÷ 240 = $145

- Class 2 has 12 girls

**Step 1: Calculate total students in the school**
Total students = 3 classes × 20 students/class = 60 students

**Step 2: Calculate total boys and girls in the school**
Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls:
- Total girls = 60 × 0.5 = 30 girls
- Total boys = 60 × 0.5 = 30 boys

**Step 3: Calculate girls in class 1 and class 2**
- Class 1: 15 girls
- Class 2: 12 girls
- Total girls in classes 1 and 2 = 15 + 12 = 27 girls

**Step 4: Calculate girls in class 3**
Girls in class 3 = Total girls - Girls in classes 1 and 2
Girls in class 3 = 30 - 27 = 3 girls

**Step 5: Calculate boys in class 3**
Since each class has 20 students:
Boys in class 3 = 20 - 3 = 17 boys

**Given information:**
- The sum of Mico's and Marco's current ages is 20

**Question:**
- What will be the sum of their ages in 10 years?

**Solution:**

Let me denote:
- Mico's current age = M
- Marco's current age = R

**Current situation:**
M + R = 20

**In 10 years:**
- Mico's age will be: M + 10
- Marco's age will be: R + 10

**Sum of their ages in 10 years:**
(M + 10) + (R + 10)
= M + R + 10 + 10
= M + R + 20
= 20 + 20

**Let me define variables:**
- Let Sam's current age = S
- Let Ruby's current age = R

**Set up equations from the given information:**

1) ""Ruby is 6 times older than Sam"" (now):
   R = 6S

2) ""In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam"":
   R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

**Solve the system of equations:**

From equation 2:
R + 9 = 3S + 27
R = 3S + 18

Now I have two expressions for R:
- R = 6S (from equation 1)
- R = 3S + 18 (from equation 2)

Setting them equal:
6S = 3S + 18
6S - 3S = 18
3S = 18
S = 6

- Sam's current age: 6 years old
- Ruby's current age: 6 × 6 = 36 years old

- Number of flagstones: 80
- Weight per flagstone: 75 pounds
- Total weight = 80 × 75 = 6,000 pounds

**Step 2: Calculate how many flagstones one truck can carry**
- Truck capacity: 2,000 pounds
- Flagstones per truck = 2,000 ÷ 75 = 26.67 flagstones
- Since we can't split flagstones, one truck can carry 26 flagstones (26 × 75 = 1,950 pounds)

gsm8k,gsm8k-301,TrustRoute-NoParallel,1,"I need to figure out how many pieces of paper are needed for a 32-page tabloid with the folding method described.

Let me think through this step by step:

## Understanding the Folding Method

1. **One piece of paper is folded vertically** (folded in half)
2. **This creates 4 printable surfaces** (2 on each side of the fold):
   - Left back (page 1)
   - Left front (page 2)
   - Right front (page 31)
   - Right back (page 32)

## Calculating Pages per Sheet

When you fold one piece of paper in half:
- You get 2 leaves (the left half and right half)
- Each leaf has 2 sides (front and back)
- Total: **4 pages per sheet of paper**

## Finding the Number of Sheets

For a 32-page tabloid:
- Total pages needed: 32
- Pages per sheet: 4
- Number of sheets = 32 ÷ 4 = **8 sheets**

## Verification

Let me verify with the page numbering pattern:
- Sheet 1: pages 1, 2, 31, 32
- Sheet 2: pages 3, 4, 29, 30
- Sheet 3: pages 5, 6, 27, 28
- Sheet 4: pages 7, 8, 25, 26
- Sheet 5: pages 9, 10, 23, 24
- Sheet 6: pages 11, 12, 21, 22
- Sheet 7: pages 13, 14, 19, 20
- Sheet 8: pages 15, 16, 17, 18

- Current year sales: 45 books
- First year sales: twice the current year = 2 × 45 = 90 books

Let me break this down step by step:

**Given information:**
- Watson works 10 hours per day
- He works 5 days per week
- He earns $10 per hour
- He gets a $300 bonus each week when the company performs well
- The company performed very well for the whole month of April

**Step 1: Calculate hours worked per week**
- Hours per week = 10 hours/day × 5 days/week = 50 hours/week

**Step 2: Calculate hourly earnings per week**
- Hourly earnings per week = 50 hours × $10/hour = $500/week

**Step 3: Calculate total earnings per week (including bonus)**
- Total per week = $500 (hourly) + $300 (bonus) = $800/week

**Step 4: Determine number of weeks in April**
- April has 30 days
- Number of weeks = 30 days ÷ 7 days/week ≈ 4.29 weeks
- Since Watson works 5 days per week, April contains approximately 4 full weeks (4 weeks × 7 days = 28 days, leaving 2 extra days)
- However, for a typical work month calculation, we should count: 30 days ÷ 7 days = 4 complete weeks + 2 days
- But more practically: April has either 4 or 5 work weeks depending on the calendar

**Most standard interpretation: April has 4 complete weeks**

**Step 5: Calculate total earnings for April**
- Total earnings = $800/week × 4 weeks = **$3,200**

- Total equipment worth: $400,000
- Faulty equipment: 40% of the total value
- The faulty equipment was returned

**Step 1: Calculate the value of faulty equipment**
Faulty equipment value = 40% of $400,000

- Principal: $3,650
- Time period: 5 months
- Interest rate: 10% (I'll assume this is annual interest rate)
- Equal monthly payments

Let me work through this step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate the total interest**

For a simple interest loan:
- Interest = Principal × Rate × Time
- Time = 5 months = 5/12 years
- Interest = $3,650 × 10% × (5/12)
- Interest = $3,650 × 0.10 × (5/12)
- Interest = $365 × (5/12)
- Interest = $152.08 (rounded to 2 decimal places)

**Step 2: Calculate the total amount to be repaid**

Total amount = Principal + Interest
Total amount = $3,650 + $152.08
Total amount = $3,802.08

**Step 3: Calculate the monthly payment**

Monthly payment = Total amount ÷ Number of months
Monthly payment = $3,802.08 ÷ 5
Monthly payment = $760.42 (rounded to 2 decimal places)

**Answer: Karan has to pay $760.42 per month.**

Let me work through this step by step.

**Given information:**
- Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land
- He had 12.8 hectares left

**Step 1: Determine what fraction of land is left**

If he sold 3/5 of his land, then the remaining land is:
- Remaining = 1 - 3/5 = 5/5 - 3/5 = 2/5

**Step 2: Set up the equation**

Let x = the original amount of land

We know that 2/5 of the original land equals 12.8 hectares:
- (2/5) × x = 12.8

**Step 3: Solve for x**

x = 12.8 ÷ (2/5)

x = 12.8 × (5/2)

x = 12.8 × 2.5

x = 32

- Camels have 2 humps each
- Dromedaries have 1 hump each

**Setting up equations:**

Let me define:
- c = number of camels
- d = number of dromedaries

From the problem, I can write two equations:

1. **Heads equation:** c + d = 180

2. **Humps equation:** 2c + d = 304
   (Camels have 2 humps, dromedaries have 1 hump)

**Solving the system:**

From equation 1: d = 180 - c

Substituting into equation 2:
2c + (180 - c) = 304
2c + 180 - c = 304
c = 304 - 180
c = 124

d = 180 - 124

- Kenny keeps: 1/3 of his cards
- Kenny sells: 2/3 of his cards
- After buying the ticket, he has: $50 left for spending

**Step-by-step solution:**

1) **Find total money Kenny made from selling cards:**
   - He needs $100 for the ticket + $50 spending cash
   - Total money from sales = $100 + $50 = $150

2) **Find how many cards Kenny sold:**
   - Each card sells for $1.5
   - Number of cards sold = $150 ÷ $1.5 = 100 cards

3) **Find total cards Kenny started with:**
   - Kenny sold 2/3 of his cards (keeping 1/3)
   - If 2/3 of cards = 100 cards
   - Then 1/3 of cards = 50 cards
   - Total cards = 100 + 50 = 150 cards

**Verification:**
- Started with: 150 cards
- Kept: 1/3 × 150 = 50 cards
- Sold: 2/3 × 150 = 100 cards
- Money earned: 100 × $1.5 = $150
- After buying ticket: $150 - $100 = $50 ✓

**Given information:**
- Expected guests: 36
- Actual guests: 40
- Planning: Most people get 1 hotdog, but enough for half the guests to have 2 hotdogs

**Step 1: Calculate how many hotdogs were prepared**

The caterer prepared enough for half of the 36 expected guests to have a second hotdog.
- Half of 36 guests = 36 ÷ 2 = 18 guests
- So he prepared for 18 guests to have 2 hotdogs each, and 18 guests to have 1 hotdog each
- Total hotdogs prepared = (18 × 2) + (18 × 1) = 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs

Alternatively: 36 guests × 1 hotdog each = 36 hotdogs (first round)
Plus 18 additional hotdogs (for second servings) = 54 total hotdogs

**Step 2: Calculate how many hotdogs were needed**

40 guests showed up and everyone wanted 2 hotdogs.
- Hotdogs needed = 40 × 2 = 80 hotdogs

**Step 3: Calculate the shortage**

- Shortage = 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs short

**Step 4: Determine how many guests didn't get a second hotdog**

- All 40 guests got their first hotdog = 40 hotdogs used
- Remaining hotdogs = 54 - 40 = 14 hotdogs
- Guests who got a second hotdog = 14
- Guests who did NOT get a second hotdog = 40 - 14 = 26 guests

- 1 cheerleader is 60"" tall (the shortest)
- Pyramid structure: 4 on bottom, 3 on next level, 2 on next level, 1 on top
- The shortest girl (60"") is at the top

**Key assumption:**
In a human pyramid, each level stands on the shoulders of the level below. So the height added by each level is approximately the full height of the people in that level.

**Calculating the pyramid height:**

1. **Bottom level (4 girls):** These girls are standing on the ground

From the problem, I know:
1. H + L = $120,000 (total cost)
2. H = 3L (house costs three times as much as the lot)

**Step-by-step solution:**

**Step 1: Identify Herb's house value**
- Herb's house = $76,000

**Step 2: Calculate Juan's house value**
- Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's
- 30% of Herb's house = 0.30 × $76,000 = $22,800

- Current discount: 10% off
- Pete buys 2 boxes

**Step 1: Calculate the discounted price per box**
- Original price: $100.00
- Discount: 10% off = $100.00 × 0.10 = $10.00

**Given information:**
- Each pole has 4 street lights
- Each intersection has 6 poles
- The road has 4 intersections
- 20 street lights are not working

**Step-by-step calculation:**

1. **Street lights per intersection:**
   - Street lights per intersection = poles per intersection × lights per pole
   - Street lights per intersection = 6 × 4 = 24 street lights

2. **Total street lights on the road:**
   - Total street lights = number of intersections × street lights per intersection
   - Total street lights = 4 × 24 = 96 street lights

3. **Functioning street lights:**
   - Functioning street lights = total street lights - non-working street lights
   - Functioning street lights = 96 - 20 = 76 street lights

- Tom's speed - Bob's speed = 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

This means Tom gains 15 miles on Bob every hour.

**Calculation:**

To close a 75-mile gap at a relative speed of 15 mph:

Time = Distance ÷ Speed
Time = 75 miles ÷ 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

**Verification:**

After 5 hours:
- Tom travels: 70 mph × 5 hours = 350 miles
- Bob travels: 55 mph × 5 hours = 275 miles
- Bob's total distance from Tom's starting point: 75 + 275 = 350 miles ✓

Let me work through this step by step:

**Given information:**
- Total cost: $60
- Total classes available: 10
- Maximum acceptable cost per class: $10
- Question: How many classes can he miss?

**Setting up the problem:**
- If Manny misses some classes, he still pays $60 total
- The cost per class attended = $60 ÷ (number of classes attended)
- This cost per class must be ≤ $10 to sign up again

**Finding the minimum classes he must attend:**
- Cost per class = $60 ÷ (classes attended) ≤ $10
- $60 ÷ (classes attended) ≤ $10
- $60 ≤ $10 × (classes attended)
- 6 ≤ classes attended

So Manny must attend at least 6 classes to keep the cost at or below $10 per class.

**Verification:**
- If he attends 6 classes: $60 ÷ 6 = $10 per class ✓ (acceptable)
- If he attends 5 classes: $60 ÷ 5 = $12 per class ✗ (too expensive)

**Answer:**
If he must attend at least 6 classes out of 10 total, then he can miss:
10 - 6 = **4 classes**

gsm8k,gsm8k-660,TrustRoute-NoParallel,1,"I need to find the number of sheep on Lee's farm.

Let me define variables:
- Let s = number of sheep
- Let g = number of geese

Now I'll set up equations based on the given information:

**Heads (animals):**
- Each sheep has 1 head
- Each goose has 1 head
- Total heads = 20

So: s + g = 20

**Legs:**
- Each sheep has 4 legs
- Each goose has 2 legs
- Total legs = 70

So: 4s + 2g = 70

Now I'll solve this system of equations:

From the first equation:
g = 20 - s

Substitute into the second equation:
4s + 2(20 - s) = 70
4s + 40 - 2s = 70
2s + 40 = 70
2s = 30
s = 15

- Sheep: 15
- Geese: 20 - 15 = 5
- Total heads: 15 + 5 = 20 ✓
- Total legs: 15(4) + 5(2) = 60 + 10 = 70 ✓

**Given information:**
1. There is one set of twins (2 people, same age)
2. There is one set of triplets (3 people, same age)
3. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet: w = t + 7
4. Combined ages of all 5 people = 44

**Setting up the equation:**
- Total age of twins: 2w
- Total age of triplets: 3t
- Combined: 2w + 3t = 44

**Solving:**

Let me think through this step by step:

**Understanding the deal:**
- Buy 2 scoops, get 1 free
- This means for every 2 scoops purchased, Erin gets 3 scoops total
- Each scoop costs $1.50

**Calculating the cost:**
- 2 scoops cost: 2 × $1.50 = $3.00
- For $3.00, she gets 3 scoops total (2 purchased + 1 free)

**With $6.00:**
- $6.00 ÷ $3.00 = 2 sets of the deal
- 2 sets × 2 scoops purchased per set = 4 scoops purchased
- 2 sets × 3 scoops received per set = 6 scoops total

**Answer:**
Erin should **buy 4 scoops** of ice cream (which will cost her exactly $6.00), and she will receive **6 scoops total** (the 4 she buys plus 2 free scoops).",0.0049499999999999,7.281383991241455,0,0,cand-claude-sonnet-4-5,stage1_only,,0

Let me break this down step by step:

**Step 1: Identify the original planned price**
- Planned price per computer = $700

**Step 2: Calculate the price increase**
- Price increase = 10% of $700
- Price increase = 0.10 × $700 = $70

**Step 3: Calculate the new price per computer**
- New price = Original price + Price increase
- New price = $700 + $70 = $770

**Step 4: Calculate the total amount paid for 500 computers**
- Total amount = Number of computers × New price per computer
- Total amount = 500 × $770 = $385,000

**Answer: The company paid $385,000 to buy the 500 computers at the new prices.**

Let me define variables for each house:
- Let x = cases needed for the second house
- First house = (1/2)x (half of the second)
- Third house = 2 × (first house) = 2 × (1/2)x = x

Now I'll set up an equation using the total:
First house + Second house + Third house = 250

Substituting:
(1/2)x + x + x = 250

Combining like terms:
(1/2)x + 2x = 250
(5/2)x = 250

Solving for x:
x = 250 × (2/5)
x = 500/5
x = 100

So:
- Second house needs: 100 cases
- First house needs: (1/2) × 100 = 50 cases

**Let me denote:**
- Let z = ounces of citrus zest
- Let f = ounces of fragrance
- Let s = ounces of salt
- Let su = ounces of sugar
- Let o = ounces of oil

**Given relationships:**
1. Citrus zest = fragrance: z = f
2. Salt = sugar: s = su
3. Oil = 2 × salt: o = 2s
4. Salt = 2 × zest: s = 2z
5. Total = 10 ounces: z + f + s + su + o = 10

**Now I'll express everything in terms of z:**

From relationship 1: f = z

From relationship 4: s = 2z

From relationship 2: su = s = 2z

From relationship 3: o = 2s = 2(2z) = 4z

**Substituting into the total:**

2. **Becca has 12 more than Smendrick**: B = S + 12
3. **Smendrick has 3 times what PJ has**: S = 3P

- 3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed
- Total of 18 hours to cross the highway
- Need to find: time for 4 turtles at half the kangaroo speed

**Step 1: Understand what ""total of 18 hours"" means**

The key question is: does ""total of 18 hours"" mean:
- Each kangaroo takes 18 hours? OR
- The combined time is 18 hours (meaning each takes 18/3 = 6 hours)?

The most natural interpretation of ""a total of 18 hours"" when multiple entities are traveling the same distance is that **each one takes 18 hours**. The number of kangaroos doesn't affect the time if they're all traveling independently at the same speed.

**Step 2: Determine the time for one kangaroo**
- Time for 1 kangaroo = 18 hours

**Step 4: Calculate time for one turtle**
Since time is inversely proportional to speed:
- If speed is halved, time is doubled
- Time for 1 turtle = 18 hours × 2 = 36 hours

**Step 5: Determine time for four turtles**
Just like with the kangaroos, if the 4 turtles are each traveling independently across the same highway at the same speed, they each take the same amount of time.

**Answer: 36 hours**

Each of the four turtles will take 36 hours to cross the highway (the number of turtles doesn't change the individual crossing time, just as the number of kangaroos didn't change their individual crossing time).",0.0067829999999999,9.82977294921875,0,0,cand-claude-sonnet-4-5,stage1_only,,0

Let me define variables:
- Let F = number of books Fawn has
- Let A = number of books Anne has
- Let S = number of books Sofie has

Now I'll translate the given information into equations:

1. **Total books**: S + A + F = 85

2. **Sofie has 25 more books than Anne**: S = A + 25

3. **Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn**: A = F - 12

Now I'll substitute to solve for F:

From equation 3: A = F - 12

Substituting into equation 2:
S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13

Now substituting both expressions into equation 1:
(F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85

- Joe paid Tasha $6 for mowing his lawn
- Week 1: Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times as many times as Joe's
- Week 2: Tasha mowed Alba's lawn 5 times as many times as Joe's

**Step 1: Determine how many times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn**

The problem states ""Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work,"" which means she mowed Joe's lawn and earned $6 from him.

Let's assume she mowed Joe's lawn once (this is the most reasonable interpretation).

**Step 2: Calculate earnings from Kamala**

If Tasha mowed Joe's lawn 1 time for $6, then she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times.
- Earnings from Kamala = 3 × $6 = $18

**Step 3: Calculate earnings from Alba**

She mowed Alba's lawn 5 times as many times as Joe's (1 time).
- Earnings from Alba = 5 × $6 = $30

**Step 4: Calculate total lawn mowing earnings**

Total from mowing lawns = Joe + Kamala + Alba
Total from mowing lawns = $6 + $18 + $30 = $54

2. Paul is 10 years older than John
3. Peter's age equals the sum of Paul and John's ages

**Note:** I'll assume ""Jean"" and ""John"" refer to the same person (likely a typo in the problem).

**Setting up equations:**

Let:
- Peter's age = P
- Paul's age = Pa
- John's age = J

From the given information:
1. P + Pa + J = 100
2. Pa = J + 10
3. P = Pa + J

**Solving:**

From equation 3: P = Pa + J

Substitute this into equation 1:
(Pa + J) + Pa + J = 100
2Pa + 2J = 100
Pa + J = 50

But we know from equation 3 that P = Pa + J

Therefore: **P = 50**

**Verification:**

If P = 50, then Pa + J = 50

From equation 2: Pa = J + 10

Substituting:
(J + 10) + J = 50
2J + 10 = 50
2J = 40
J = 20

Therefore: Pa = 20 + 10 = 30

- Let D = Dinar's points

**Setting up equations from the given information:**

1. Total points: B + A + D = 45

2. Bahati scored the most and it was 20 more than Azibo: B = A + 20

3. Bahati scored 10 more than Dinar: B = D + 10

**Solving the system:**

From equation 2: B = A + 20
From equation 3: B = D + 10

Since both equal B, I can find the relationship between D and A:
- A + 20 = D + 10
- D = A + 10

Now I'll substitute into equation 1:
- B + A + D = 45

**Given information:**
- The book is 1.5 inches thick
- When stacked, the paper is 100 pages to the inch
- Each sheet of paper is printed on both sides
- One page is printed on each side

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. First, let me clarify the terminology:
   - A ""sheet"" or ""leaf"" of paper has two sides
   - Each side can have one ""page"" printed on it
   - So 1 sheet of paper = 2 pages

2. The problem states ""100 pages to the inch"" - this is the key measurement.

   - Thickness = 1.5 inches
   - Pages per inch = 100
   - Total pages = 1.5 × 100 = **150 pages**

**Answer: 150 pages**

Note: The statement ""100 pages to the inch"" already accounts for the fact that paper is printed on both sides.

Let me break down the problem step by step:

**Given information:**
- Supplies cost: $400 (total)
- Tickets cost: 50% more than the supplies

**Step 1: Understand what ""50% more"" means**
If tickets cost 50% more than supplies, that means:
- Tickets cost = Supplies cost + 50% of supplies cost
- Tickets cost = Supplies cost × (1 + 0.50)
- Tickets cost = Supplies cost × 1.5

**Step 2: Calculate the ticket cost**
- Tickets cost = $400 × 1.5
- Tickets cost = $600

gsm8k,gsm8k-963,TrustRoute-NoParallel,1,"I need to find how many Pokemon Stan has caught.

Let me define variables:
- Let A = number of Pokemon Alex caught
- Let S = number of Pokemon Stan caught  
- Let W = number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught

Now I'll translate the problem into equations:

**Given information:**
1. Together they have caught 339 Pokemon: A + S + W = 339
2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan: A = S + 5
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe: S = 4W - 13

**Solving the system:**

From equation 2: A = S + 5
From equation 3: S = 4W - 13, which means W = (S + 13)/4

Substituting into equation 1:
(S + 5) + S + W = 339

Now substitute W = (S + 13)/4:
(S + 5) + S + (S + 13)/4 = 339

Multiply everything by 4 to clear the fraction:
4(S + 5) + 4S + (S + 13) = 1356
4S + 20 + 4S + S + 13 = 1356
9S + 33 = 1356
9S = 1323
S = 147

**Verification:**
- Stan caught: S = 147
- Adelwolfe caught: W = (147 + 13)/4 = 160/4 = 40
- Alex caught: A = 147 + 5 = 152
- Total: 152 + 147 + 40 = 339 ✓
- Stan = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 ✓

- The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland
- These 44 trips are only half the number of trips the first plane makes

So if 44 = (1/2) × (first plane's trips), then:

- Cost per student per session: $1.50
- Number of students: 10
- Sessions per week: 3 days
- Time period: 1 month

**Step 1: Calculate revenue per session**

**Step 2: Calculate cost per session**
- Cost per session = $25 (studio rental)

- Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity
- Wanda Day 1 = 1/4 × 18,000 = 4,500 gallons

*Ms. B's contribution:*
- Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much as Wanda
- Ms. B Day 1 = 3/4 × 4,500 = 3,375 gallons

Let me denote the initial charge as x%.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **First phase (5 hours):** The power bank loses 9% of total capacity each hour
   - After 5 hours: x - 5(9) = x - 45%

2. **Second phase (3 hours):** The power bank loses 7% of total capacity each hour
   - After 3 more hours: (x - 45) - 3(7) = x - 45 - 21 = x - 66%

3. **Final charge:** 28%
   - So: x - 66 = 28

4. **Solving for x:**
   - x = 28 + 66
   - x = 94%

**Verification:**
- Starting charge: 94%
- After 5 hours at 9%/hour loss: 94% - 45% = 49%

**Given information:**
- Initial price: $120
- Annual increase: 5% of the original price
- Time period: 3 years

**Step-by-step solution:**

Let me clarify the problem first. The phrase ""5% of the original price every year"" means each year the price increases by 5% of $120 (not compound interest).

**Year 0 (Initial):** $120

**Year 1:** 
- Increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 × $120 = $6
- New price = $120 + $6 = $126

**Year 2:**
- Increase = 5% of $120 = $6
- New price = $126 + $6 = $132

**Year 3:**
- Increase = 5% of $120 = $6
- New price = $132 + $6 = $138

**Alternative formula:**
Price after n years = Original price + (n × 5% × Original price)
Price after 3 years = $120 + (3 × 0.05 × $120)
Price after 3 years = $120 + (3 × $6)
Price after 3 years = $120 + $18
Price after 3 years = $138

**Answer: $138**

Note: If the problem intended compound interest (5% of the current price each year), the calculation would be:
- Price = $120 × (1.05)³ = $120 × 1.157625 = $138.915 ≈ $139

But based on the wording ""5% of the original price,"" the answer is **$138**.",0.006735,7.599554777145386,0,0,cand-claude-sonnet-4-5,stage1_only,,1

- Package 2: 4 sandwiches for $6
- Package 3: 8 sandwiches for $? (unknown)
- Prices are proportional

**Step 1: Verify that the given prices are proportional**

Now I'll set up an equation using the total:

First set + Second set + Third set = 19

(s + 4) + s + (s/2) = 19

gsm8k,gsm8k-1048,TrustRoute-NoParallel,1,"I need to find the price of the car in 2010 after it depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year from 2007.

## Step-by-step Solution

**Given information:**
- Initial price (2007): $20,000
- Depreciation rate: 21% per year
- Time period: 2007 to 2010

**Step 1: Determine the number of years**
From 2007 to 2010 = 3 years

**Step 2: Apply the depreciation formula**
When something depreciates at a constant rate, we use the exponential decay formula:

Price = Initial Price × (1 - depreciation rate)^number of years

**Step 3: Calculate**
- Depreciation rate = 21% = 0.21
- Remaining value each year = 1 - 0.21 = 0.79 (or 79%)

Price in 2010 = $20,000 × (0.79)³

Let me calculate this:
- (0.79)³ = 0.79 × 0.79 × 0.79
- 0.79 × 0.79 = 0.6241
- 0.6241 × 0.79 = 0.493039

Price in 2010 = $20,000 × 0.493039 = $9,860.78

**Answer: The price of the car in 2010 is $9,860.78**

Alternatively, we can verify year by year:

Let me break this down step by step:

**Step 1: Determine how much butter Dennis needs**
- 1 pound of butter per dozen croissants
- He needs 6 dozen croissants
- Therefore, he needs 6 pounds of butter

**Step 2: Understand the promotion**
- Buy one pound at full price ($4.00)
- Get one pound at half off ($2.00)
- This pattern repeats for pairs of pounds

**Step 3: Calculate the cost for 6 pounds**
Since the promotion works in pairs (buy 1, get 1 half off), I'll group the 6 pounds into 3 pairs:

- Pair 1: $4.00 (full price) + $2.00 (half off) = $6.00
- Pair 2: $4.00 (full price) + $2.00 (half off) = $6.00
- Pair 3: $4.00 (full price) + $2.00 (half off) = $6.00

**Total cost: $6.00 × 3 = $18.00**

Alternatively, I can calculate it as:
- 3 pounds at full price: 3 × $4.00 = $12.00
- 3 pounds at half price: 3 × $2.00 = $6.00

## Given Information:
- **MTB price**: $500
- **BMX price**: half of MTB = $500 / 2 = $250
- **Trekking price**: $450
- **Total bikes sold**: 300
- **Trekking bikes**: 50% of total
- **BMX bikes**: 15% of total
- **MTB bikes**: the rest

## Step-by-Step Solution:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of each bike type sold**

- Trekking bikes: 50% of 300 = 0.5 × 300 = **150 bikes**
- BMX bikes: 15% of 300 = 0.15 × 300 = **45 bikes**
- MTB bikes: 300 - 150 - 45 = **105 bikes**

**Step 2: Calculate earnings from each bike type**

- 240 boys represent 40% of the school population

**Step 1: Find the total school population**

If 40% of the school = 240 boys, then:
- 0.40 × Total population = 240
- Total population = 240 ÷ 0.40
- Total population = 600 students

**Step 2: Find the number of girls**

If boys make up 40% of the school, then girls make up:
- 100% - 40% = 60% of the school

Number of girls:
- 60% of 600 = 0.60 × 600
- Number of girls = 360

**Alternative calculation:**
- Total students - Boys = Girls
- 600 - 240 = 360

- Mug 1: 33 degrees
- Mug 2: unknown temperature (let's call it T)
- He pours 4 ounces from Mug 1 and 1 ounce from Mug 2
- The resulting mixture is drinkable (at least 40 degrees)

**Solution:**

When liquids of different temperatures are mixed, the final temperature is the weighted average based on the volumes:

Final temperature = (Volume₁ × Temp₁ + Volume₂ × Temp₂) / (Volume₁ + Volume₂)

Setting up the equation:
- Volume₁ = 4 ounces at 33 degrees
- Volume₂ = 1 ounce at T degrees
- Final temperature ≥ 40 degrees

For the minimum temperature of the second bottle, the mixture should be exactly 40 degrees:

(4 × 33 + 1 × T) / (4 + 1) = 40

(132 + T) / 5 = 40

132 + T = 200

- Colin's age in 7 years = C + 7
- Wendy's current age = 5(C + 7)
- Equation 1: W = 5(C + 7)

**Statement 2:** ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now""

- Bernie has 4 dogs
- Dog 1 needs: 1 mile
- Dog 2 needs: 4 miles
- Dog 3 needs: 3 miles
- Dog 4 needs: ? miles
- Average for all dogs: 3 miles per day

**Step-by-step solution:**

The average is calculated as: (sum of all values) / (number of values)

So: Average = (Dog 1 + Dog 2 + Dog 3 + Dog 4) / 4

Substituting the known values:
3 = (1 + 4 + 3 + Dog 4) / 4

3 = (8 + Dog 4) / 4

Multiply both sides by 4:
12 = 8 + Dog 4

Subtract 8 from both sides:
Dog 4 = 12 - 8 = 4

Let me work through this step by step:

**Step 1: Find the cost price per watermelon**
- Total cost = $80
- Number of watermelons = 50
- Cost per watermelon = $80 ÷ 50 = $1.60

**Step 2: Calculate the total selling price with 25% profit**
- Profit = 25% of $80
- Profit = 0.25 × $80 = $20
- Total selling price = Cost price + Profit
- Total selling price = $80 + $20 = $100

**Step 3: Find the selling price per watermelon**
- Selling price per watermelon = $100 ÷ 50 = $2.00

**Answer: Each watermelon was sold for $2.00**

To verify: 
- Cost per watermelon: $1.60
- Selling per watermelon: $2.00
- Profit per watermelon: $2.00 - $1.60 = $0.40

gsm8k,gsm8k-1317,TrustRoute-NoParallel,1,"I need to find how many chickens and cows Farmer Brown has.

Let me set up the problem step by step:

**Define variables:**
- Let c = number of chickens
- Let w = number of cows

**Set up equations based on the given information:**
1. Total animals: c + w = 20
2. Total legs: 2c + 4w = 70 (chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4 legs)

**Solve the system of equations:**

From equation 1:
c = 20 - w

Substitute into equation 2:
2(20 - w) + 4w = 70
40 - 2w + 4w = 70
40 + 2w = 70
2w = 30
w = 15

Now find c:
c = 20 - w
c = 20 - 15
c = 5

**Verify the answer:**
- Total animals: 5 + 15 = 20 ✓
- Total legs: 5(2) + 15(4) = 10 + 60 = 70 ✓
