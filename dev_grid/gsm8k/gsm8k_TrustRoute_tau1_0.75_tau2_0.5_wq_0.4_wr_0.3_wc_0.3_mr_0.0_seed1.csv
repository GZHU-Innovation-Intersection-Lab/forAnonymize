1. **Calculate the total investment**: This includes the purchase price of the house and the cost of repairs.
   \[
   \text{Total Investment} = \text{Purchase Price} + \text{Repair Costs} = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000
   \]

2. **Determine the increased value of the house**: The value of the house increased by 150%. To find the new value, we first calculate 150% of the original purchase price.
   \[
   \text{Increase in Value} = 150\% \times \text{Purchase Price} = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000
   \]
   Now, add this increase to the original purchase price to find the new value of the house.
   \[
   \text{New Value of the House} = \text{Purchase Price} + \text{Increase in Value} = 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the profit**: Profit is determined by subtracting the total investment from the new value of the house.
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{New Value of the House} - \text{Total Investment} = 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000

gsm8k,gsm8k-7,TrustRoute,1,"It looks like there might be a typo in your question—""How load does it take"" probably means ""How long does it take."" I'll assume that's the case and provide a step-by-step explanation for the total time required to download the 200 GB file.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Calculate the time for the initial download until the interruption:**
   - The file is 200 GB, and Carla downloads at 2 GB/minute.
   - The interruption occurs at 40% of the way through, which is 40% of 200 GB = 0.40 × 200 GB = 80 GB.
   - Time to download 80 GB at 2 GB/minute = 80 GB ÷ 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.

2. **Account for the restart:**
   - The Windows restart takes 20 minutes.
   - After the restart, Carla has to start the download from the beginning, meaning she loses the progress (80 GB) and begins anew.

3. **Calculate the time for the full download on the second attempt:**
   - Assuming no further interruptions after the restart, she now downloads the entire 200 GB.
   - Time to download 200 GB at 2 GB/minute = 200 GB ÷ 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes.

4. **Add up the total time:**
   - Time for the first partial download: 40 minutes
   - Time for the restart: 20 minutes
   - Time for the full second download: 100 minutes
   - Total time = 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 100 minutes = 160 minutes

### Final Answer:
It takes **160 minutes** for Carla to complete the download of the 200 GB file, assuming the interruption only occurs once during the first attempt. 

If the interruption were to happen repeatedly (e.g., every time she reaches 40%), the process would loop indefinitely, and she might never finish. However, based on the details provided, I've assumed it's a one-time event.

gsm8k,gsm8k-30,TrustRoute,1,"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1.  **Understand the Ratio:** The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11. This means for every 7 parts of Darrell's age, there are 11 parts of Allen's age.

2.  **Total Ratio Parts:** Add the parts of the ratio: 7 + 11 = 18 parts.

3.  **Value of One Part:** The total age is 162, and this represents 18 parts. So, divide the total age by the total ratio parts to find the value of one part:
    162 / 18 = 9

4.  **Calculate Current Ages:**
    *   Darrell's current age = 7 parts * 9 years/part = 63 years
    *   Allen's current age = 11 parts * 9 years/part = 99 years

5.  **Verify Total Age:** 63 + 99 = 162. This matches the given information.

6.  **Calculate Allen's Age 10 Years from Now:**
    Allen's current age + 10 years = 99 + 10 = 109 years.

We are given two pieces of information:
1.  Gretchen has 110 coins in total:
    G + S = 110

2.  There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins:
    G = S + 30

Now we can use the second equation and substitute it into the first equation:
(S + 30) + S = 110
2S + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:
2S = 110 - 30
2S = 80

Divide by 2:
S = 80 / 2
S = 40

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins.

Now, use the value of S to find G using the second equation (G = S + 30):
G = 40 + 30
G = 70

Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

To verify:
Gold coins (G) + Silver coins (S) = 70 + 40 = 110 (Total coins match)
Gold coins (G) is 30 more than Silver coins (S): 70 = 40 + 30 (Difference matches)

2.  **Find Dana's running speed:**
    We know she can skip at a rate that is half as fast as she can run. This means her running speed is double her skipping speed.

1) First, I'll find how much weight capacity is available for boxes:
   - Available capacity = Bridge limit - (Driver + Empty truck)
   - Available capacity = 5000 - 3755
   - Available capacity = 1245 pounds

2) Now I'll find the maximum number of boxes:
   - Number of boxes = Available capacity ÷ Weight per box
   - Number of boxes = 1245 ÷ 15
   - Number of boxes = 83

3) Let me verify this answer:
   - Total weight = 3755 + (83 × 15)
   - Total weight = 3755 + 1245
   - Total weight = 5000 pounds ✓

**Answer: The maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 83 boxes.**",0.005105400000000001,14.197488784790039,0,0,cand-claude-sonnet-4-5,stage2_vote,

- We start with a total of 24 liters of water.
- Two girls each receive 1/6 of the 24 liters.
- Then, a boy takes 6 liters.
- We need to find out how much water is left after these distributions.

### Step 2: Calculate how much water the girls received
- First, find 1/6 of 24 liters:
  \[
  \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters}
  \]
- Each girl gets 4 liters, and there are two girls, so:

### Step 1: Understand the information
- The alarm rang three times in total.
- First time: It rang 4 times.
- Second time: It rang for three times as long as the first time. Since the first time it rang 4 times, the second time it rang 3 × 4 = 12 times.
- Third time: It rang for half as long as the second time. Since the second time it rang 12 times, the third time it rang 12 × 0.5 = 6 times.

gsm8k,gsm8k-87,TrustRoute,1,"To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, let's break this down step by step based on the information provided.

### Step 1: Understand the initial salary
- Sylvie's current monthly salary is $600.
- Her annual salary is therefore:  
  \( 600 \times 12 = 7200 \) dollars per year.

### Step 2: Understand the salary increase policy
- The company increases the salary by 10% of the initial salary every year for employees who have stayed 5 years.
- The initial salary is the original monthly salary of $600.
- 10% of the initial monthly salary is:  
  \( 0.10 \times 600 = 60 \) dollars per month.
- This means that every year after completing 5 years, Sylvie's monthly salary increases by a fixed amount of $60.

### Step 3: Calculate the salary after three more years
- Sylvie has just completed 5 years, so the increases will apply for each of the next three years.
- Starting monthly salary: $600.
- After the first year (end of year 6):  
  \( 600 + 60 = 660 \) dollars per month.
- After the second year (end of year 7):  
  \( 660 + 60 = 720 \) dollars per month.
- After the third year (end of year 8):  
  \( 720 + 60 = 780 \) dollars per month.

### Step 4: Calculate the annual salary after three years
- After three more years, her monthly salary is $780.
- Her annual salary is:  
  \( 780 \times 12 = 9360 \) dollars per year.

### Final Answer
Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service will be **$9,360**.",0.0031953499999999996,33.494630575180054,0,0,cand-grok-3-mini,stage2_confidence,

   \[
   \text{Number of cats} = 2 \times \text{Number of dogs} = 2 \times 60 = 120
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of dogs and cats**: Now, we can find the total number of dogs and cats combined:

2. **Calculate the volume of canned tomatoes used**: Since Freda made 32 ounces of sauce, and this is half the volume of the canned tomatoes, we can calculate the volume of canned tomatoes used:
   \[
   \text{Volume of canned tomatoes} = 2 \times \text{Volume of sauce} = 2 \times 32 \text{ ounces} = 64 \text{ ounces}

gsm8k,gsm8k-115,TrustRoute,1,"To calculate Sasha's profit from selling her leftover lumber, we first need to determine the total cost of the lumber she initially purchased and the total revenue she would earn from selling it at the new price after the price increase.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the lumber:**
   - For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
     - Cost per board = $10
     - Number of boards = 10
     - Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = \(10 \times 10 = 100\) dollars

   - For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
     - Cost per board = $16
     - Number of boards = 5
     - Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = \(5 \times 16 = 80\) dollars

   - Total cost of all lumber = Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards + Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 100 + 80 = 180 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the new selling price after the 50% increase:**
   - For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
     - New selling price per board = \(10 + (0.50 \times 10) = 10 + 5 = 15\) dollars
     - Total revenue from selling 2 x 4 x 10 boards = \(10 \times 15 = 150\) dollars

   - For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
     - New selling price per board = \(16 + (0.50 \times 16) = 16 + 8 = 24\) dollars
     - Total revenue from selling 4 x 4 x 10 boards = \(5 \times 24 = 120\) dollars

   - Total revenue from selling all lumber = Total revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 boards + Total revenue from 4 x 4 x 10 boards
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 150 + 120 = 270 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost

**Step 1: Understand the ratio**
- Sugar : Water = 7 : 13
- This means for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, there are 13 cups of water

**Step 2: Set up the equation**
- Let the common multiplier be x
- Teaspoons of sugar = 7x
- Cups of water = 13x
- Total = 7x + 13x = 120

**Step 3: Solve for x**

gsm8k,gsm8k-119,TrustRoute,1,"To calculate the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later, let's break this down step by step based on the information provided.

### Step 1: Determine Lylah's salary four years ago
- Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
- Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's salary at that time.
- Let \( L_0 \) be Lylah's salary four years ago.
- Then, Adrien's salary = \( L_0 + 0.30 \times L_0 = 1.30 \times L_0 \).
- So, \( 40,000 = 1.30 \times L_0 \).
- Solving for \( L_0 \):
  \[
  L_0 = \frac{40,000}{1.30} = \frac{40,000}{1.3} = 30,769.23
  \]
- Therefore, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.

### Step 2: Determine Adrien's salary four years later
- Adrien's salary increased by 40% from four years ago.
- Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
- New salary for Adrien = \( 40,000 + 0.40 \times 40,000 = 1.40 \times 40,000 = 56,000 \).
- So, Adrien's salary four years later is $56,000.

### Step 3: Determine Lylah's salary four years later
- The prompt states that both salaries increased simultaneously, but it does not specify the exact increase rate for Lylah.
- Based on the context, a reasonable assumption is that Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's (40%), as this is a common interpretation in such problems when no other information is provided.
- Lylah's salary four years ago was $30,769.23.
- New salary for Lylah = \( 30,769.23 + 0.40 \times 30,769.23 = 1.40 \times 30,769.23 \).
- Calculating:
  \[
  1.40 \times 30,769.23 = 43,076.92
  \]
- So, Lylah's salary four years later is approximately $43,076.92.

### Step 4: Calculate the total salary four years later
- Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary.
- Total = $56,000 + $43,076.92 = $99,076.92.

### Final Answer
The total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later is approximately **$99,077** (rounded to the nearest dollar, as salaries are typically expressed in whole numbers). 

**Note:** This calculation assumes Lylah's salary increased by 40%, as implied by the simultaneous increase and lack of additional details. If the increase rate for Lylah differs, the result would need to be adjusted accordingly.",0.01069385,41.872148752212524,0,0,cand-grok-3-mini,stage2_vote,

gsm8k,gsm8k-143,TrustRoute,1,"Thank you for your query. I'll break this down step by step to calculate the total cost of John's purchases, taking into account the 10% tax on non-food items.

### Step 1: Identify the items and categorize them
- **Food items** (no tax): Milk and Eggs. These are typically considered food.
- **Non-food items** (10% tax applies): Light bulbs, Cups, and Roach traps.

The prices are:
- Milk: $2 (food)
- Eggs: $3 (food)
- Light bulbs: $3 (non-food)
- Cups: $3 (non-food)
- Roach traps: $4 (non-food)

### Step 2: Calculate the subtotal for food items
Food items are not taxed, so we just add their costs:
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
- **Subtotal for food items**: $2 + $3 = $5

### Step 3: Calculate the subtotal for non-food items and apply tax
First, add the costs of non-food items:
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4
- **Subtotal for non-food items**: $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

Now, apply a 10% tax on this subtotal:
- Tax amount: 10% of $10 = 0.10 × $10 = $1
- **Total for non-food items (including tax)**: $10 + $1 = $11

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost
Add the subtotal for food items and the total for non-food items:
- Subtotal for food items: $5
- Total for non-food items (with tax): $11
- **Grand total**: $5 + $11 = $16

So, the total cost for everything is **$16**. If you have any additional details or questions, feel free to ask!",0.0053032999999999995,15.334808349609375,0,0,cand-grok-3-mini,stage2_vote,

**Step 2:** Seagull ate half of what Dave ate = 14/2 = 7 fries
- Remaining: X - 14 - 7 = X - 21

**Step 3:** Three pigeons each ate 3 fries = 3 × 3 = 9 fries
- Remaining: X - 21 - 9 = X - 30

**Step 4:** Raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries
- If the raccoon took 2/3, then 1/3 remained
- Remaining: (X - 30) × 1/3 = (X - 30)/3

**Step 5:** Ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 5 behind
- Before ants: 5 + 1 = 6 fries

### Step 1: Calculate hours per week
- **Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays**: Kimo has three 1-hour classes each day.  
  - Hours per day: 3 classes × 1 hour/class = 3 hours  
  - There are 3 such days per week: 3 days × 3 hours/day = 9 hours  

- **Tuesdays and Thursdays**: Kimo has two 2-hour classes each day.

### Step 1: Calculate the total length of the rolls
- Each roll is 4 inches long.
- There are 300 rolls.
- Total length of rolls: 300 × 4 inches = 1,200 inches.
- Convert to feet: 1,200 inches ÷ 12 = 100 feet.

### Step 2: Calculate the total length of the chocolate croissants
- Each croissant is 6 inches long.
- There are 120 croissants.
- Total length of croissants: 120 × 6 inches = 720 inches.
- Convert to feet: 720 inches ÷ 12 = 60 feet.

- Each baguette is 2 feet long (already in feet).
- There are 60 baguettes.
- Total length of baguettes: 60 × 2 feet = 120 feet.

### Step 4: Add up all the lengths
- Total length = Length of rolls + Length of croissants + Length of baguettes

**Team B (Less well-rounded team):**

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**
   The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes.

   The total number of outcomes when rolling a die is 6.

   \[
   P(\text{greater than 3}) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}

   To express this as a percentage:

2. **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**
   The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 even numbers.

   The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:
   \[
   P(\text{even on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]

   The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is the same:
   \[
   P(\text{even on second roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]

   Since the rolls are independent, the probability of both events happening (rolling two even numbers in a row) is:
   \[
   P(\text{two even numbers}) = P(\text{even on first roll}) \times P(\text{even on second roll}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}

   To express this as a percentage:
   \[
   P(\text{two even numbers}) = \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\%

3. **Finding how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers:**

     50(1) + 18r = 140 \implies 50 + 18r = 140 \implies 18r = 90 \implies r = 5
     \]
   - If \( h = 2 \):
     \[
     50(2) + 18r = 140 \implies 100 + 18r = 140 \implies 18r = 40 \implies r \approx 2.22 \quad (\text{not an integer})

gsm8k,gsm8k-187,TrustRoute,1,"To calculate how much Mandy should pay Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can use the formula for compound interest:

\[ A = P(1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n months, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (as a decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of months the money is borrowed.

In this case:
- \( P = 100 \) (the amount owed)
- \( r = 0.02 \) (2% interest rate)
- \( n = 3 \) (the number of months)

Now, we can plug in the values:

\[ A = 100(1 + 0.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100(1.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 \times 1.061208 \]
\[ A \approx 106.12 \]

gsm8k,gsm8k-188,TrustRoute,1,"Let's denote the number of bags the trader bought as \( x \).

1. **Cost of buying the bags**:
   The cost to buy the bags from the farmer is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of bags} = 20x
   \]

2. **Cost of transportation**:
   The cost to transport each bag is $2, so the total transportation cost is:
   \[
   \text{Transportation cost} = 2x
   \]

3. **Total cost**:
   The total cost incurred by the trader is the sum of the cost of the bags and the transportation cost:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 20x + 2x = 22x
   \]

4. **Revenue from selling the bags**:
   The trader sells each bag for $30, so the total revenue from selling all the bags is:
   \[
   \text{Revenue} = 30x
   \]

5. **Profit calculation**:
   The profit made by the trader is given by the revenue minus the total cost:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 30x - 22x = 8x

6. **Setting up the equation**:
   According to the problem, the trader made a total profit of $400:
   \[
   8x = 400

7. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   To find the number of bags sold, we solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{400}{8} = 50

2. **Cost of food**: They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. 
   \[
   \text{Cost of food} = \text{Cost of tickets} - 4.50 = 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75
