humaneval,HumanEval/163,MV-3,1,"The problem asks us to find all *even digits* that fall within the range defined by two positive integers `a` and `b`. The result should be in ascending order.

Let's break down the requirements:
1.  **Positive integers `a` and `b`**: This means `a >= 1` and `b >= 1`.
2.  **Even digits**: ""Digits"" refer to the single-digit numbers from 0 to 9. The even digits are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8.
3.  **Between `a` and `b` (inclusive)**: We need to consider the range from `min(a, b)` to `max(a, b)`.
4.  **Ascending order**: The output list must be sorted.

Considering these points:
*   Since `a` and `b` are positive, `min(a, b)` will always be at least 1. This means the digit `0` can never be within the range `[min(a, b), max(a, b)]`. So, we only need to consider the positive even digits: 2, 4, 6, 8.
*   The numbers `a` and `b` themselves can be larger than single digits (e.g., `10`, `14`). However, the result should only contain ""digits"". This implies that numbers like `10`, `12`, `14` are not considered ""digits"" in the context of the output list. The example `generate_integers(10, 14) => []` confirms this interpretation.

**Algorithm:**
1.  Determine the actual lower and upper bounds of the range by finding `start = min(a, b)` and `end = max(a, b)`.
2.  Initialize an empty list called `result`.
3.  Iterate through the possible positive even digits: 2, 4, 6, 8.
4.  For each `digit` in this set, check if it is within the determined range (`start <= digit <= end`).
5.  If the digit is within the range, add it to the `result` list.
6.  Since we iterate through the potential digits in ascending order (2, then 4, then 6, then 8), the `result` list will naturally be in ascending order.
7.  Return the `result` list.

**Example Walkthrough: `generate_integers(2, 8)`**
1.  `start = min(2, 8) = 2`, `end = max(2, 8) = 8`.
2.  `result = []`.
3.  Potential even digits to check: `[2, 4, 6, 8]`.
    *   For `digit = 2`: Is `2 <= 2 <= 8`? Yes. Add `2` to `result`. `result = [2]`.
    *   For `digit = 4`: Is `2 <= 4 <= 8`? Yes. Add `4` to `result`. `result = [2, 4]`.
    *   For `digit = 6`: Is `2 <= 6 <= 8`? Yes. Add `6` to `result`. `result = [2, 4, 6]`.
    *   For `digit = 8`: Is `2 <= 8 <= 8`? Yes. Add `8` to `result`. `result = [2, 4, 6, 8]`.
4.  Return `[2, 4, 6, 8]`.

**Example Walkthrough: `generate_integers(10, 14)`**
1.  `start = min(10, 14) = 10`, `end = max(10, 14) = 14`.
2.  `result = []`.
3.  Potential even digits to check: `[2, 4, 6, 8]`.
    *   For `digit = 2`: Is `10 <= 2 <= 14`? No.
    *   For `digit = 4`: Is `10 <= 4 <= 14`? No.
    *   For `digit = 6`: Is `10 <= 6 <= 14`? No.
    *   For `digit = 8`: Is `10 <= 8 <= 14`? No.
4.  Return `[]`.

humaneval,HumanEval/37,MV-3,1,"To solve this problem, we need to sort the elements at even indices in a given list while keeping the elements at odd indices unchanged. The solution involves extracting the elements at even indices, sorting them, and then merging them back with the elements at odd indices to form the final list.

### Approach
1. **Extract Elements at Even Indices**: Iterate through the original list and collect all elements located at even indices (0, 2, 4, etc.) into a separate list.
2. **Sort the Extracted Elements**: Sort the list of elements collected from even indices in ascending order.
3. **Merge Sorted Elements Back into Original List**: Iterate through the original list again. For each even index, place the next element from the sorted list. For each odd index, retain the original element from the input list.

### Solution Code
```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    even_elements = [l[i] for i in range(len(l)) if i % 2 == 0]
    even_elements.sort()
    result = []
    sorted_index = 0
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            result.append(even_elements[sorted_index])
            sorted_index += 1
        else:
            result.append(l[i])
    return result
```

### Explanation
1. **Extracting Even Elements**: The list comprehension `[l[i] for i in range(len(l)) if i % 2 == 0]` collects all elements from the original list `l` that are located at even indices.
2. **Sorting Even Elements**: The collected elements are sorted in ascending order using the `sort()` method.
3. **Constructing Result List**: We initialize an empty list `result` and a counter `sorted_index` to track the position in the sorted even elements list. For each index in the original list:
   - If the index is even, we append the next element from the sorted list and increment `sorted_index`.
   - If the index is odd, we directly append the corresponding element from the original list.
4. **Return Result**: The constructed `result` list is returned, which contains sorted elements at even indices and original elements at odd indices.

### Example Walkthrough
For `sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4])`:
- **Extract Even Elements**: Elements at indices 0 and 2 are `[5, 3]`.
- **Sort Even Elements**: Sorting `[5, 3]` gives `[3, 5]`.
- **Merge Back**:
  - Index 0 (even): Place `3` (first element from sorted list).
  - Index 1 (odd): Place `",0.02048768,13.774562120437622,0,0,MajorityVoting-k3,,
humaneval,HumanEval/116,MV-3,1,"Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Sort an array based on the number of 1s in binary representation (ascending)
2. For equal number of 1s, sort by decimal value (ascending)
3. Handle the examples given (note: the description says ""non-negative"" but examples show negative numbers)

Let me analyze the examples:
- `[1, 5, 2, 3, 4]`: 
  - 1 = 0b1 (one 1)
  - 2 = 0b10 (one 1)  
  - 3 = 0b11 (two 1s)
  - 4 = 0b100 (one 1)
  - 5 = 0b101 (two 1s)
  - Result: [1, 2, 4, 3, 5] - but expected is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]?

Wait, let me reconsider. Looking at the expected output `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, it seems like when counts are equal, we sort by decimal value. Let me verify:
- 1 (1 bit): 1
- 2 (1 bit): 2  
- 4 (1 bit): 4
- 3 (2 bits): 3
- 5 (2 bits): 5

So sorted: [1, 2, 4] then [3, 5] = [1, 2, 4, 3, 5] ❌

Hmm, the expected output doesn't match. Let me check if there's a different interpretation... Actually, looking more carefully, maybe the sort should be stable or there's a typo. Let me implement what the description says and see:

```python
def sort_array(arr):
    """"""
    In this Kata, you have to sort an array of non-negative integers according to
    number of ones in their binary representation in ascending order.
    For similar number of ones, sort based on decimal value.

    # Sort by: (number of 1s in binary, decimal value)
    return sorted(arr, key=lambda x: (count_ones(x), x))
```

Let me test with the examples:

```python
# Test cases
print(sort_array([1, 5, 2, 3, 4]))  # Expected: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

### Explanation:
- **Step 1:** We use a generator expression with `swapcase()` to swap the case of all letters in the input string.
- **Step 2:** For each character in the swapped string:
  - If it's a letter and a vowel (checked via `char.lower() in 'aeiou'`), we calculate the new letter:
    - Determine its position in the alphabet (0-25).
    - Add 2 to the position and use modulo 26 to handle wrapping (e.g., 'Y' + 2 would wrap to 'A').
    - Create the new character in the same case as the original vowel.
  - If it's not a vowel or not a letter, we leave it unchanged.
- The result is joined back into a string and returned.

### Explanation:
1. **Base Cases**: We handle the first two cases explicitly:

   - `tri(1) = 3`
   
2. **Even Numbers**: For even `n`, we use the formula `tri(n) = 1 + n / 2`.

3. **Odd Numbers**: For odd `n`, we calculate `tri(n)` using the values of the previous two numbers and the next number in the sequence.

4. **List Construction**: We build the list iteratively, ensuring we have all required values before calculating the next one.

5. **Return Value**: Finally, we return the constructed list of Tribonacci numbers.

### Explanation:
1. **convert_to_number function**: This helper function converts a string representation of a number to a float. It replaces commas with dots to handle different decimal formats and attempts to convert the string to a float. If the conversion fails (e.g., the string is not a valid number), it returns the original string.

2. **compare_one function**: This function takes two parameters, converts them using `convert_to_number`, and compares the converted values. If they are equal, it returns `None`. Otherwise, it returns the larger of the two original values.

humaneval,HumanEval/25,MV-3,1,"To implement the `factorize` function, we need to find the prime factors of a given integer `n` and return them in a list, including each factor repeated according to its multiplicity in the factorization.

Here's how we can approach the problem step by step:

1. **Initialize an empty list** to store the prime factors.
2. **Start dividing `n` by the smallest prime (2)** and continue dividing until `n` is no longer divisible by that prime. Each time we divide, we append the prime to the list.
3. **Move to the next potential prime factor** (3, 5, 7, etc.) and repeat the process until we reach the square root of `n`.
4. **If `n` is still greater than 1** after checking all potential factors up to its square root, then `n` itself is a prime factor and should be added to the list.
5. **Return the list of factors**.

- We first handle the factor 2 separately to allow for even numbers.
- We then check for odd factors starting from 3 up to the square root of `n`.

Let me trace through the examples:
- `{""a"":""apple"", ""b"":""banana""}` - all lowercase → True
- `{""a"":""apple"", ""A"":""banana"", ""B"":""banana""}` - mixed lower/upper → False
- `{""a"":""apple"", 8:""banana"", ""a"":""apple""}` - has non-string key (8) → False

Here's the solution:

    '''
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return the area of
    the triangle rounded to 2 decimal points if the three sides form a valid triangle. 
    Otherwise return -1
    Three sides make a valid triangle when the sum of any two sides is greater 
    than the third side.
    Example:
    triangle_area(3, 4, 5) == 6.00
    triangle_area(1, 2, 10) == -1
    '''
    # Check if the sides form a valid triangle

        area = math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))
        # Round to 2 decimal places and return
        return round(area, 2)
    else:
        # Not a valid triangle
        return -1
```

### Explanation:
- **Triangle Validation**: The function first checks the triangle inequality theorem: the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. If this condition fails, it returns -1.
- **Area Calculation**: If the sides are valid, it uses Heron's formula to compute the area:
  - Semi-perimeter \( s = \frac{a + b + c}{2} \)
  - Area = \( \sqrt{s \times (s - a) \times (s - b) \times (s - c)} \)
- **Rounding**: The area is rounded to 2 decimal places using `round(area, 2)`.
- **Edge Cases**: The function assumes inputs are numbers (as per the examples). If sides are non-positive or invalid, the inequality check will handle it by returning -1.

You can test this function directly. For example:
- `triangle_area(3, 4, 5)` should return `6.0`
- `triangle_area(1, 2, 10)` should return `-1`",0.0097963,18.04154109954834,0,0,MajorityVoting-k3,,

```

### Explanation:
- The function iterates through the list starting from index 1 (since the constant term's derivative is 0).
- For each coefficient at index `i`, it multiplies the coefficient by `i` (the power of x) and adds it to the result list.
- The result is a new list representing the coefficients of the derivative polynomial.

humaneval,HumanEval/148,MV-3,1,"The problem asks us to find all planets located strictly between two given planets in our solar system, ordered by their proximity to the Sun. We need to handle invalid planet names gracefully by returning an empty tuple.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1.  **Define the Solar System Planets**: First, we need an authoritative list of the eight planets in their correct order from the Sun. This list will be our reference.
    ```python
    PLANETS = (""Mercury"", ""Venus"", ""Earth"", ""Mars"", ""Jupiter"", ""Saturn"", ""Uranus"", ""Neptune"")
    ```

2.  **Validate Input**: Check if both `planet1` and `planet2` are valid names present in our `PLANETS` list. If either name is not found, the function should immediately return an empty tuple `()`.

3.  **Find Indices**: If both planet names are valid, find their respective indices in the `PLANETS` list. This will give us their positions relative to the Sun.
    ```python
    idx1 = PLANETS.index(planet1)
    idx2 = PLANETS.index(planet2)
    ```

4.  **Determine the Range**: The planets ""between"" `planet1` and `planet2` will be those whose indices are strictly greater than the minimum of `idx1` and `idx2`, and strictly less than the maximum of `idx1` and `idx2`.
    We can find the smaller and larger of the two indices:
    ```python
    start_idx = min(idx1, idx2)
    end_idx = max(idx1, idx2)
    ```
    The slice of planets will then be from `start_idx + 1` up to, but not including, `end_idx`.

5.  **Extract and Return**: Use Python's list/tuple slicing to extract the planets within this range. The slice `PLANETS[start_idx + 1 : end_idx]` will correctly return an empty tuple if `start_idx + 1` is greater than or equal to `end_idx` (e.g., if the planets are adjacent or the same).
    ```python
    result = PLANETS[start_idx + 1 : end_idx]
    ```
    Since `PLANETS` is already a tuple, the slice operation directly returns a tuple, fulfilling the output type requirement.

humaneval,HumanEval/109,MV-3,1,"To determine if it's possible to sort the array in non-decreasing order by performing right shift operations, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand Right Shift**: A right shift operation moves the last element of the array to the front. For example, shifting `[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]` once results in `[2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`.

2. **Identify Sorted Array**: We need to check if there exists a point in the array where we can ""cut"" the array and rearrange it such that the left part is less than or equal to the right part, and the right part wraps around to the left part.

3. **Count Descending Pairs**: We can iterate through the array and count how many times an element is greater than the next element. If this count is more than 1, it means we cannot sort the array with any number of right shifts.

4. **Edge Cases**: If the array is empty, we return `True` as specified.

Here is the implementation of the above logic in Python:

```python
def move_one_ball(arr):
    """"""Determine if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by right shifts.""""""
    if not arr:  # If the array is empty
        return True

            count_desc += 1
            
    # If there is more than one descending pair, we cannot sort the array with shifts

# Example usage:
print(move_one_ball([3, 4, 5, 1, 2]))  # True
print(move_one_ball([3, 5, 4, 1, 2]))  # False
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We first check if the array is empty and return `True` if it is.
- We then iterate through the array, comparing each element with the next one (considering the array as circular).
- We count how many times we find a descending pair (where the current element is greater than the next).
- Finally, if we find more than one descending pair, we return `False`. Otherwise, we return `True`, indicating that the array can be sorted by right shifts.",0.0302945,41.7715322971344,0,0,MajorityVoting-k3,,

humaneval,HumanEval/65,MV-3,1,"To perform a circular shift, we first convert the integer `x` to a string to easily manipulate its digits.
Then, we determine the length of this string, which is the number of digits.

There are two main cases based on the `shift` value:

1.  **If `shift` is greater than the number of digits**:
    As per the problem description, we should return the digits reversed. This can be achieved by string slicing `[::-1]`.

2.  **If `shift` is less than or equal to the number of digits**:
    We need to perform a circular right shift.
    *   First, we calculate the `effective_shift` by taking `shift` modulo the number of digits. This handles cases where `shift` is a multiple of the number of digits (e.g., shifting by `n` positions is the same as shifting by `0` positions for an `n`-digit number).
    *   To perform a right circular shift by `effective_shift` positions, we take the last `effective_shift` characters of the string and place them at the beginning, followed by the remaining characters.
        *   The last `effective_shift` characters are `x_str[n - effective_shift:]`.
        *   The first `n - effective_shift` characters are `x_str[:n - effective_shift]`.
        *   Concatenating these two parts in the correct order gives the circularly shifted string.

Let's walk through an example: `circular_shift(12345, 2)`
1.  `x_str = ""12345""`
2.  `n = len(x_str) = 5`
3.  `shift = 2`. Since `shift <= n` (2 <= 5), we proceed with the circular shift logic.
4.  `effective_shift = shift % n = 2 % 5 = 2`.
5.  The part to move to the front is the last `2` digits: `x_str[5 - 2:] = x_str[3:] = ""45""`.
6.  The remaining part is the first `5 - 2 = 3` digits: `x_str[:5 - 2] = x_str[:3] = ""123""`.
7.  The result is `""45"" + ""123"" = ""45123""`.

Example for reversal: `circular_shift(123, 4)`
1.  `x_str = ""123""`
2.  `n = len(x_str) = 3`
3.  `shift = 4`. Since `shift > n` (4 > 3), we reverse.
4.  Result: `x_str[::-1] = ""321""`.

humaneval,HumanEval/139,MV-3,1,"To solve this problem, we need to compute the Brazilian factorial of a given integer `n`, which is defined as the product of factorials from `1!` up to `n!`. The solution involves efficiently calculating each factorial in sequence and multiplying them together to get the final result.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The Brazilian factorial of `n` is the product of factorials from `1!` to `n!`. For example, `special_factorial(4)` is calculated as `1! * 2! * 3! * 4! = 1 * 2 * 6 * 24 = 288`.
2. **Key Insight**: Instead of recalculating each factorial from scratch, we can compute each factorial iteratively by multiplying the previous factorial by the current number. This leverages the fact that `k! = (k-1)! * k`.
3. **Algorithm Selection**: 
   - Initialize `result` to 1 (the multiplicative identity).
   - Initialize `current_factorial` to 1 (since `1! = 1`).
   - Iterate from 1 to `n`:
     - Update `current_factorial` by multiplying it with the current number `i` (this computes `i!`).
     - Multiply `result` by `current_factorial` to accumulate the product of factorials.
4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in O(n) time since it processes each number from 1 to `n` exactly once. The space complexity is O(1) as it uses only a few variables for computation.

### Solution Code
```python
def special_factorial(n):
    result = 1
    current_factorial = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        current_factorial *= i
        result *= current_factorial
    return result
```

### Explanation
- **Initialization**: `result` is initialized to 1 to hold the final product, and `current_factorial` is set to 1 to start computing factorials.
- **Loop Through Numbers**: For each number `i` from 1 to `n`:
  - **Update Factorial**: `current_factorial` is multiplied by `i` to compute `i!` (e.g., `1! = 1`, `2! = 1 * 2 = 2`, `3! = 2 * 3 = 6`, etc",0.01385639,13.809714555740356,0,0,MajorityVoting-k3,,

### Explanation:
- **Input Validation**: I added a basic check to ensure the lengths of the lists are as expected, raising an error if not. This isn't strictly required by your description but makes the function more robust.
- **Building the Expression**: We start with the first operand as a string, then iteratively append each operator and the corresponding next operand.
- **Evaluation**: The `eval()` function parses and evaluates the string as a Python expression, respecting operator precedence (e.g., `*` and `**` are evaluated before `+` and `-`).
- **Example Usage**:
  - For `operator = ['+', '*', '-']` and `operand = [2, 3, 4, 5]`, the expression becomes `""2 + 3 * 4 - 5""`, which evaluates to `9`.
  - Another example: `operator = ['**', '//']` and `operand = [2, 3, 4]` results in `""2 ** 3 // 4""`, which evaluates to `(8 // 4) = 2`.

3. Collect the prime numbers in a list and return that list.

### Explanation:
- **Loop through the array**: We iterate over each element in `nums`.
- **First condition**: Check if the number is greater than 10.
- **Digit extraction**: For numbers passing the first check, we convert the absolute value to a string to easily access the first and last digits.
- **Second condition**: Verify if both the first and last digits are in the set of odd digits ('1', '3', '5', '7', '9').
- **Edge cases handled**:
  - Negative numbers: They won't pass the `num > 10` check, so they're skipped.
  - Empty array: The loop won't run, and it will return 0.
  - Single-digit numbers: They can't be greater than 10, so they're not considered.
- **Testing**:
  - `specialFilter([15, -73, 14, -15])` returns 1 (only 15 qualifies).
  - `specialFilter([33, -2, -3, 45, 21, 109])` returns 2 (33 and 109 qualify).

humaneval,HumanEval/110,MV-3,1,"Looking at this problem, I need to determine if I can exchange elements between two lists to make `lst1` contain only even numbers.

Let me think through the logic:

1. For `lst1` to contain only even numbers, I need exactly `len(lst1)` even numbers total
2. I can exchange any elements between the lists, so what matters is the **total count of even numbers** across both lists
3. If the total number of even numbers in both lists combined is at least `len(lst1)`, then I can move enough even numbers into `lst1`

Let me trace through the examples:
- `exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4])`: 
  - lst1 has 2 even numbers (2, 4)
  - lst2 has 2 even numbers (2, 4)
  - Total: 4 even numbers, need 4 for lst1 → YES ✓

- `exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4])`:
  - lst1 has 2 even numbers (2, 4)
  - lst2 has 2 even numbers (2, 4)
  - Total: 4 even numbers, need 4 for lst1 → Should be YES
  - But expected output is NO... let me reconsider

Wait, I need to re-read the problem. After exchange, `lst1` should have only even numbers, but `lst1` must still have the same length. So I need at least `len(lst1)` even numbers total across both lists.

Actually, looking at the second example again: we have 4 even numbers total and need 4, so it should work. But the expected answer is NO. Let me reconsider...

Oh! I see - in the second example, the total even count is actually 2 (from lst1: 2, 4) + 1 (from lst2: 4) = 3 even numbers. Wait, let me recount:
- lst2 = [1, 5, 3, 4]: only 4 is even, so 1 even number
- lst1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]: 2 and 4 are even, so 2 even numbers
- Total = 3 even numbers, but we need 4 → NO ✓

That makes sense now!

humaneval,HumanEval/80,MV-3,1,"To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string is ""happy"" based on specific conditions. A string is considered happy if its length is at least 3 and every set of three consecutive characters in the string consists of distinct characters. 

### Approach
1. **Check String Length**: If the length of the string is less than 3, it cannot meet the requirement of having three consecutive distinct characters, so we immediately return `False`.
2. **Iterate Through Triplets**: For strings of length 3 or more, we iterate through each possible triplet of consecutive characters. For each triplet, we check if all three characters are distinct.
3. **Early Termination**: If any triplet fails the distinctness check (i.e., any two characters in the triplet are the same), we return `False` immediately.
4. **Successful Check**: If all triplets pass the distinctness check, we return `True`.

### Solution Code
```python
def is_happy(s):
    n = len(s)
    if n < 3:
        return False
    for i in range(n - 2):
        if s[i] == s[i+1] or s[i] == s[i+2] or s[i+1] == s[i+2]:
            return False
    return True
```

### Explanation
1. **Initial Length Check**: The function first checks if the string length is less than 3. If so, it returns `False` because it's impossible to have three consecutive distinct characters.
2. **Triplet Check**: For strings of length 3 or more, the function iterates over each possible triplet of consecutive characters. For each triplet starting at index `i`, it checks if any two characters in the triplet (positions `i`, `i+1`, and `i+2`) are the same.
3. **Return Result**: If any triplet contains duplicate characters, the function returns `False` immediately. If all triplets pass the check (all characters are distinct), the function returns `True`.

This approach efficiently verifies the ""happiness"" of the string by leveraging early termination upon finding any invalid triplet, ensuring optimal performance. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string, as we process each triplet exactly once.

humaneval,HumanEval/86,MV-3,1,"The goal is to sort the characters within each ""word"" of a given string, while preserving the original spacing and the order of words. A ""word"" is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1.  **Iterate through the input string character by character.**
2.  **Maintain a `current_word`**: This will store the characters of the word currently being built. Using a list for `current_word` is efficient because characters can be appended quickly, and then the list can be sorted easily.
3.  **Maintain `result_parts`**: This list will store the processed words (as strings) and the original space blocks.
4.  **Handle spaces**:
    *   When a space character is encountered:
        *   If `current_word` is not empty, it means we've finished building a word. Sort its characters (based on ASCII value) and append the resulting string to `result_parts`. Then, clear `current_word`.
        *   Now, handle the space itself: If the last item added to `result_parts` was also a space (or a block of spaces), append the current space character to that last item to consolidate multiple spaces. Otherwise, add the current space character as a new item to `result_parts`. This ensures that blocks of spaces (e.g., ' ', ' ', '   ') are preserved as they were.
5.  **Handle non-space characters**:
    *   If a non-space character is encountered, simply append it to `current_word`.
6.  **Handle the last word**: After the loop finishes, there might be characters remaining in `current_word` (if the string doesn't end with a space). If so, sort these characters and append the resulting string to `result_parts`.
7.  **Join the parts**: Finally, join all the elements in `result_parts` into a single string.

**Example Breakdown (`Hello World!!!`)**:

1.  Initialize `result_parts = []`, `current_word = []`.
2.  **'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'**: These are appended to `current_word`. `current_word = ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']`.
3.  **' '**:
    *   `current_word` is not empty. Sort `['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']` to `['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']` (ASCII order). `result_parts.append(""Hello"")`. `current_word` becomes `[]`.
    *   `result_parts` is `['Hello']`. The last part is not a space. `result_parts.append(' ')`.
    *   `result_parts` is now `['Hello', ' ']`.
4.  **'W', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd', '!', '!', '!'**: These are appended to `current_word`. `current_word = ['W', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd', '!', '!', '!']`.
5.  **End of string**:
    *   `current_word` is not empty. Sort `['W', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd', '!', '!', '!']` to `['!', '!', '!', 'W', 'd', 'l', 'o', 'r']` (ASCII order). `result_parts.append(""!!!Wdlor"")`.
    *   `result_parts` is now `['Hello', ' ', '!!!Wdlor']`.

For large values of n, computing 2^n directly would be inefficient. Python's built-in `pow` function with three arguments efficiently computes modular exponentiation using the square-and-multiply algorithm.

Here's the solution:

```python
def modp(n: int, p: int):
    """"""Return 2^n modulo p (be aware of numerics).
    >>> modp(3, 5)
    3
    >>> modp(1101, 101)
    2
    >>> modp(0, 101)
    1
    >>> modp(3, 11)
    8
    >>> modp(100, 101)
    1
    """"""
    return pow(2, n, p)
```

**Explanation:**
- `pow(2, n, p)` computes 2^n mod p efficiently using modular exponentiation
- This avoids computing the potentially huge value of 2^n first
- Time complexity: O(log n)
- Works correctly for all edge cases including n=0

Alternative implementation (if we wanted to implement it manually):

```python
def modp(n: int, p: int):
    """"""Return 2^n modulo p (be aware of numerics).""""""
    result = 1
    base = 2 % p
    exponent = n
    
    while exponent > 0:
        if exponent % 2 == 1:
            result = (result * base) % p
        base = (base * base) % p
        exponent //= 2
    
    return result
```

3. If the result equals `x`, it returns `True`.

1. Calculate the sum of digits for each number (handling negative numbers correctly)
2. Sort by digit sum, but preserve original order for equal sums (stable sort)
3. Return the sorted list

Key consideration: For negative numbers, the negative sign applies to the entire number, not just the first digit. For example, -12 should have digit sum: -(1 + 2) = -3.

Let me trace through the example:
- `1`: sum = 1
- `11`: sum = 1 + 1 = 2
- `-1`: sum = -1
- `-11`: sum = -(1 + 1) = -2
- `-12`: sum = -(1 + 2) = -3

Sorted by sum: -12 (-3), -11 (-2), -1 (-1), 1 (1), 11 (2)

Wait, but the expected output is `[-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]`. Let me reconsider...

Actually, looking more carefully at the expected output, it seems like for negative numbers, only the first digit is negative:
- `-1`: sum = -1
- `-11`: sum = -1 + 1 = 0
- `-12`: sum = -1 + 2 = 1

Let me verify: [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]
- `-1`: -1
- `-11`: 0
- `1`: 1
- `-12`: 1 (same as `1`, so preserve original order)

That matches! So for negative numbers, only the leftmost digit is negative.

**How it works:**

1. **Find initial bounds**: Start with `left = -1000` and `right = 1000`. If the polynomial doesn't have opposite signs at these points, expand the range.

2. **Bisection method**: 
   - Calculate the midpoint
   - Evaluate the polynomial at the midpoint
   - If it's close enough to zero, return it
   - Otherwise, determine which half contains the zero (where signs differ) and continue searching in that half

3. **Convergence**: Continue until the interval is smaller than epsilon (very small number), ensuring high precision.

1. Count the frequency of each integer in the list
2. Find integers where frequency >= the integer's value
3. Return the greatest such integer, or -1 if none exist

Let me trace through the examples:
- `[4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]`: frequencies are {4:1, 1:2, 2:2, 3:1}
  - 4 appears 1 time, need 4: ✗
  - 1 appears 2 times, need 1: ✓
  - 2 appears 2 times, need 2: ✓
  - 3 appears 1 time, need 3: ✗
  - Greatest valid: 2 ✓

- `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]`: frequencies are {1:1, 2:2, 3:3, 4:3}
  - 1 appears 1 time, need 1: ✓
  - 2 appears 2 times, need 2: ✓
  - 3 appears 3 times, need 3: ✓
  - 4 appears 3 times, need 4: ✗
  - Greatest valid: 3 ✓

humaneval,HumanEval/129,MV-3,1,"The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest path of a given length `k` in an `N x N` grid. We can start from any cell, and from any cell, we can move to an adjacent cell (up, down, left, right). Cells can be visited multiple times.

This is a classic search problem, best solved using a Depth-First Search (DFS) combined with pruning to handle the lexicographical comparison efficiently.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1.  **Initialization**:
    *   `N`: The dimension of the grid (`len(grid)`).
    *   `min_path_values`: This list will store the lexicographically smallest path found so far. It's initialized with `k` `float('inf')` values, ensuring that any valid path of length `k` will be lexicographically smaller than this initial value.
    *   `dr`, `dc`: Arrays to represent the four possible directions of movement (up, down, left, right).
    *   `current_path_list`: A list to store the values of the cells in the path currently being explored by the DFS. This list is modified using `append` and `pop` for efficiency, avoiding expensive list concatenations.

2.  **Depth-First Search (DFS) Function (`dfs(r, c)`)**:
    *   **Add Current Cell**: When the `dfs` function is called for a cell `(r, c)`, its value `grid[r][c]` is appended to `current_path_list`.
    *   **Pruning**: This is the critical optimization. Before proceeding with further recursion or checking the base case, we compare the `current_path_list` (up to its current length) with the `min_path_values` (up to the same length).
        *   If `current_path_list` is already lexicographically *greater* than the prefix of `min_path_values` of the same length, then this branch of the search *cannot* lead to a better path. In this case, we `pop` the current cell's value from `current_path_list` (backtrack) and return, effectively pruning this branch.
        *   Python's list comparison (`>`) correctly implements lexicographical comparison, which is very convenient.
    *   **Base Case**: If the `current_path_list` has reached length `k`:
        *   This means we have found a complete path of length `k`.
        *   We compare `current_path_list` with `min_path_values`. If `current_path_list` is lexicographically smaller, we update `min_path_values` with a copy of `current_path_list`.
        *   After processing, we `pop` the current cell's value from `current_path_list` (backtrack) and return.
    *   **Recursive Step**: For each of the four possible neighbors `(nr, nc)` of the current cell `(r, c)`:
        *   Check if `(nr, nc)` is within the grid boundaries (`0 <= nr < N` and `0 <= nc < N`).
        *   If valid, recursively call `dfs(nr, nc)`.
    *   **Backtrack**: After all neighbors of `(r, c)` have been explored (or pruned), `pop` the current cell's value from `current_path_list`. This ensures that `current_path_list` is correctly maintained for previous recursive calls.

3.  **Main Loop**:
    *   The problem states that we can start from *any* cell. So, we iterate through all cells `(r_start, c_start)` in the grid.
    *   For each starting cell, we initiate the `dfs(r_start, c_start)`.

4.  **Return Value**: After exploring all possible paths from all starting cells, `min_path_values` will hold the lexicographically smallest path, which is then returned.

**Lexicographical Comparison Explanation**:
Python's list comparison `list_A < list_B` performs lexicographical comparison:
*   It compares elements at index 0. If `list_A[0] < list_B[0]`, then `list_A` is smaller. If `list_A[0] > list_B[0]`, then `list_A` is greater.
*   If `list_A[0] == list_B[0]`, it moves to compare elements at index 1, and so on.
*   If one list is a prefix of another (e.g., `[1, 2]` vs `[1, 2, 3]`), the shorter list is considered smaller. Our pruning condition `current_path_list > min_path_values[:current_len]` leverages this by comparing prefixes of the same length.

**Example Trace (Input: `grid = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]], k = 3`)**:

1.  `min_path_values = [inf, inf, inf]`, `current_path_list = []`.
2.  Start `dfs(0,0)` (value 1):
    *   `current_path_list` becomes `[1]`.
    *   No pruning (as `[1]` is not `> [inf]`). Not length `k`.
    *   Explore neighbors:
        *   `dfs(0,1)` (value 2):
            *   `current_path_list` becomes `[1, 2]`.
            *   No pruning. Not length `k`.
            *   Explore neighbors:
                *   `dfs(0,0)` (value 1):
                    *   `current_path_list` becomes `[1, 2, 1]`.
                    *   No pruning. Length `k`.
                    *   `[1, 2, 1] < [inf, inf, inf]` is true. `min_path_values` becomes `[1, 2, 1]`.
                    *   Pop `1`. `current_path_list` is `[1, 2]`. Return.
                *   `dfs(0,2)` (value 3):
                    *   `current_path_list` becomes `[1, 2, 3]`.
                    *   `[1, 2, 3] > min_path_values[:3]` (`[1, 2, 3] > [1, 2, 1]`) is true. Prune.
                    *   Pop `3`. `current_path_list` is `[1, 2]`. Return.
                *   `dfs(1,1)` (value 5):
                    *   `current_path_list` becomes `[1, 2, 5]`.
                    *   `[1, 2, 5] > min_path_values[:3]` (`[1, 2, 5] > [1, 2, 1]`) is true. Prune.
                    *   Pop `5`. `current_path_list` is `[1, 2]`. Return.
            *   Pop `2`. `current_path_list` is `[1]`. Return.
        *   `dfs(1,0)` (value 4):
            *   `current_path_list` becomes `[1, 4]`.
            *   `[1, 4] > min_path_values[:2]` (`[1, 4] > [1, 2]`) is true. Prune.
            *   Pop `4`. `current_path_list` is `[1]`. Return.
    *   Pop `1`. `current_path_list` is `[]`. Return.

This process continues for all starting cells, but due to effective pruning, many branches will be quickly discarded once `min_path_values` is set to `[1, 2, 1]`.

**Complexity**:
*   **Time Complexity**: In the worst case, without pruning, the complexity would be `O(N^2 * 4^k)`. With pruning, the actual runtime is significantly reduced. The number of paths explored is still exponential in `k`, but many branches are cut short. Each list comparison takes `O(k)` time. So, the theoretical worst case remains `O(N^2 * 4^k * k)`, but practical performance is much better for reasonable `k`.
*   **Space Complexity**: `O(k)` for the recursion stack (depth `k`) and `current_path_list`, plus `O(k)` for `min_path_values`.

humaneval,HumanEval/125,MV-3,1,"To solve this problem, we need to handle different cases of splitting a string based on specific conditions. The solution involves checking for whitespaces first, then commas if no whitespaces are found, and finally counting lowercase letters with odd positions in the alphabet if neither whitespaces nor commas are present.

### Approach
1. **Check for Whitespaces**: If the input string contains any whitespace characters, split the string using whitespace and return the resulting list.
2. **Check for Commas**: If no whitespaces are found, check for commas. If commas exist, split the string using commas and return the resulting list.
3. **Count Lowercase Letters with Odd Positions**: If neither whitespaces nor commas are found, iterate through each character in the string. For each lowercase letter, calculate its position in the alphabet (where 'a' is 0, 'b' is 1, etc.). Count how many of these positions are odd numbers.

### Solution Code
```python
def split_words(txt):
    if ' ' in txt:
        return txt.split()
    elif ',' in txt:
        return txt.split(',')
    else:
        count = 0
        for char in txt:
            if 'a' <= char <= 'z':
                order = ord(char) - ord('a')
                if order % 2 == 1:
                    count += 1
        return count
```

### Explanation
1. **Whitespace Handling**: The function first checks if there are any whitespaces in the string. If found, it splits the string using the `split()` method, which by default splits on whitespace, and returns the list of substrings.
2. **Comma Handling**: If no whitespaces are found, the function checks for commas. If commas are present, it splits the string using commas and returns the resulting list.
3. **Counting Lowercase Letters**: If neither whitespaces nor commas are found, the function processes each character in the string. For each lowercase letter, it calculates its position in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', etc.). If the position is an odd number, it increments the count. The final count is returned as the result.

This approach efficiently handles all three cases specified in the problem, ensuring the correct output based on the presence of whitespaces, commas, or neither.

3. **Identify uppercase vowels**: If the character at an even index is an uppercase vowel (A, E, I, O, or U), increment the count.
4. **Return the count**: After processing all characters, return the total count of uppercase vowels found at even indices.

### Solution Code
```python
def count_upper(s):
    count = 0
    vowels = ""AEIOU""
    for index, char in enumerate(s):
        if index % 2 == 0 and char in vowels:
            count += 1
    return count
```

### Explanation
- **Initialization**: We start with `count` set to 0 to keep track of valid uppercase vowels.
- **Vowel Check**: The string `vowels` contains all uppercase vowels for quick comparison.
- **Loop with Index**: Using `enumerate(s)`, we iterate through each character `char` and its `index`.
- **Condition Check**: For each character, we check:
  - If the index is even (`index % 2 == 0`).
  - If the character is in the predefined `vowels` string.
- **Increment Count**: When both conditions are met, we increment `count`.
- **Return Result**: The function returns the total count after processing all characters.

### Examples
- **`count_upper('aBCdEf')`**: 
  - Index 0: 'a' (not uppercase vowel) → skip.
  - Index 1: 'B' (odd index) → skip.
  - Index 2: 'C' (not vowel) → skip.
  - Index 3: 'd' (odd index) → skip.
  - Index 4: 'E' (uppercase vowel at even index) → count = 1.
  - Returns `1`.

- **`count_upper('abcdefg')`**:
  - No uppercase vowels at even indices → returns `0`.

- **`count_upper('dBBE')`**:
  - Index 0: 'd' (not uppercase vowel) → skip.
  - Index 1: 'B' (odd index) → skip.
  - Index 2: 'B' (not vowel) → skip.
  - Index 3: 'E' (odd index) → skip.
  - Returns `0`.

humaneval,HumanEval/33,MV-3,1,"Here's the implementation of the `sort_third` function based on the description in the docstring. I'll first explain the reasoning briefly, then provide the complete, executable code.

### Reasoning:
- We need to identify elements in the list at indices divisible by 3 (i.e., indices where `i % 3 == 0`).
- Extract these elements, sort them in ascending order.
- Create a new list that is a copy of the original list.
- Replace the elements in the new list at indices divisible by 3 with the sorted elements, in the order they appear in the sorted sublist.
- For indices not divisible by 3, keep the original elements unchanged.
- Handle edge cases like an empty list or lists of various lengths.

Now, here's the clean and executable Python code:

```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """"""
    This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l at indices that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal

    >>> sort_third([1, 2, 3])
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])
    [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
    """"""
    if not l:  # Handle empty list
        return l
    
    # Extract elements at indices divisible by 3
    elements_to_sort = [l[i] for i in range(len(l)) if i % 3 == 0]
    
    # Sort the extracted elements
    sorted_elements = sorted(elements_to_sort)
    
    # Create a copy of the original list
    new_l = l.copy()
    
    # Replace elements at indices divisible by 3 with the sorted ones
    index_for_sorted = 0  # Tracker for the sorted elements list
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if i % 3 == 0 and index_for_sorted < len(sorted_elements):

            index_for_sorted += 1  # Move to the next sorted element
    
    return new_l
```

### Verification with Examples:
- `sort_third([1, 2, 3])`: Elements at index 0: [1]. Sorted: [1]. Result: [1, 2, 3].
- `sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])`: Elements at indices 0, 3, 6: [5, 4, 2]. Sorted: [2, 4, 5]. Result: [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5].

humaneval,HumanEval/82,MV-3,1,"To determine if the length of a string is a prime number, we first need to calculate the string's length and then check if that number is prime.

Here's the logic for checking if a number `n` is prime:
1.  **Numbers less than 2**: Any number less than 2 (i.e., 0, 1, negative numbers) is not prime.
2.  **The number 2**: The number 2 is the only even prime number.
3.  **Even numbers greater than 2**: Any even number greater than 2 is not prime, as it is divisible by 2.
4.  **Odd numbers greater than 2**: For odd numbers, we need to check for divisibility by odd numbers starting from 3 up to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, it's not prime. If it's not divisible by any of them, then it is prime. We only need to check up to the square root because if a number `n` has a divisor `d` greater than `sqrt(n)`, it must also have a divisor `n/d` which is less than `sqrt(n)`.

### Explanation:
- We loop through the list using the index (`i`) to check both the index and the element.
- An odd index is identified by `i % 2 != 0`.
- An even element is identified by `lst[i] % 2 == 0` (this works for positive, negative, and zero values).
- We add up only the elements that meet both conditions.
- The function returns the total sum.

### Approach
1. **Check for Empty String**: If the input string is empty, return an empty list immediately.
2. **Split Words**: Split the input string into individual words based on spaces.
3. **Identify Vowels**: Define a set of vowels (both lowercase and uppercase) for efficient checking.
4. **Count Consonants**: For each word, count the consonants by checking each character. A character is a consonant if it is an alphabetic character and not a vowel.
5. **Filter Words**: Collect words that have exactly `n` consonants, maintaining their order of appearance in the original string.

```

### Explanation
1. **Initial Check**: The function first checks if the input string `s` is empty. If it is, an empty list is returned.
2. **Vowel Definition**: The vowels are defined in a string containing both lowercase and uppercase letters to handle case insensitivity.
3. **Word Splitting**: The input string is split into individual words using the `split()` method, which separates the string at each space.
4. **Consonant Counting**: For each word, the function iterates through each character. If a character is an alphabetic letter and not a vowel, it increments the consonant count.
5. **Result Compilation**: Words with exactly `n` consonants are added to the result list. The order of these words in the result list matches their appearance in the original string.

This approach efficiently processes each word, counts consonants accurately, and compiles the result list based on the specified consonant count.

    Examples:
    >>> sorted_list_sum([""aa"", ""a"", ""aaa""])

# print(sorted_list_sum([""aa"", ""a"", ""aaa""]))  # Output: ['aa']
# print(sorted_list_sum([""ab"", ""a"", ""aaa"", ""cd""]))  # Output: ['ab', 'cd']
```

### Explanation:
- **Filtering**: I use a list comprehension to create a new list that only includes strings with even lengths (i.e., `len(item) % 2 == 0`).
- **Sorting**: The `sorted()` function is used with a lambda key that returns a tuple `(len(x), x)`. This sorts primarily by string length (ascending) and secondarily by the string itself (alphabetical order).
- **Edge Cases Handled**:
  - If the input list is empty, the function returns an empty list.
  - Duplicates are preserved as per the sorting rules.
  - The function assumes all elements are strings, as stated in the docstring.

humaneval,HumanEval/123,MV-3,1,"The Collatz conjecture describes a sequence where, starting with a positive integer `n`, the next term is half of the current term if it's even, or three times the current term plus one if it's odd. The sequence continues until it reaches 1.

The `get_odd_collatz` function needs to:
1. Generate the Collatz sequence starting from `n`.
2. Identify all odd numbers that appear in this sequence.
3. Remove any duplicate odd numbers (since numbers might repeat in intermediate sequences if they don't reach 1 directly).
4. Return these unique odd numbers in a sorted list (increasing order).

Here's the step-by-step implementation:

1.  **Initialize a set**: A `set` is used to store the odd numbers because it automatically handles duplicates, ensuring that each odd number is stored only once.
2.  **Start the Collatz sequence**: Set `current_n` to the input `n`.
3.  **Loop until 1 is reached**: Use a `while True` loop that breaks when `current_n` becomes 1. This ensures that the initial `n` is always processed and the sequence correctly terminates at 1.
4.  **Check for odd numbers**: Inside the loop, before applying the Collatz rule, check if `current_n` is odd (`current_n % 2 != 0`). If it is, add it to the `odd_numbers_set`.
5.  **Termination condition**: After checking for odd numbers, check if `current_n` is 1. If it is, the sequence has ended, so `break` the loop.
6.  **Apply Collatz rule**:
    *   If `current_n` is even (`current_n % 2 == 0`), divide it by 2 (`current_n = current_n // 2`).
    *   If `current_n` is odd (and not 1, as the `break` handles 1), multiply it by 3 and add 1 (`current_n = 3 * current_n + 1`).
7.  **Sort and return**: After the loop finishes, convert the `odd_numbers_set` to a list and sort it in increasing order using `sorted()`.

```python
def get_odd_collatz(n):
    """"""
    Given a positive integer n, return a sorted list that has the odd numbers in collatz sequence.

    The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined
    as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the 
    previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of 
    the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous
    term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.

Let me think through the approach:
- The string can have commas, spaces, or both as separators

- The examples show that commas are followed by spaces, but I should handle various cases

Here's my solution:

```python
def words_string(s):

    You will be given a string of words separated by commas or spaces. Your task is
    to split the string into words and return an array of the words.

**How it works:**
1. `s.replace(',', ' ')` - Replace all commas with spaces
2. `s.split()` - Split on any whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines). When called without arguments, `split()` automatically handles multiple consecutive spaces and strips leading/trailing whitespace
3. The list comprehension `[word for word in s.split() if word]` ensures we only keep non-empty strings (though `split()` without arguments already does this)

**Alternative, more concise solution:**
```python
def words_string(s):
    return s.replace(',', ' ').split()
```

This works because `split()` without arguments automatically:
- Splits on any whitespace
- Removes empty strings from the result
- Handles multiple consecutive spaces

### Explanation:
- **Line 1:** Check if `x > y`. If true, immediately return `-1`.
- **Loop:** Start from `y` and decrement down to `x` (inclusive). For each number, check if it's even using `i % 2 == 0`.
- **Return:** If an even number is found, return it immediately (this ensures we get the largest one).
- **Edge Cases Handled:**
  - If `x > y`, returns `-1`.
  - If the range has no even numbers (e.g., `choose_num(1, 1)`), the loop completes without returning, so `-1` is returned.
  - If `x == y` and it's even (e.g., `choose_num(2, 2)`), it returns `2`.
  - If `x == y` and it's odd (e.g., `choose_num(1, 1)`), it returns `-1`.

humaneval,HumanEval/66,MV-3,1,"To solve this problem, we need to write a function that takes a string as input and returns the sum of the ASCII values of all uppercase characters in the string. Non-uppercase characters should be ignored.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The task requires iterating through each character in the input string, checking if it is an uppercase letter, and summing the ASCII values of these letters.
2. **Key Insight**: Uppercase characters can be identified using the `isupper()` method available for strings in Python.
3. **Algorithm Selection**: Traverse the string character by character. For each character, check if it is uppercase. If it is, compute its ASCII value using the `ord()` function and accumulate the sum.
4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves a single pass through the string, making the time complexity O(n), where n is the length of the string. The space complexity is O(1) since we only use a variable to store the sum.

### Solution Code
```python
def digitSum(s):
    total = 0
    for char in s:
        if char.isupper():
            total += ord(char)
    return total
```

### Explanation
- **Initialization**: The variable `total` is initialized to 0 to accumulate the sum of ASCII values.
- **Character Iteration**: The loop iterates over each character in the input string `s`.
- **Uppercase Check**: For each character, the `isupper()` method checks if it is an uppercase letter.
- **Sum Calculation**: If the character is uppercase, its ASCII value (obtained via `ord(char)`) is added to `total`.
- **Return Result**: After processing all characters, the accumulated `total` is returned.

This approach efficiently processes the input string in linear time, ensuring optimal performance while correctly summing the ASCII values of uppercase characters as demonstrated in the provided examples.",0.01070271,16.4622745513916,0,0,MajorityVoting-k3,,
humaneval,HumanEval/59,MV-3,1,"To implement the `largest_prime_factor` function, we need to find the largest prime factor of a given integer `n`. The approach involves dividing `n` by its smallest factors until we reach a prime factor. Here's how we can do it step by step:

1. Start with the smallest prime number, which is 2.
2. Divide `n` by 2 until it is no longer divisible by 2. This handles all factors of 2.
3. Move to the next odd numbers (3, 5, 7, ...) and repeat the process.
4. Continue this until the square root of `n` because a larger factor of `n` must be paired with a smaller factor that has already been checked.
5. If after all divisions `n` is still greater than 2, then `n` itself is a prime factor.

humaneval,HumanEval/10,MV-3,1,"To create the shortest palindrome that begins with a given string, we follow the algorithm described in the problem's docstring:

1.  **Find the longest palindromic postfix:** We iterate through all possible postfixes of the input string, starting from the full string itself, then `string[1:]`, `string[2:]`, and so on, down to the empty string. The first postfix we encounter that is a palindrome will be the longest one.
    *   We can use the provided `is_palindrome` helper function to check if a substring is a palindrome.
    *   By iterating `k` from `0` to `len(string)`, `string[k:]` will give us postfixes. The smallest `k` for which `string[k:]` is a palindrome corresponds to the longest palindromic postfix.

2.  **Identify the prefix:** Once the longest palindromic postfix `string[k:]` is found, the part of the original string that comes *before* this postfix is `string[0:k]`. This is the prefix we need to reverse and append.

3.  **Construct the palindrome:** The shortest palindrome is formed by taking the original `string` and appending the reversed `prefix_to_reverse` to its end.

Let's walk through an example: `string = 'cata'`

1.  **Iterate `k` to find the longest palindromic postfix:**
    *   `k = 0`: `postfix = 'cata'`. `is_palindrome('cata')` is `False` (`'cata'` != `'atac'`).
    *   `k = 1`: `postfix = 'ata'`. `is_palindrome('ata')` is `True` (`'ata'` == `'ata'`).
        *   We found the longest palindromic postfix: `'ata'`.

2.  **Identify the prefix to reverse:**
    *   The prefix before `'ata'` is `string[0:1]`, which is `'c'`.

3.  **Construct the palindrome:**
    *   Reverse the prefix: `'c'[::-1]` which is still `'c'`.
    *   Append it to the original string: `'cata' + 'c'` = `'catac'`.

This results in `'catac'`, which is the shortest palindrome starting with `'cata'`.

**Edge Cases:**
*   **Empty String `''`**:
    *   `k = 0`: `postfix = ''`. `is_palindrome('')` is `True`.
    *   `prefix_to_reverse = ''`.
    *   Result: `'' + ''[::-1]` = `''`. Correct.
*   **Already a Palindrome `racecar`**:
    *   `k = 0`: `postfix = 'racecar'`. `is_palindrome('racecar')` is `True`.
    *   `prefix_to_reverse = ''`.
    *   Result: `'racecar' + ''[::-1]` = `'racecar'`. Correct.

humaneval,HumanEval/132,MV-3,1,"Looking at this problem, I need to determine if there's a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket is nested.

Let me analyze the examples:
- `'[[]]'` → True (valid nested brackets)
- `'[]]]]]]][[[[[]'` → False (no valid nested structure)
- `'[][]'` → False (valid but no nesting)
- `'[]'` → False (valid but no nesting)
- `'[[][]]'` → True (has nested brackets)
- `'[[]][[`' → True (has valid nested part `[[]]`)

The key insight: We need to find if there exists a valid bracket subsequence that contains at least 2 levels of nesting (at least one `[` inside another `[...]`).

**Strategy**: 
1. Track the maximum nesting depth while parsing valid brackets
2. If we ever reach a depth ≥ 2, we have nesting
3. We need to handle invalid sequences by ignoring unmatched closing brackets

```python
def is_nested(string):
    '''
    Create a function that takes a string as input which contains only square brackets.
    The function should return True if and only if there is a valid subsequence of brackets 
    where at least one bracket in the subsequence is nested.

            max_depth = max(max_depth, depth)
        elif char == ']':
            if depth > 0:  # Only decrease if we have a matching opening bracket
                depth -= 1
    
    # We need at least depth 2 to have nesting
    return max_depth >= 2
```

Wait, let me reconsider. Looking at `'[]]]]]]][[[[[]'`:
- This would give max_depth of 4 from the `[[[[` part, but the answer should be False
- The issue is that those opening brackets don't have matching closing brackets

Let me revise: we need to find a **valid** nested structure. Let me try a different approach - check from both directions:

            depth += 1
            # Check if this opening bracket can be validly closed
            # and if we're already at depth >= 1 (meaning this would be nested)
            if depth >= 2:
                # Look ahead to see if we can find matching closing brackets
                temp_depth = depth
                for j in range(i + 1, len(string)):
                    if string[j] == '[':
                        temp_depth += 1
                    elif string[j] == ']':
                        temp_depth -= 1
                        if temp_depth == depth - 1:
                            # Found a valid closing for current bracket while nested

3.  **Clean and check each sentence:** For each non-empty sentence fragment:

- The `bin(decimal)` function converts the decimal number to a binary string prefixed with '0b'.

### Explanation:
- **Set Conversion**: `set(s0)` and `set(s1)` extract the unique characters from each string.
- **Comparison**: The function compares the two sets. If they are equal, it means both strings have exactly the same unique characters.
- **Edge Cases Handled**:
  - Empty strings: `same_chars('', '')` returns `True`.
  - Case sensitivity: The function treats uppercase and lowercase letters as distinct (e.g., `same_chars('a', 'A')` returns `False`).
  - Special characters: It works with any characters, as sets include all Unicode characters.

humaneval,HumanEval/50,MV-3,1,"Looking at the `encode_shift` function, I need to understand what it does and then reverse the operation.

**Analysis of `encode_shift`:**
- It shifts each character forward by 5 positions in the alphabet
- Uses modulo 26 to wrap around (e.g., 'x' + 5 = 'c')
- Formula: `((ord(ch) + 5 - ord(""a"")) % 26) + ord(""a"")`

**To decode:**
- I need to shift backward by 5 positions
- This means subtracting 5 instead of adding 5
- Formula: `((ord(ch) - 5 - ord(""a"")) % 26) + ord(""a"")`

Here's the solution:

```python
def decode_shift(s: str):
    """"""
    takes as input string encoded with encode_shift function. Returns decoded string.
    """"""
    return """".join([chr(((ord(ch) - 5 - ord(""a"")) % 26) + ord(""a"")) for ch in s])
```

**How it works:**
1. For each character `ch` in the encoded string
2. Convert to position in alphabet: `ord(ch) - ord(""a"")`
3. Shift back by 5: subtract 5
4. Apply modulo 26 to handle wrap-around (e.g., 'b' - 5 = 'w')
5. Convert back to character: add `ord(""a"")` and use `chr()`

**Example:**
- If `encode_shift(""hello"")` produces `""mjqqt""` (h→m, e→j, l→q, l→q, o→t)
- Then `decode_shift(""mjqqt"")` returns `""hello""` (m→h, j→e, q→l, q→l, t→o)",0.00812095,8.665643692016602,0,0,MajorityVoting-k3,,

1. Find the intersection of two intervals
2. Calculate the length of the intersection
3. Check if that length is a prime number
4. Return ""YES"" if prime, ""NO"" otherwise

Let me think through this step by step:

**Finding the intersection:**
- The intersection starts at `max(start1, start2)`
- The intersection ends at `min(end1, end2)`
- If start > end, there's no intersection

**Calculating length:**
- For a closed interval (a, b), the length is `b - a + 1` (includes both endpoints)

**Checking for prime:**
- A prime number is greater than 1 and only divisible by 1 and itself
- Need to handle edge cases (numbers ≤ 1 are not prime)

**Verification with examples:**

1. `intersection((1, 2), (2, 3))`:

   - 1 is not prime → ""NO"" ✓

2. `intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4))`: 
   - Intersection: (0, 1), length = 2
   - 2 is prime → Should be ""YES"", but example shows ""NO""
   - Wait, let me recalculate: 0 to 1 inclusive = 2 points, length = 1 + 1 - 0 = 2
   - Actually 2 IS prime... Let me check the example again.
   - Length = 1 - 0 + 1 = 2, which is prime. The expected output might be wrong in the problem statement, or I should return ""NO"" for length 2. Let me check example 3.

3. `intersection((-3, -1), (-5, 5))`:

humaneval,HumanEval/115,MV-3,1,"Below is the complete implementation of the `max_fill` function based on the problem description. The function calculates the total number of times buckets need to be lowered to empty all the wells.

### Explanation:
- Each row in the grid represents a well.
- For each well (row), count the number of units of water (i.e., the number of 1s).
- To empty a well with `n` units of water and a bucket capacity of `capacity`, the number of lowers needed is the ceiling of `n / capacity`, because you might not fill the bucket completely on the last lower.
- Sum up the lowers needed for all wells.

Here's the updated function:

```python
def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    import math  # For math.ceil
    
    total_lowers = 0  # Initialize the total count of lowers
    
    for row in grid:  # Iterate through each row (well)
        count_ones = sum(1 for elem in row if elem == 1)  # Count the number of 1s in the row
        if count_ones > 0:  # Only calculate if there are units of water
            lowers_for_row = math.ceil(count_ones / capacity)  # Ceiling of (count_ones / capacity)
            total_lowers += lowers_for_row  # Add to the total
    
    return total_lowers  # Return the total number of lowers
```

### Example Walkthrough:
1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `grid = [[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]]`, `capacity = 1`
   - Row 1: 1 one → ceil(1 / 1) = 1
   - Row 2: 1 one → ceil(1 / 1) = 1
   - Row 3: 4 ones → ceil(4 / 1) = 4
   - Total: 1 + 1 + 4 = 6

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `grid = [[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]]`, `capacity = 2`
   - Row 1: 2 ones → ceil(2 / 2) = 1
   - Row 2: 0 ones → ceil(0 / 2) = 0
   - Row 3: 3 ones → ceil(3 / 2) = 2
   - Row 4: 3 ones → ceil(3 / 2) = 2
   - Total: 1 + 0 + 2 + 2 = 5

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `grid = [[0,0,0], [0,0,0]]`, `capacity = 5`
   - Row 1: 0 ones → ceil(0 / 5) = 0

humaneval,HumanEval/5,MV-3,1,"To solve this problem, we need to insert a delimiter between every two consecutive elements of a given list. The solution involves iterating through the list while adding each element followed by the delimiter, except for the last element where no delimiter is added after it.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The task requires inserting a delimiter between consecutive elements in a list. The key observation is that the delimiter should not be added after the last element.
2. **Algorithm Selection**: We iterate through each element of the input list. For each element except the last one, we add the element followed by the delimiter. For the last element, we add only the element.
3. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in O(n) time, where n is the length of the input list. This is because we process each element exactly once. The space complexity is O(n) to store the result.

### Solution Code
```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for i, num in enumerate(numbers):
        result.append(num)
        if i < len(numbers) - 1:
            result.append(delimeter)
    return result
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: An empty list `result` is initialized to store the output.
2. **Iteration**: We loop through each element in the input list `numbers` along with its index.
3. **Appending Elements**: Each element from `numbers` is appended to `result`.
4. **Appending Delimiter**: After each element (except the last one), the delimiter is appended to `result`.
5. **Return Result**: The constructed list `result` is returned, which contains the original elements interspersed with the delimiter.

This approach efficiently handles edge cases such as an empty input list and ensures the delimiter is placed only between consecutive elements, not after the last element.",0.01135778,8.881773948669434,0,0,MajorityVoting-k3,,

3. Groups with fewer than 3 characters remain unchanged

To decode, I need to reverse this operation. For a group of 3 characters that was cycled, I need to move the last character to the beginning (e.g., ""bca"" → ""abc"").

- Original: ""abcdef""
- Groups: [""abc"", ""def""]
- After cycling: [""bca"", ""efd""]

To decode ""bcaefd"":

    the order of the words in the new string should be the same as the original one.

    Example 1:
        Input: sentence = ""This is a test""
        Output: ""is""

    Example 2:
        Input: sentence = ""lets go for swimming""
        Output: ""go for""

    Constraints:
        * 1 <= len(sentence) <= 100
        * sentence contains only letters
    """"""
    words = sentence.split()  # Split the sentence into a list of words
    result_words = []  # List to store words with prime lengths
    
    for word in words:
        if is_prime(len(word)):  # Check if the length of the word is prime
            result_words.append(word)  # Add the word if its length is prime
    
    return ' '.join(result_words)  # Join the filtered words with spaces and return
```

### Explanation:
- **is_prime function**: This checks if a given number (the length of a word) is prime. It iterates from 2 up to the square root of the number for efficiency.
- **words_in_sentence function**:
  - Splits the input sentence into a list of words using `sentence.split()`, which handles spaces automatically.
  - Iterates through each word, checks if its length is prime using the helper function.
  - Collects qualifying words in a list while preserving their original order.
  - Joins the collected words with spaces and returns the result. If no words qualify, it returns an empty string.

### Example Usage:
You can test this function in a Python environment like this:

```python
# Example 1
sentence1 = ""This is a test""
print(words_in_sentence(sentence1))  # Output: ""is""

# Example 2
sentence2 = ""lets go for swimming""
print(words_in_sentence(sentence2))  # Output: ""go for""

# Additional example
sentence3 = ""a prime example""
print(words_in_sentence(sentence3))  # Output: ""prime"" (since ""prime"" has length 5, which is prime)
```

This code is efficient for the given constraints (sentence length up to 100) and ensures the output matches the requirements. If you have any further questions or need modifications, let me know!",0.0110948,17.663231134414673,0,0,MajorityVoting-k3,,
humaneval,HumanEval/134,MV-3,1,"The function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` needs to determine two things about the last character of a given string `txt`:
1.  Is it an alphabetical character?
2.  Is it *not* part of a word (meaning it's either the only character in the string, or it's preceded by a space)?

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1.  **Handle empty string:** If the input string `txt` is empty, there is no last character, so it cannot fulfill the conditions. In this case, return `False`.

2.  **Get the last character:** Access the last character of the string using `txt[-1]`.

3.  **Check if alphabetical:** Use the `isalpha()` string method to determine if the last character is a letter. If it's not, return `False`.

4.  **Check ""not part of a word"" condition:** This is the core of the problem. A character is considered ""not part of a word"" if:
    *   The string has only one character (e.g., ""a""). In this case, that single character stands alone.
    *   The character immediately preceding the last character is a space (e.g., ""hello w"").

    We can combine these two checks:
    *   If `len(txt) == 1`, the condition is met.
    *   If `len(txt) > 1`, we need to check `txt[-2] == ' '`.

    If either of these sub-conditions is true, along with the first three checks, then the function should return `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This logic can be elegantly combined into a single return statement after initial checks.

```python
def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):
    """"""
    Create a function that returns True if the last character
    of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not
    a part of a word, and False otherwise.
    Note: ""word"" is a group of characters separated by space.

    Examples:
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(""apple pie"") ➞ False
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(""apple pi e"") ➞ True
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(""apple pi e "") ➞ False
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("""") ➞ False 
    """"""
    # 1. Handle empty string: If the string is empty, it cannot satisfy the conditions.
    if not txt:
        return False

    last_char = txt[-1]

    # 2. Check if the last character is alphabetical.
    if not last_char.isalpha():
        return False

    # 3. Check if the last character is not part of a word.
    # This condition is met if:
    #   a) The string has only one character (e.g., ""a"")
    #   b) The character immediately before the last one is a space (e.g., ""apple pi e"")

    # If the string has only one character, it means it's a letter by itself.
    if len(txt) == 1:
        return True
    
    # If the string has more than one character, check the second to last character.
    # If it's a space, the last character is not part of a preceding word.
    # Note: txt[-2] is safe here because we've already checked len(txt) == 1.
    return txt[-2] == ' '

humaneval,HumanEval/42,MV-3,1,"It looks like you're providing a function stub for `incr_list` and want me to complete it based on the description in the docstring. I'll write the full, executable Python code for this function.

Here's the completed function:

```python
def incr_list(l: list):
    """"""Return a new list with each element incremented by 1.
    
    >>> incr_list([1, 2, 3])
    [2, 3, 4]
    >>> incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])
    [6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]
    """"""
    # Create a new list by adding 1 to each element in the input list
    return [x + 1 for x in l]
```

### Explanation:
- This implementation uses a list comprehension, which is a clean and efficient way to generate a new list.
- It iterates over each element `x` in the input list `l` and adds 1 to it.
- The function returns a new list without modifying the original list, ensuring it's pure and side-effect-free.
- It works for lists of numbers (integers or floats) but assumes the input contains elements that can be incremented (e.g., numbers). If the list contains non-numeric elements, it will raise a TypeError.

You can test this function in a Python environment. For example:

```python
print(incr_list([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: [2, 3, 4]
print(incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]))  # Output: [6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]
print(incr_list([]))  # Output: []  (empty list)
print(incr_list([-1, 0, 1]))  # Output: [0, 1, 2]

humaneval,HumanEval/158,MV-3,1,"The problem asks us to find a word from a list of strings that has the maximum number of unique characters. If there's a tie in the number of unique characters, we should return the word that comes first lexicographically.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1.  **Handle Empty List:** First, consider the edge case where the input list `words` might be empty. In such a scenario, it's reasonable to return an empty string or `None`. For this problem, an empty string seems appropriate given the return type of string.

2.  **Initialization:**
    *   Initialize `best_word` to the first word in the list.
    *   Initialize `max_unique_chars` to the count of unique characters in the first word. We can get the count of unique characters by converting the word to a `set` and then taking its length (`len(set(word))`).

3.  **Iterate and Compare:**
    *   Loop through the rest of the words in the list (starting from the second word).
    *   For each `current_word`:
        *   Calculate `current_unique_chars = len(set(current_word))`.
        *   **Comparison Logic:**
            *   **If `current_unique_chars` is greater than `max_unique_chars`**: This `current_word` is a new best candidate. Update `max_unique_chars` to `current_unique_chars` and `best_word` to `current_word`.
            *   **If `current_unique_chars` is equal to `max_unique_chars`**: This is a tie in unique character count. Apply the lexicographical tie-breaking rule. If `current_word` comes before `best_word` lexicographically (i.e., `current_word < best_word`), then update `best_word` to `current_word`.

4.  **Return:** After iterating through all words, `best_word` will hold the word that satisfies all conditions. Return `best_word`.
