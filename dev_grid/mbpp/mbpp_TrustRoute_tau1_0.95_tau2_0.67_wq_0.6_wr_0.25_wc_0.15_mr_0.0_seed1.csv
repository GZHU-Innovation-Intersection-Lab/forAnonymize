mbpp,Mbpp/235,TrustRoute,1,"The problem statement ""set all even bits of a given number"" typically implies turning the bits at even positions (0, 2, 4, ...) to 1. However, the provided assert `even_bit_set_number(10) == 10` contradicts this standard interpretation.

Let's analyze `n = 10` in binary: `...01010`.
Bit positions (right to left, starting from 0):
- Bit 0 (even): 0
- Bit 1 (odd): 1
- Bit 2 (even): 0
- Bit 3 (odd): 1

If ""set all even bits"" meant turning them to 1:
- Bit 0 would change from 0 to 1.
- Bit 2 would change from 0 to 1.
The resulting number would be `...01111` (binary), which is 15. This is not 10.

To obtain `10` from `10` by manipulating even bits, the even bits (0 and 2) must remain 0. This implies the operation is not ""set to 1"" but rather ""set to 0"" (i.e., clear) for even bits, while odd bits remain unchanged.

Therefore, we interpret the function's goal as: ""clear all even-positioned bits of the given number"".
This can be achieved by performing a bitwise AND operation between the number `n` and a mask that has 1s at all odd bit positions and 0s at all even bit positions.

```python
def even_bit_set_number(n: int) -> int:
    mask = 0
    # Iterate through bit positions up to the most significant bit of n.
    # n.bit_length() returns the number of bits required to represent n,
    # excluding the sign and leading zeros. For n=10 (1010_2), it's 4.
    # The loop will consider positions 0, 1, 2, 3.
    for i in range(n.bit_length()):
        # If the current bit position 'i' is odd, set that bit in the mask.
        # This constructs a mask with 1s at odd positions (e.g., 0...1010_2).
        if i % 2 != 0:
            mask |= (1 << i)
    
    # Perform a bitwise AND operation. This will keep the bits of 'n' that are at
    # odd positions (where mask has 1) and will clear (set to 0) the bits of 'n'
    # that are at even positions (where mask has 0).
