1. **Calculate the total number of eggs laid per day**: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.

2. **Determine how many eggs she consumes**:
   - She eats 3 eggs for breakfast.
   - She uses 4 eggs for baking muffins.
   - Total eggs consumed = 3 + 4 = 7 eggs.

3. **Calculate the number of eggs remaining for sale**:
   - Eggs remaining = Total eggs laid - Eggs consumed
   - Eggs remaining = 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

4. **Determine the revenue from selling the remaining eggs**:
   - Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 per egg.
   - Total revenue = Number of eggs sold × Price per egg
   - Total revenue = 9 × 2 = $18.

1. **Calculate the total investment**: This includes the purchase price of the house and the cost of repairs.
   \[
   \text{Total Investment} = \text{Purchase Price} + \text{Repair Costs} = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the increased value of the house**: Since the value of the house increased by 150%, we first need to find out what 150% of the original purchase price is.
   \[
   \text{Increase in Value} = \text{Purchase Price} \times 150\% = 80,000 \times 1.5 = 120,000
   \]
   Now, we add this increase to the original purchase price to find the new value of the house.
   \[
   \text{New Value of the House} = \text{Purchase Price} + \text{Increase in Value} = 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the profit**: Profit is calculated by subtracting the total investment from the new value of the house.
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{New Value of the House} - \text{Total Investment} = 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000

gsm8k,gsm8k-29,TrustRoute,1,"Let me reason through this problem step by step to determine the cost of the boots.

### Step 1: Identify the costs of the high heels
- One pair of high heels costs $33.
- The other pair costs twice as much as the first pair, so its cost is \(2 \times 33 = 66\) dollars.

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the two pairs of high heels
- The total cost of the two pairs is \(33 + 66 = 99\) dollars.

### Step 3: Relate the total cost to the boots
- The problem states that the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots.
- Let the cost of the boots be \(C\) dollars.
- This gives us the equation: \(99 = C - 5\).

### Step 4: Solve for the cost of the boots
- Rearrange the equation: \(C = 99 + 5 = 104\).

### Step 1: Understand the ratio
- The ages of Darrell and Allen are in the ratio 7:11.
- This means if Darrell's age is 7x (where x is a common multiplier), then Allen's age is 11x.

### Step 2: Use the total age
- Their total age now is 162.

The total number of coins is given by:
\[
G + S = 110
\]

Substitute \(G = S + 30\) into the equation:

1. **Determine Dana's skipping speed**: 
   - We know that Dana can skip at a speed of 3 miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's running speed**: 
   - Since her skipping speed is half of her running speed, we can calculate her running speed as follows:
   \[
   \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 \text{ mph} = 6 \text{ mph}
   \]

3. **Determine Dana's walking speed**: 
   - Dana's running speed is four times her walking speed. Therefore, we can find her walking speed:
   \[
   \text{Walking speed} = \frac{\text{Running speed}}{4} = \frac{6 \text{ mph}}{4} = 1.5 \text{ mph}
   \]

4. **Calculate the time spent running and walking**: 
   - Dana spends one-third of her time running and two-thirds of her time walking over a total of 6 hours.
   - Time spent running:
   \[
   \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]
   - Time spent walking:
   \[
   \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours}
   \]

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while running and walking**:
   - Distance traveled while running:
   \[
   \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 6 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles}

**Given information:**
- Bridge weight limit: 5000 pounds
- Weight of each box: 15 pounds
- Weight of driver + empty truck: 3755 pounds

**Step-by-step solution:**

1) First, I'll find how much weight capacity is available for boxes:
   - Available capacity = Bridge limit - (Driver + Empty truck)
   - Available capacity = 5000 - 3755
   - Available capacity = 1245 pounds

gsm8k,gsm8k-62,TrustRoute,1,"To determine Marcy's annual pension after quitting at 30 years, let's break this down step by step based on the information provided:

### Step 1: Understand the pension rules
- The full annual pension is $50,000 if Marcy works for 40 years.
- Starting after 20 years of service, she becomes entitled to 5% of the full pension value ($50,000) for each additional year worked.
- 5% of the full pension value is calculated as:  
  \( 0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500 \).  
  So, for each year beyond 20 years, she earns $2,500 toward her annual pension.

### Step 2: Calculate the years beyond 20
- Marcy quits after 30 years.
- Years beyond 20 years: \( 30 - 20 = 10 \) years.

### Step 3: Compute the annual pension
- For each of these 10 years, she earns 5% of the full pension:  
  \( 10 \times 2,500 = 25,000 \).
- Therefore, her annual pension is $25,000.

- The team played a total of 22 games.
- Let \( L \) represent the number of games they lost.
- Let \( W \) represent the number of games they won.
- According to the problem, they won 8 more games than they lost, so \( W = L + 8 \).
- Assuming all games resulted in either a win or a loss (no ties, as the problem doesn't mention them), the total games can be expressed as \( W + L = 22 \).

Substitute the equation for \( W \) into the total games equation:  
\( (L + 8) + L = 22 \)  
\( 2L + 8 = 22 \)  
\( 2L = 14 \)  
\( L = 7 \)

Now, substitute \( L = 7 \) back into the equation for \( W \):  
\( W = 7 + 8 = 15 \)

Let me break this down step by step:

**Initial Information:**
- Starting monthly salary: $600
- Salary increase: 10% of initial salary per year
- Increase applies to: employees who've stayed 5+ years
- Sylvie just completed: 5 years
- Find salary after: 3 more years (at 8 years total)

**Step 1: Determine when increases apply**
Sylvie just clocked 5 years, so she becomes eligible for the 10% annual increase starting now.

**Step 2: Calculate the yearly increases**
The increase is 10% of the **initial salary** each year (not compounding).
- 10% of $600 = $60 per year increase

**Step 3: Calculate increases over 3 more years**
- After year 5 (now): $600/month
- After year 6: $600 + $60 = $660/month
- After year 7: $660 + $60 = $720/month
- After year 8: $720 + $60 = $780/month

**Step 4: Calculate annual salary after 3 more years**

According to the problem, we know the following:

1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
2. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.

From the information given, we can express the relationship between the number of photographs that Jamal's and Brittany's phones can hold:

- Let \( B \) be the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold.
- Since Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, we have:
  \[
  1800 = 6B
  \]
  To find \( B \), we can rearrange this equation:
  \[
  B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300
  \]

Now we know that Brittany's phone can hold a maximum of 300 photographs.

Next, we know that Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph:
\[
B = 50b
\]
Substituting the value of \( B \) we found:
\[
300 = 50b
\]
To find \( b \), we can rearrange this equation:
\[
b = \frac{300}{50} = 6

**Step 2: Set up the problem**
- Let the common multiplier be x
- Teaspoons of sugar = 7x

**Given information:**
- Adrien's salary 4 years ago: $40,000
- Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's (4 years ago)
- Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%
- Both salaries increased simultaneously (by the same percentage)

**Step 1: Find Lylah's salary 4 years ago**

If Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's:
- Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary × 1.30
- $40,000 = Lylah's salary × 1.30
- Lylah's salary = $40,000 ÷ 1.30
- Lylah's salary = $30,769.23 (approximately)

**Step 2: Find Adrien's salary four years later**

Adrien's new salary = $40,000 × 1.40 = $56,000

**Step 3: Find the percentage increase**

Since both salaries increased simultaneously (by the same percentage):
- Percentage increase = 40%

**Step 4: Find Lylah's salary four years later**

Lylah's new salary = $30,769.23 × 1.40 = $43,076.92 (approximately)

**Step 5: Calculate total salary four years later**

Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
Total salary = $56,000 + $43,076.92
Total salary = $99,076.92

**Answer: $99,076.92** (or approximately $99,077)

If we want an exact answer using fractions:
- Lylah's original salary = 40,000/1.3 = 400,000/13
- Lylah's new salary = (400,000/13) × 1.4 = 560,000/13

4.  **Total Time:** 36 months

First, calculate how many times the price will increase:
Number of increase periods = Total months / Months per increase = 36 months / 2 months = 18 periods

Now, apply the compound interest formula:
Final Cost = Initial Cost * (1 + Rate of Increase)^Number of Periods
Final Cost = $20 * (1 + 0.20)^18
Final Cost = $20 * (1.20)^18

Using a calculator:
(1.20)^18 is approximately 27.807869
Final Cost = $20 * 27.807869
Final Cost = $556.15738

Rounding to two decimal places for currency:
Final Cost = $556.16

After 36 months, a bag of marbles would cost approximately **$556.16**.",0.004971530000000001,17.898006439208984,0,0,cand-gemini-2.5-flash,stage2_confidence,

   \]

2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28:
   \[

Now, we can simplify the second equation:
\[
S + B + 4 = 28

Subtracting 4 from both sides gives:
\[

Now we have a system of equations:
1. \( S = 2B \)
2. \( S + B = 24 \)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation. Replacing \( S \) with \( 2B \) in the second equation:

This simplifies to:
\[
3B = 24

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**
   The numbers on a six-sided die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes.

   \[
   P(\text{greater than 3}) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5

   To express this as a percentage:

2. **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**
   The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers.

   The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:
   \[
   P(\text{even on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]

   The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also:
   \[
   P(\text{even on second roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]

   Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
   \[
   P(\text{two evens}) = P(\text{even on first roll}) \times P(\text{even on second roll}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25

gsm8k,gsm8k-187,TrustRoute,1,"To calculate how much Mandy owes Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can use the formula for compound interest:

\[
A = P(1 + r)^n
\]

Where:
- \( A \) is the amount owed after \( n \) months,
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial amount owed),
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (as a decimal),
- \( n \) is the number of months.

In this case:
- \( P = 100 \) (the initial amount),
- \( r = 0.02 \) (2% as a decimal),
- \( n = 3 \) (the number of months).

Now we can substitute the values into the formula:

\[
A = 100(1 + 0.02)^3
\]

Calculating \( (1 + 0.02)^3 \):

\[
1 + 0.02 = 1.02

gsm8k,gsm8k-188,TrustRoute,1,"To find out how many bags the trader sold, we can set up the problem step by step.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of bags the trader bought and sold.

2. **Calculate Costs**:
   - The cost of buying the wheat bags: \( 20x \) (since each bag costs $20).
   - The cost of transporting the bags: \( 2x \) (since it costs $2 to transport each bag).
   - Therefore, the total cost for the trader is:
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = 20x + 2x = 22x
     \]

3. **Calculate Revenue**:
   - The revenue from selling the bags at $30 each: \( 30x \).

4. **Calculate Profit**:
   - Profit is defined as Revenue - Total Cost. According to the problem, the trader made a total profit of $400:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Total Cost}
     \]
     Substituting the expressions we have:
     \[
     400 = 30x - 22x
     \]
     Simplifying this gives:

5. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - To find \( x \), divide both sides by 8:
