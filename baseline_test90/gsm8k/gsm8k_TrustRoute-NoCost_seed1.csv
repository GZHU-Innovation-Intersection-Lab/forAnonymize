gsm8k,gsm8k-201,TrustRoute-NoCost,1,"To calculate how much money John made that year, we need to consider both the monetary award and the increase in his salary due to the raise.

1. **Calculate the total salary before the raise:**
   - John makes $2000 a week.
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - Total salary for the year before the raise = $2000/week * 52 weeks = $104,000.

2. **Calculate the raise:**
   - John receives a 5% raise on his weekly salary.
   - 5% of $2000 = 0.05 * $2000 = $100.

gsm8k,gsm8k-205,TrustRoute-NoCost,1,"To find out what score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after dropping the lowest score, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total score needed for an average of 93**:
   Since the lowest score will be dropped, we will be averaging the top 5 scores. To find the total score needed for an average of 93 over 5 tests, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Total needed} = \text{Average} \times \text{Number of tests}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total needed} = 93 \times 5 = 465
   \]

2. **Calculate the sum of the first five test scores**:
   Brinley's scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. We first calculate the sum of these scores:
   \[
   \text{Sum of scores} = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438
   \]

3. **Determine the score needed on the sixth test**:
   Let \( x \) be the score Brinley needs on her sixth test. After dropping the lowest score, the sum of the highest 5 scores (including the sixth test score) must equal 465. The lowest score among her first five tests is 71, so we can set up the equation:

gsm8k,gsm8k-207,TrustRoute-NoCost,1,"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately, then sum them up.

1. **Weight of Chocolate Bars:**
   - There are 25 chocolate bars.
   - Each chocolate bar weighs 40g.
   - Total weight of chocolate bars = Number of chocolate bars × Weight of each chocolate bar
   \[
   \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{g}
   \]

2. **Weight of Candied Apples:**
   - There are 80 candied apples.
   - Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, we can find the weight of each candied apple.
   - Weight of each candied apple = Weight of each chocolate bar / 2
   \[
   \text{Weight of each candied apple} = 40 \text{g} / 2 = 20 \text{g}
   \]
   - Total weight of candied apples = Number of candied apples × Weight of each candied apple

   - Therefore, the total cost of 3 plates is:
     \[
     3 \text{ plates} \times 6000 \text{ dollars/plate} = 18000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups**:
   - We know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of the 3 plates.
   - Thus, the cost of twenty dozen cups is:
     \[
     18000 \text{ dollars} - 1200 \text{ dollars} = 16800 \text{ dollars}

gsm8k,gsm8k-211,TrustRoute-NoCost,1,"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \).

From the problem, we know two things:

1. The total number of eggs produced by the chickens is 42:
   \[
   3r + 5w = 42
   \]

2. There are two more white chickens than red chickens:
   \[
   w = r + 2
   \]

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation. Replacing \( w \) in the first equation gives us:
\[
3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
\]

Now, simplify the equation:
\[
3r + 5r + 10 = 42
\]
\[
8r + 10 = 42

3. **Billy Takes Fries**: Billy takes twice as many fries as Kyle. Since Kyle took 5 fries, Billy takes:
   \[
   \text{Fries taken by Billy} = 2 \times 5 = 10

   Now, Griffin has:
   \[
   \text{Fries left with Griffin} = 19 - 10 = 9

1. **Time to heat oil to 300 degrees**: This is given as 20 minutes.

2. **Time to heat oil from 300 degrees to 400 degrees**: 
   - It takes 40% longer than the time taken to heat to 300 degrees.
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \(0.4 \times 20 = 8\) minutes.
   - Therefore, the time to heat from 300 degrees to 400 degrees is \(20 + 8 = 28\) minutes.

3. **Total time to heat oil to 400 degrees**:
   - This is the sum of the time to heat to 300 degrees and the time to heat from 300 to 400 degrees:
   \[
   20 \text{ minutes} + 28 \text{ minutes} = 48 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Time to cook the chicken**:
   - It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil.
   - Since it took 48 minutes to warm up the oil, the cooking time is:
   \[
   48 \text{ minutes} - 5 \text{ minutes} = 43 \text{ minutes}

   \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
   \[
   R + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

Substituting \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
\]

Now, simplify the right side:
\[
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Next, we can isolate \( S \) by moving \( 3S \) to the left side:
\[
6S - 3S + 9 = 27

1. **Total Budget**: Theo has $6000.

2. **Expenses**:
   - **Business Suits**: He buys 6 suits at $100 each.
     \[
     \text{Cost of suits} = 6 \times 100 = 600
     \]
   - **Suitcases**: He buys 3 suitcases at $50 each.
     \[
     \text{Cost of suitcases} = 3 \times 50 = 150

1. **Determine Noah's current age**:
   - We know that Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old six years ago.
   - Therefore, Noah's current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

2. **Calculate the population of Chile six years ago**:
   - The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

3. **Determine the current population of Chile**:
   - The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now.
   - Let \(P\) be the current population of Chile. According to the information given:
   \[
   \frac{P}{2} = 60000

gsm8k,gsm8k-314,TrustRoute-NoCost,1,"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( d \).

According to the problem:

1. The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so the number of offensive players is \( 2d \).
2. The number of players on special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the number of special teams players is \( \frac{d}{2} \).

Now, we can set up an equation based on the total number of team members:

\[
d + 2d + \frac{d}{2} = 105
\]

Combining the terms on the left side:

\[
3d + \frac{d}{2} = 105
\]

To combine \( 3d \) and \( \frac{d}{2} \), we can convert \( 3d \) into a fraction with a denominator of 2:

\[
3d = \frac{6d}{2}
\]

Now, substituting this into the equation gives:

\[
\frac{6d}{2} + \frac{d}{2} = 105
\]

Combining the fractions:

\[
\frac{6d + d}{2} = 105
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{7d}{2} = 105
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 2:

\[

\]

Now, divide by 7:

\[
d = 30
\]

Thus, the number of players on the defense is \( \boxed{30} \). 

To verify:
- Offense: \( 2d = 2 \times 30 = 60 \)
- Special Teams: \( \frac{d}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \)

Adding these together:

gsm8k,gsm8k-380,TrustRoute-NoCost,1,"To calculate the monthly payment Karan has to make, we can use the formula for the monthly payment on an installment loan, which includes both principal and interest. The formula for the monthly payment \( M \) is given by:

\[
M = \frac{P \cdot r(1 + r)^n}{(1 + r)^n - 1}
\]

Where:
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the amount borrowed),
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (annual interest rate divided by 12),
- \( n \) is the number of payments (months).

Given:
- \( P = 3650 \)
- Annual interest rate = 10%, so the monthly interest rate \( r = \frac{10\%}{12} = \frac{0.10}{12} \approx 0.0083333 \)
- \( n = 5 \) months

Now, we can substitute these values into the formula:

1. Calculate \( r \):
   \[
   r = \frac{0.10}{12} \approx 0.0083333
   \]

2. Substitute \( P \), \( r \), and \( n \) into the formula:

1. **Calculate the total number of spaces in the shelving system**: 
   The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns. Therefore, the total number of spaces is:
   \[
   6 \times 6 = 36
   \]

2. **Define the number of books**: 
   Let \( x \) be the number of books Wendy currently has. According to the problem, she wants to place 20 more than double the number of books she has. This can be expressed mathematically as:
   \[
   2x + 20
   \]

3. **Set up the equation**: 
   Wendy wants to fill the shelving system completely, which means she wants to have as many books as there are spaces:
   \[
   2x + 20 = 36
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   First, subtract 20 from both sides:
   \[
   2x = 36 - 20
   \]
   \[
   2x = 16
   \]

According to the problem, we have the following information:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- She gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
- Therefore, the total number of apples Joanne gathers is:
  \[
  30 + 15 + x = 45 + x
  \]

Now, let's analyze what her sister gathers:

- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- She gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- Her sister does not gather any apples from the average trees.

Thus, the total number of apples her sister gathers is:
\[
60 + 45 = 105
\]

Now, we can set up the equation for the combined total of apples gathered by both sisters:
\[
(45 + x) + 105 = 500

gsm8k,gsm8k-416,TrustRoute-NoCost,1,"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let:
- \( c \) = number of camels
- \( d \) = number of dromedaries

From the problem, we know:
1. Each animal has one head, so the total number of heads gives us the equation:
   \[
   c + d = 180
   \]

2. Camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump. The total number of humps gives us the equation:
   \[
   2c + d = 304
   \]

Now we have the following system of equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)  (Equation 1)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \)  (Equation 2)

We can solve this system step by step.

First, we can solve Equation 1 for \( d \):
\[
d = 180 - c
\]

Next, we substitute \( d \) in Equation 2:
\[
2c + (180 - c) = 304
\]

Now simplify the equation:
\[
2c + 180 - c = 304
\]
\[
c + 180 = 304
\]
\[
c = 304 - 180
\]
\[
c = 124
\]

Now that we have \( c \), we can find \( d \) using Equation 1:
\[
d = 180 - c = 180 - 124 = 56

Thus, the number of dromedaries is:

gsm8k,gsm8k-417,TrustRoute-NoCost,1,"To calculate the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week trip, we can break it down into parts based on the information provided.

1. **Distance traveled in the first 4 days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day for 4 days.
   - Distance for the first 4 days = \( 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \).

2. **Distance traveled in the next 2 days:**
   - He traveled a total of 30% of the distance traveled in the first 4 days over the next 2 days.
   - 30% of 800 km = \( 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \).
   - Therefore, the total distance for the next 2 days = 240 km.

3. **Distance traveled on the next day:**
   - On the next day, he did not travel at all, so the distance is 0 km.

4. **Distance traveled in the second week (the last 7 days):**
   - During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days.
   - Distance for the second week = \( 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \).

5. **Total distance traveled:**
   - Now, we can add all the distances together:

Let:
- \( A \) be the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( B \) be the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

From the problem, we have:
- \( |A| = 9 \) (kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |B| = 6 \) (kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |A \cap B| = 3 \) (kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

Using the inclusion-exclusion principle, the total number of kids allergic to at least one of the allergens is given by:

\[
|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|

   - Total cost for plane tickets = 2 * $5000 = $10,000

2. **Cost of Hotel:**
   - Normal price of the hotel per day = $1500
   - Since the hotel is 20% more expensive due to the busy weekend, we need to calculate the increased price:

gsm8k,gsm8k-500,TrustRoute-NoCost,1,"Let's denote the number of insects found by Lily as \( L \), the number found by David as \( D \), and the number found by Bodhi as \( B \).

From the problem, we have the following equations:

1. \( L + D + B = 43 \) (the total number of insects)
2. \( L = D + 7 \) (Lily found 7 more than David)
3. \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \) (David found half of what Bodhi found)

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( L \) and \( D \) into the first equation.

First, substitute \( D \) from equation 3 into equation 2:

\[
L = \frac{1}{2}B + 7
\]

Now substitute \( L \) and \( D \) into equation 1:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}B + 7\right) + \left(\frac{1}{2}B\right) + B = 43
\]

Combine the terms:

\[
\frac{1}{2}B + 7 + \frac{1}{2}B + B = 43
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2B + 7 = 43
\]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[
2B = 36
\]

Now, divide by 2:

\[
B = 18
\]

Now that we have \( B \), we can find \( D \):

\[
D = \frac{1}{2}B = \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9
\]

Finally, we can find \( L \):

\[
L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16
\]

Thus, the number of insects that Lily found is \( \boxed{16} \).",0.00025485,4.772029161453247,,True

4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does.

Now, let's analyze the information step by step:

- **Cows:**
  - The farm has 30 cows.
  - The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so:
    \[
    \text{Cows in the zoo} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ cows}

1. **Tony's Picking Rate**: 
   - Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

2. **Bobby's Picking Rate**: 
   - Bobby picks one less quart than Tony. 
   - Therefore, Bobby's rate is \( 6 - 1 = 5 \) quarts per hour.

3. **Kathy's Picking Rate**: 
   - Kathy picks twice as many strawberries as Bobby. 
   - Therefore, Kathy's rate is \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) quarts per hour.

4. **Ricky's Picking Rate**: 
   - Ricky picks two fewer quarts than Kathy. 
   - Therefore, Ricky's rate is \( 10 - 2 = 8 \) quarts per hour.

5. **Total Picking Rate**: 
   - Now, we can sum the rates of all four individuals:

   - She reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she reads in 105 minutes, we first determine how many 1.5-minute intervals fit into 105 minutes:
     \[
     \text{Number of intervals} = \frac{105 \text{ minutes}}{1.5 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 70 \text{ intervals}

   - Since she reads 2 pages per interval, the total number of pages read in the first week is:
     \[
     \text{Pages read in first week} = 70 \text{ intervals} × 2 \text{ pages/interval} = 140 \text{ pages}
     \]

2. **Second Week:**
   - Judy read a total of 100 pages.

3. **Total Pages Read in Two Weeks:**
   - Now, we add the pages read in both weeks:
     \[

- The number of red jelly beans \( r \) is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans:
  \[
  r = b - 0.01b = 0.99b
  \]

- The number of green jelly beans \( g \) is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans:
  \[
  g = b + 0.01b = 1.01b
  \]

The total number of jelly beans in the jar is given as 4500. Therefore, we can express the total number of jelly beans in terms of \( b \):
\[
r + b + g = 4500
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( r \) and \( g \) into the total:
\[

gsm8k,gsm8k-606,TrustRoute-NoCost,1,"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of rotations Jeremy's tires undergo in a month.**
   - Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.
   - The car's tires rotate 725 times for every 2 miles.
   - First, we need to find out how many 2-mile segments are in 400 miles:
     \[
     \text{Number of 2-mile segments} = \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/segment}} = 200 \text{ segments}
     \]
   - Now, we can calculate the total rotations in a month:
     \[
     \text{Total rotations in a month} = 200 \text{ segments} \times 725 \text{ rotations/segment} = 145,000 \text{ rotations}
     \]

2. **Calculate how many months it takes for the tires to reach their maximum rotation limit.**
   - Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations.
   - We can find out how many months it will take to reach this limit:
     \[
     \text{Months until replacement} = \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{145,000 \text{ rotations/month}} \approx 72.1 \text{ months}

1. **Determine the total number of washes Jackie can get from the jumbo bottle**:
   - The directions say that 2 pumps give 120 washes. 
   - Therefore, 1 pump will give half of that:
     \[
     \text{Washes per pump} = \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washes per pump}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of washes Jackie can get from the entire bottle**:
   - Since Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, she will get 120 washes from the jumbo bottle.

3. **Calculate the cost per wash**:
   - The total cost of the jumbo bottle is $24.00. To find the cost per wash, we divide the total cost by the total number of washes:
     \[
     \text{Cost per wash} = \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washes}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per wash}

gsm8k,gsm8k-611,TrustRoute-NoCost,1,"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial funding for the first 5 months and the funding for the additional months.

1. **Initial Funding for the First 5 Months:**
   - The initial funding is $100,000 for the first 5 months.
   - Total cost for the first 5 months = $100,000.

2. **Duration of Research:**
   - John’s research took 10 times longer than initially planned.
   - Therefore, the total duration of the research = 10 * 5 months = 50 months.

3. **Additional Months of Research:**
   - The additional months after the first 5 months = 50 months - 5 months = 45 months.

4. **Funding for Additional Months:**
   - The funding for each month after the first 5 months increases by 50% compared to the previous month.
   - The funding for the 6th month is 50% more than the funding for the 5th month. Since the funding for the first 5 months is $100,000, we can assume that the funding for each of these months is \( \frac{100,000}{5} = 20,000 \).
   - Thus, the funding for the 5th month is $20,000.

   Now, we can calculate the funding for the subsequent months:
   - 6th month: \( 20,000 \times 1.5 = 30,000 \)
   - 7th month: \( 30,000 \times 1.5 = 45,000 \)
   - 8th month: \( 45,000 \times 1.5 = 67,500 \)
   - 9th month: \( 67,500 \times 1.5 = 101,250 \)
   - 10th month: \( 101,250 \times 1.5 = 151,875 \)
   - And so on...

   This forms a geometric series where the first term \( a = 30,000 \) (the funding for the 6th month) and the common ratio \( r = 1.5 \).

   The funding for the \( n \)-th month can be expressed as:
   \[
   a_n = a \cdot r^{(n-1)}
   \]

   The total funding for the additional 45 months can be calculated using the formula for the sum of a geometric series:
   \[
   S_n = a \frac{(1 - r^n)}{(1 - r)}
   \]
   where \( n \) is the number of terms.

   Here, \( a = 30,000 \), \( r = 1.5 \), and \( n = 45 \):
   \[
   S_{45} = 30,000 \frac{(1 - (1.5)^{45})}{(1 - 1.5)}
   \]
   \[
   S_{45} = 30,000 \frac{(1 - (1.5)^{45})}{-0.5}
   \]
   \[
   S_{45} = -60,000 (1 - (1.5)^{45})
   \]

   Now, we need to calculate \( (1.5)^{45} \):
   \[
   (1.5)^{45} \approx 7.62939453125 \times 10^{7}
   \]

   Therefore:
   \[
   S_{45} \approx -60,000 (1 - 7.62939453125 \times 10^{7}) \approx -60,000 (-7.62939453125 \times 10^{7}) \approx 4.57763671875 \times 10^{9}
   \]

5. **Total Cost of Research:**
   - Total cost = Initial funding + Additional funding
   - Total cost = $100,000 + $4.57763671875 \times 10^{9} \approx 4,577,736.71875

gsm8k,gsm8k-635,TrustRoute-NoCost,1,"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum total cost per class that they are willing to accept.

1. **Total Cost of Classes**: Manny signed up for classes that cost $60 in total.
2. **Total Number of Classes**: There are 10 classes in total.
3. **Maximum Cost per Class**: His parents will not sign him up again if the cost exceeds $10 per class.

Now, let's calculate the maximum total cost that would keep the cost per class at or below $10:

\[
\text{Maximum Total Cost} = \text{Maximum Cost per Class} \times \text{Total Number of Classes}
\]
\[
\text{Maximum Total Cost} = 10 \times 10 = 100
\]

Since Manny's total cost is $60, we need to find out how many classes he can miss while keeping the average cost per class at or below $10.

Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny misses. The number of classes he actually attends will then be \( 10 - x \).

The total cost per class if he misses \( x \) classes is given by:

\[
\text{Cost per Class} = \frac{\text{Total Cost}}{\text{Number of Classes Attended}} = \frac{60}{10 - x}
\]

We want this cost to be less than or equal to $10:

\[
\frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10
\]

Now, we can solve this inequality:

1. Multiply both sides by \( 10 - x \) (assuming \( 10 - x > 0 \)):
   \[
   60 \leq 10(10 - x)
   \]
   \[
   60 \leq 100 - 10x
   \]

2. Rearranging gives:
   \[
   10x \leq 100 - 60
   \]
   \[
   10x \leq 40
   \]
   \[
   x \leq 4
   \]

Thus, Manny can miss up to 4 classes. If he misses 4 classes, he will attend 6 classes, and the cost per class will be:

\[
\text{Cost per Class} = \frac{60}{6} = 10
\]

If he misses 5 classes, he will attend only 5 classes, and the cost per class will be:

\[
\text{Cost per Class} = \frac{60}{5} = 12
\]

Since $12 exceeds $10, he cannot miss 5 classes.

Therefore, the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again is **4 classes**.",0.0003743999999999,6.571274518966675,,True

Let:
- \( s \) = number of sheep
- \( g \) = number of geese

We know the following:
1. Each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs.
2. Each animal has 1 head.

From the problem, we can derive the following equations:

1. The total number of legs:
   \[
   4s + 2g = 70
   \]

2. The total number of heads:
   \[
   s + g = 20
   \]

Now we can solve this system of equations.

First, we can solve the second equation for \( g \):
\[
g = 20 - s
\]

Next, we substitute \( g \) in the first equation:
\[
4s + 2(20 - s) = 70
\]

Expanding this gives:
\[
4s + 40 - 2s = 70

- Let \( M \) be the number of cookies Max has.
- Let \( C \) be the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of cookies Summer has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. \( K = M - 5 \) (Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max)
2. \( M = C + 12 \) (Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster)
3. \( S = M + 23 \) (Summer has 23 more cookies than Max)
4. \( K = 68 \) (Katarina has 68 cookies)

Now, we can substitute \( K \) into the first equation:

\[
68 = M - 5
\]

Adding 5 to both sides gives:

\[
M = 68 + 5 = 73
\]

Now that we have \( M \), we can find \( C \) using the second equation:

\[
M = C + 12 \implies 73 = C + 12
\]

Subtracting 12 from both sides gives:

\[
C = 73 - 12 = 61

Next, we can find \( S \) using the third equation:

\[
S = M + 23 \implies S = 73 + 23 = 96

Next, we calculate how long it takes him to mow half of the lawn in each mode.

3. **Mowing Half the Lawn in Turtle Mode**:
   - Since half the lawn is \( \frac{1}{2} \) lawn, the time taken in turtle mode is:
   \[
   \text{Time}_{\text{turtle}} = \frac{\text{Amount of lawn}}{\text{Rate}_{\text{turtle}}} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn}}{\frac{1}{60} \text{ lawns per minute}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ minutes}

2. The combined ages of the twins and triplets is 44:
   \[

3. Since the twins are the same age, we can say \( T_1 = T_2 \).

Let’s denote the age of the twins as \( T \) (so \( T_1 = T_2 = T \)) and the age of the triplets as \( R \) (so \( R_1 = R_2 = R_3 = R \)). 

Now we can rewrite the equations:

1. \( T = R + 7 \)
2. The combined age equation becomes:

   Simplifying this gives:

1. **Calculate the cost of the vaccines:**
   - John needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20.
   - Total cost of vaccines = 2 vaccines × $20/vaccine = $40.

2. **Let the total bill be \( x \).**  
   According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Therefore:
   - Cost of heartworm check = 0.60 × \( x \).

3. **The total bill can be expressed as:**
   \[
   x = \text{Cost of vaccines} + \text{Cost of heartworm check}
   \]
   Substituting the known values:

gsm8k,gsm8k-692,TrustRoute-NoCost,1,"To find the price of a crate of fruit, we first need to determine the individual prices of the fruits based on the information provided.

1. **Price of an apple**: 
   - Given: 1 apple costs $0.5.

2. **Price of a banana**: 
   - Since one banana costs twice as much as one apple:
   \[
   \text{Price of a banana} = 2 \times \text{Price of an apple} = 2 \times 0.5 = 1.0 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Price of an orange**: 
   - Since one orange costs three times as much as one banana:
   \[
   \text{Price of an orange} = 3 \times \text{Price of a banana} = 3 \times 1.0 = 3.0 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now we have the prices:
- Price of 1 apple = $0.5
- Price of 1 banana = $1.0
- Price of 1 orange = $3.0

Next, we calculate the total price for one crate, which consists of:
- 5 bananas
- 12 apples
- 7 oranges

Now we can calculate the total price for each type of fruit in the crate:

1. **Total price for bananas**:
   \[
   \text{Total price for bananas} = 5 \times \text{Price of a banana} = 5 \times 1.0 = 5.0 \text{ dollars}

   \[
   \text{Total price for oranges} = 7 \times \text{Price of an orange} = 7 \times 3.0 = 21.0 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Finally, we sum these amounts to find the total price for the crate:
\[
\text{Total price for the crate} = \text{Total price for bananas} + \text{Total price for apples} + \text{Total price for oranges}
\]
\[
\text{Total price for the crate} = 5.0 + 6.0 + 21.0 = 32.0 \text{ dollars}

   - The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
   - The rate of production for chocolate ice cream is:
     \[
     \text{Rate}_{\text{chocolate}} = \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour}
     \]

2. **Vanilla Ice Cream:**
   - The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
   - The rate of production for vanilla ice cream is:
     \[
     \text{Rate}_{\text{vanilla}} = \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour}

Now we can substitute \( x \) and \( z \) in terms of \( y \) into the total equation.

From the second equation, we can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):

Now substitute \( y \) and \( z \) into the total equation:

gsm8k,gsm8k-779,TrustRoute-NoCost,1,"To find the distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot, we can break down the problem into two parts: the driving distance and the hiking distance.

1. **Driving Information**:
   - Average driving speed = 50 miles per hour
   - Total time for the trip = 6 hours
   - Time spent hiking = 1.5 hours
   - Therefore, time spent driving = Total time - Hiking time = 6 hours - 1.5 hours = 4.5 hours

   Now, we can calculate the distance driven:
   \[
   \text{Distance driven} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4.5 \, \text{hours} = 225 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. **Hiking Information**:
   - The average hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half the driving speed.
   - Half the driving speed = \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \, \text{miles/hour} \)
   - Therefore, hiking speed = \( 25 - 5 = 20 \, \text{miles/hour} \)

   Now, we can calculate the distance hiked:
   \[
   \text{Distance hiked} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 20 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}

gsm8k,gsm8k-780,TrustRoute-NoCost,1,"To find the difference between Ava's and Emma's scores, we can set up the scoring based on the information provided.

Let's denote:
- \( e \): the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- \( b \): the number of berries Emma collects.
- \( t \): the time in seconds Emma has left when she finishes the level.

From the problem, we know:
- Ava jumps on \( e + 8 \) enemies.
- Ava collects \( b + 3 \) berries.
- Ava finishes the level \( t - 4 \) seconds slower than Emma, which means Ava has \( t - 4 \) seconds left.

Now we can calculate the scores for both players.

**Emma's score**:
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Emma}} = 10e + 5b + 30t
\]

**Ava's score**:
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10(e + 8) + 5(b + 3) + 30(t - 4)

Expanding Ava's score:
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10e + 80 + 5b + 15 + 30t - 120
\]
Combining like terms:
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10e + 5b + 30t - 25

gsm8k,gsm8k-783,TrustRoute-NoCost,1,"Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \( x \) and the number of white fish he bought as \( y \).

Initially, Bob had:
- 3 orange fish
- 4 white fish

After buying the fish, the total number of orange and white fish in the pond becomes:
- Orange fish: \( 3 + x \)
- White fish: \( 4 + y \)

According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob found that he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[
3 + x = 2(4 + y)
\]

We also know that Bob bought a total of 17 fish, so:

\[
x + y = 17
\]

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. \( 3 + x = 2(4 + y) \)
2. \( x + y = 17 \)

Let's solve the first equation:

\[
3 + x = 8 + 2y
\]
\[
x - 2y = 5 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]

Now, we can rewrite the second equation:

\[
x + y = 17 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\]

Now we can solve these equations. From Equation 2, we can express \( x \) in terms of \( y \):

\[
x = 17 - y
\]

Substituting this expression for \( x \) into Equation 1:

\[
(17 - y) - 2y = 5
\]
\[
17 - 3y = 5
\]
\[
-3y = 5 - 17
\]
\[
-3y = -12
\]
\[
y = 4
\]

Now that we have \( y \), we can find \( x \):

\[
x = 17 - y = 17 - 4 = 13
\]

Thus, Bob bought:
- \( x = 13 \) orange fish
- \( y = 4 \) white fish

Therefore, the number of white fish Bob bought at the store is \( \boxed{4} \).",0.00030315,5.015531539916992,,True

gsm8k,gsm8k-813,TrustRoute-NoCost,1,"To determine how many S'mores John and DeSean can make with the marshmallows left in the bag, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of marshmallows used:**
   - John makes 9 S'mores, using 9 marshmallows.
   - DeSean also makes 9 S'mores, using another 9 marshmallows.
   - They dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground.

   Total marshmallows used = Marshmallows used by John + Marshmallows used by DeSean + Marshmallows dropped
   \[
   \text{Total marshmallows used} = 9 + 9 + 3 = 21
   \]

2. **Calculate the remaining marshmallows:**
   - The bag originally has 35 marshmallows.
   - After using and dropping marshmallows, the remaining marshmallows can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Remaining marshmallows} = \text{Original marshmallows} - \text{Total marshmallows used}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining marshmallows} = 35 - 21 = 14
   \]

3. **Determine how many S'mores can be made with the remaining marshmallows:**
   - Each S'more requires 1 marshmallow.
   - Therefore, the number of S'mores that can be made with the remaining marshmallows is equal to the number of remaining marshmallows:
   \[
   \text{S'mores that can be made} = \text{Remaining marshmallows} = 14
   \]

4. **Distributing the remaining marshmallows:**
   - Since there are 14 marshmallows left, John and DeSean can each make S'mores with these marshmallows. If they decide to split them evenly:
   \[
   \text{S'mores each can have} = \frac{14}{2} = 7
   \]

Thus, each kid can have **7 S'mores** with the marshmallows left in the bag.",0.00028905,5.859776258468628,,True

1. **Jack's Playtime**:
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter.
   - In 4 hours (which is 240 minutes), the number of quarters Jack uses is:
     \[
     \text{Quarters used by Jack} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters}
     \]

2. **Friend 1's Playtime** (significantly worse):
   - This friend can play for half as long as Jack, which is:
     \[
     \text{Playtime} = \frac{20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 10 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - The number of quarters this friend uses in 4 hours is:
     \[
     \text{Quarters used by Friend 1} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters}
     \]

3. **Friend 2's Playtime** (also significantly worse):
   - This friend also plays for half as long as Jack, so they also play for 10 minutes.
   - The number of quarters this friend uses in 4 hours is the same as Friend 1:
     \[
     \text{Quarters used by Friend 2} = 24 \text{ quarters}
     \]

4. **Friend 3's Playtime** (significantly better):
   - This friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is:
     \[
     \text{Playtime} = 20 \text{ minutes} \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - The number of quarters this friend uses in 4 hours is:
     \[
     \text{Quarters used by Friend 3} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters}
     \]

5. **Total Quarters Used**:
   - Now we can sum up the quarters used by all players:
     \[
     \text{Total quarters} = 12 \text{ (Jack)} + 24 \text{ (Friend 1)} + 24 \text{ (Friend 2)} + 8 \text{ (Friend 3)} = 68 \text{ quarters}
     \]

6. **Total Money Used**:
   - Since each quarter costs $0.25, the total money used is:
     \[
     \text{Total money} = 68 \text{ quarters} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/quarter} = 17 \text{ dollars}

gsm8k,gsm8k-815,TrustRoute-NoCost,1,"Let's denote the amounts of each ingredient in ounces as follows:

- \( S \): amount of salt
- \( O \): amount of oil
- \( F \): amount of fragrance
- \( Z \): amount of citrus zest
- \( U \): amount of sugar

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. \( Z = F \) (the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance)
2. \( S = U \) (the same amount of salt as sugar)
3. \( O = 2S \) (twice as much oil as salt)
4. \( S = 2Z \) (twice as much salt as zest)

Since \( Z = F \), we can substitute \( F \) with \( Z \) in the equations.

Now, we can express everything in terms of \( Z \):

From \( S = 2Z \):
- \( S = 2Z \)

From \( U = S \):
- \( U = 2Z \)

From \( O = 2S \):
- \( O = 2(2Z) = 4Z \)

Now we can express the total amount of the mixture in terms of \( Z \):

\[
\text{Total} = S + O + F + Z + U
\]
Substituting the expressions we have:

\[
\text{Total} = (2Z) + (4Z) + Z + Z + (2Z)
\]

Combining like terms:

\[
\text{Total} = 2Z + 4Z + Z + Z + 2Z = 10Z
\]

We know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces:

\[
10Z = 10
\]

Dividing both sides by 10:

\[
Z = 1
\]

Now we can find the amounts of each ingredient:

- \( S = 2Z = 2(1) = 2 \) ounces of salt
- \( U = 2Z = 2(1) = 2 \) ounces of sugar
- \( F = Z = 1 \) ounce of fragrance
- \( Z = 1 \) ounce of citrus zest
- \( O = 4Z = 4(1) = 4 \) ounces of oil

Thus, the amount of oil Tanya uses is:

gsm8k,gsm8k-831,TrustRoute-NoCost,1,"To calculate the total cost for Angela's installation, we need to break down the costs based on the items she has and the firm's pricing structure.

1. **Base Installation Cost**: The firm charges a base fee of $129.00 for the installation of the first set of items, which includes:
   - 4 mirrors
   - 2 shelves
   - 1 chandelier
   - 10 pictures

2. **Items Angela Needs Installed**:
   - Mirrors: Angela has 6 mirrors.
   - Chandeliers: Angela has 2 chandeliers.
   - Pictures: Angela has 20 pictures.

1. **Determine the distance traveled by the kangaroos:**
   - If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway, we can denote the speed of one kangaroo as \( v \).
   - The total distance \( D \) traveled by the kangaroos can be calculated as:
     \[
     D = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 3v \times 18
     \]
   - However, since we are interested in the distance, we can simplify this to:
     \[
     D = 3v \times 18 = 54v
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

3. **Calculate the time it takes for the turtles to travel the same distance:**
   - The time \( t \) it takes for the turtles to travel the distance \( D \) can be calculated using the formula:

Let's denote:
- \( M \) as the number of students good at math,
- \( E \) as the number of students good at English,
- \( B \) as the number of students good at both subjects.

From the information given:
- Students good at math only = 5
- Students good at English only = 8

where:
- \( r \) is the interest rate per year,
- \( t \) is the time in years.

In this case:
- \( P = 300 \) (the initial investment),
- \( r = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75 \) (the interest rate per year),
- \( t = 3 \) (the number of years).

gsm8k,gsm8k-852,TrustRoute-NoCost,1,"To find the total cost of buying 3 baskets of green food and red food, we first need to determine how many of each type of basket is being purchased. Since the problem states ""3 baskets of green food and red food,"" we can assume we are buying a combination of both types of baskets.

Let's denote:
- \( g \) = number of green food baskets
- \( r \) = number of red food baskets

We can assume \( g + r = 3 \). 

Next, we know the costs:
- Cost of one basket of green food = $25
- Cost of one basket of red food = $18

However, since we get $2 off for each basket of red food, the effective cost of one basket of red food becomes:
- Effective cost of one basket of red food = $18 - $2 = $16

Now, we can calculate the total cost based on different combinations of green and red food baskets. The combinations can be:
1. 3 green baskets and 0 red baskets
2. 2 green baskets and 1 red basket
3. 1 green basket and 2 red baskets
4. 0 green baskets and 3 red baskets

Let's calculate the total cost for each combination:

1. **3 green baskets and 0 red baskets:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 3 \times 25 + 0 \times 16 = 75 + 0 = 75

- Let your age be \( x \).
- Since you are three years younger than your brother, your brother's age will be \( x + 3 \).
- Since you are two years older than your sister, your sister's age will be \( x - 2 \).
- Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age, so her age will be \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \).

Now, we can express the total age of the family:

\[
x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87

Now, let's simplify this equation step by step:

1. Combine the ages:
   \[
   x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87
   \]
   \[

   \]
   \[
   = 3x + 1 + 3x + 9 - 1
   \]
   \[
   = 6x + 9
   \]

2. Set the equation equal to 87:
   \[
   6x + 9 = 87
   \]

3. Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   6x = 87 - 9
   \]
   \[
   6x = 78

gsm8k,gsm8k-894,TrustRoute-NoCost,1,"Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \).

According to the problem:

1. Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.
2. Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.

Now, we can calculate the total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns:

- Joe paid Tasha $6 for mowing his lawn \( x \) times, so she made \( 6x \) from Joe.
- For Kamala, if we assume she paid the same rate of $6 per mow, then Tasha made \( 6 \times 3x = 18x \) from Kamala.
- For Alba, similarly, Tasha made \( 6 \times 5x = 30x \) from Alba.

Now, we can sum up the total earnings from mowing lawns:

\[
\text{Total from mowing} = 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x
\]

According to the problem, Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
54x + \text{Earnings from lemonade} = 80
\]

Let \( L \) represent the earnings from lemonade sales. Thus, we have:

\[
54x + L = 80
\]

To find \( L \), we need to determine \( x \). Since \( 54x \) must be less than or equal to $80, we can find the maximum value of \( x \):

\[
54x \leq 80 \implies x \leq \frac{80}{54} \approx 1.48
\]

Since \( x \) must be a whole number, the maximum integer value for \( x \) is 1.

Now, substituting \( x = 1 \) into the equation for total earnings from mowing:

\[
54(1) = 54
\]

Now substituting back into the equation for total earnings:

\[
54 + L = 80
\]

Solving for \( L \):

\[
L = 80 - 54 = 26

Thus, Tasha made **$26 from lemonade sales**.",0.00032715,5.225552082061768,,True

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + A + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   A = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's ages:
   \[
   P = A + J
   \]

Now, we can substitute \( A \) from the second equation into the first and third equations.

Substituting \( A \) in the first equation:
\[
P + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
P + 2J + 10 = 100
\]
Subtracting 10 from both sides gives:
\[
P + 2J = 90 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]

Now substituting \( A \) in the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
P = 2J + 10 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \( P + 2J = 90 \) (Equation 1)
2. \( P = 2J + 10 \) (Equation 2)

We can substitute Equation 2 into Equation 1:
\[
(2J + 10) + 2J = 90
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
4J + 10 = 90
\]
Subtracting 10 from both sides gives:
\[
4J = 80
\]
Dividing by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now we can find \( A \) using \( A = J + 10 \):
\[
A = 20 + 10 = 30
\]

Finally, we can find \( P \) using \( P = 2J + 10 \):
\[
P = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50

Thus, the ages are:

gsm8k,gsm8k-936,TrustRoute-NoCost,1,"To determine how much money Cameron would save by choosing to pay for additional hours instead of the 24-hour stay, we can break down the costs as follows:

1. **Cost of a 24-hour stay**: 
   - This is a flat rate of 1600 pesos.

2. **Cost of a 12-hour stay plus additional hours**:
   - Cameron checks in at 5 PM and checks out at 10 AM the next day.
   - From 5 PM to 5 AM is 12 hours.
   - From 5 AM to 10 AM is an additional 5 hours.
   - The cost for the first 12 hours is 1000 pesos.
   - For the additional 5 hours, the cost is 70 pesos per hour.

   Calculation for additional hours:
   \[
   \text{Cost for additional hours} = 5 \text{ hours} \times 70 \text{ pesos/hour} = 350 \text{ pesos}

2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo:
   \[
   B = A + 20
   \]

3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar:
   \[
   B = D + 10
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( B \) from the second and third equations into the first equation.

From \( B = A + 20 \), we can express \( A \) in terms of \( B \):
\[
A = B - 20
\]

From \( B = D + 10 \), we can express \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
\[
D = B - 10
\]

Now, substituting \( A \) and \( D \) into the total points equation:
\[
B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45
\]

Combining the terms:
\[
B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45

Now, add 30 to both sides:
\[
3B = 75

- Let \( J \) be the number of balls Jordan carried.
- Let \( A \) be the number of balls Jason carried.
- Let \( B \) be the number of balls Jeffrey carried.

From the problem, we know the following relationships:

1. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason:
   \[
   J = 2A
   \]

2. Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey:
   \[
   A = 2B
   \]

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls:
\[
A = 2
\]

Now we can substitute \( A \) into the equation for \( B \):
\[
2 = 2B \implies B = 1
\]

Next, we substitute \( A \) into the equation for \( J \):
\[
J = 2A = 2 \times 2 = 4

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the first day:**
   - On the first day, the pirates dug 10 holes.

2. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the second day:**
   - On the second day, they dug 13 holes.

gsm8k,gsm8k-963,TrustRoute-NoCost,1,"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe as \( A \), \( S \), and \( D \) respectively. We can set up the following equations based on the information provided:

1. The total number of Pokemon caught by all three is:
   \[
   A + S + D = 339
   \]

2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan:
   \[
   A = S + 5
   \]

3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times what Adelwolfe has caught:
   \[
   S = 4D - 13
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( S \) into the first equation.

Substituting \( A \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[
(S + 5) + S + D = 339
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2S + D + 5 = 339
\]
Subtracting 5 from both sides gives:
\[
2S + D = 334 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]

Next, we substitute \( S \) from the third equation into Equation 1. First, we can express \( D \) in terms of \( S \):
\[
D = \frac{S + 13}{4}
\]

Now substitute this expression for \( D \) into Equation 1:
\[
2S + \frac{S + 13}{4} = 334
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 4:
\[
4(2S) + (S + 13) = 4 \times 334
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
8S + S + 13 = 1336
\]
Combining like terms gives:
\[
9S + 13 = 1336
\]
Subtracting 13 from both sides results in:
\[
9S = 1323
\]
Dividing both sides by 9 gives:
\[
S = 147
\]

Now that we have \( S \), we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
1. From \( A = S + 5 \):
   \[
   A = 147 + 5 = 152
   \]

2. From \( S = 4D - 13 \):
   \[
   147 = 4D - 13
   \]
   Adding 13 to both sides gives:
   \[
   160 = 4D
   \]
   Dividing by 4 gives:
   \[
   D = 40
   \]

Finally, we can verify the total:
\[
A + S + D = 152 + 147 + 40 = 339
\]
This confirms our calculations are correct.

Since Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30, we can calculate his age when he saw it the second time:

1. The first time Bill's dad saw the comet, he was 30 years old.
2. The second time the comet appeared, Bill's dad would be \( 30 + 75 = 105 \) years old.

Now, according to the problem, Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw it the first time. Therefore:

\]

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The remaining flights can be calculated as:

\[
x - \frac{3}{4}x = \frac{1}{4}x
\]

Since these remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France (and also to Germany) is:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{4}x \right) = \frac{1}{8}x
\]

Now, we also know that the second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
44 = \frac{1}{2}x
\]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides by 2:

\[
x = 88

According to the problem, the total age of the children is 20. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[

Substituting the known ages of Akbar and Alessandro:

\[
3 + 4 + H + W = 20

This simplifies to:

\[
H + W = 20 - 7

\[
H + W = 13 \quad \text{(1)}

gsm8k,gsm8k-999,TrustRoute-NoCost,1,"To solve the problem, we need to determine how to divide the watermelon among the family members while adhering to the condition that each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid.

Let's denote the size of the slice each kid receives as \( k \). Since there are 4 kids, the total size of the slices for the kids is:

\[
\text{Total size for kids} = 4k
\]

Each adult receives a slice that is twice the size of a kid's slice, so each adult gets:

\[
\text{Slice for each adult} = 2k
\]

Since there are 2 adults, the total size of the slices for the adults is:

\[
\text{Total size for adults} = 2 \times 2k = 4k
\]

Now, we can find the total size of the watermelon by adding the total size for the kids and the total size for the adults:

\[
\text{Total size of watermelon} = \text{Total size for kids} + \text{Total size for adults} = 4k + 4k = 8k
\]

Next, we want to find out what percentage of the watermelon each adult gets. Since each adult gets a slice of size \( 2k \), we can calculate the percentage as follows:

\[
\text{Percentage for each adult} = \left( \frac{\text{Slice for each adult}}{\text{Total size of watermelon}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2k}{8k} \right) \times 100

Simplifying this expression:

\[
\text{Percentage for each adult} = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\%

gsm8k,gsm8k-1016,TrustRoute-NoCost,1,"To calculate the price of carrots after three years with a 5% annual increase, we can use the formula for compound interest:

\[
P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n
\]

Where:
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price,
- \( r \) is the rate of increase (as a decimal),
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) (initial price),
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% increase),
- \( n = 3 \) (number of years).

Now, substituting the values into the formula:

\[
P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3
\]

Calculating \( (1 + 0.05)^3 \):

\[
(1.05)^3 = 1.157625

1. **Probability of having a substitute teacher**: There is a 50% chance that Marcus will have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework. This means there is a 50% chance that he will have to turn in his homework if the normal teacher comes in.

2. **Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension**: If the normal teacher comes in (which happens with a 50% probability), there is a 40% chance that she will give everyone an extension. This means there is a 60% chance that she will not give an extension, and thus Marcus will have to turn in his homework.

3. **Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension**: If the normal teacher does not give an extension (60% chance), there is still a 20% chance that Marcus can convince her that his dog ate his homework and get a personal extension. This means there is an 80% chance that he will have to turn in his homework even if he does not get the class extension.

Now, let's calculate the total probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:

- **Case 1**: Substitute teacher (50% chance)
  - He does not have to turn in homework: 0% chance (since the substitute won't collect it)

- **Case 2**: Normal teacher (50% chance)
  - She gives an extension: 40% chance (he does not have to turn in homework)
  - She does not give an extension: 60% chance
    - He gets a personal extension: 20% chance (he does not have to turn in homework)
    - He does not get a personal extension: 80% chance (he has to turn in homework)

Now we can calculate the probabilities for the normal teacher case:

- Probability of having to turn in homework with the normal teacher:
  - Probability of not getting an extension and not getting a personal extension:
  \[
  P(\text{not getting extension}) \times P(\text{not getting personal extension}) = 0.60 \times 0.80 = 0.48

Now, we combine the probabilities:

- Probability of having to turn in homework:

P(\text{substitute}) \times P(\text{turn in homework | substitute}) + P(\text{normal teacher}) \times P(\text{turn in homework | normal teacher})
\]
\[

Now, we can set up the equation based on the total amount shared:

\[
x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920
\]

Now, simplify the equation:

1. Combine like terms:
   \[
   x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920
   \]
   \[
   4x + 240 = 1920

2. **Calculate the total hours worked by the team**:
   - Each day, the team worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day.
   - Total hours worked by the team = Total days × Hours worked per day.

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.

The total number of tennis balls retrieved across all three sets is given as 19. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Now, let's simplify this equation step by step:

1. Combine like terms:
   \[
   2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
   \]

2. To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 2:
   \[
   2(2x + 4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2 \cdot 19
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   4x + 8 + x = 38
   \]

3. Combine the \( x \) terms:
   \[
   5x + 8 = 38

1. **Initial Price**: $20,000
2. **Depreciation Rate**: 21% per year
3. **Years**: From 2007 to 2010 is 3 years.

The formula to calculate the price after depreciation for each year is:

Substituting the values:

- Initial Price = $20,000
- Depreciation Rate = 0.21
- \( n = 3 \)

1. **Cost of the cast**: $200

2. **Cost of the doctor's visit**: 
   - The doctor charges $300 per hour.
   - Since the visit lasts for 30 minutes, we need to convert this to hours: 
     \[
     30 \text{ minutes} = 0.5 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Therefore, the cost for the visit is:
     \[
     0.5 \text{ hours} \times 300 \text{ dollars/hour} = 150 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Cost of painkillers**:

1. **Cost of Butter Without Promotion**:
   - The price of butter is $4.00 per pound.
   - For 6 pounds of butter, the cost without any promotion would be:
     \[
     6 \text{ pounds} \times 4.00 \text{ dollars/pound} = 24.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Understanding the Promotion**:
   - The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means that for every pound of butter purchased, the second pound will cost half price.
   - If Dennis buys 2 pounds, he pays full price for the first pound and half price for the second pound:
     - First pound: $4.00
     - Second pound: $2.00 (half of $4.00)
     - Total for 2 pounds: $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00

gsm8k,gsm8k-1077,TrustRoute-NoCost,1,"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the arrival and departure times of each train step by step.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - Departure time: \(10 + 20 = 30\) minutes after Paul arrives.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives half an hour (30 minutes) after the first train leaves.
   - Arrival time: \(30 + 30 = 60\) minutes after Paul arrives.
   - Stays for a quarter of the first train's stay: \(20 / 4 = 5\) minutes.
   - Departure time: \(60 + 5 = 65\) minutes after Paul arrives.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives an hour (60 minutes) after the second train leaves.
   - Arrival time: \(65 + 60 = 125\) minutes after Paul arrives.
   - Leaves immediately after it arrives, so it departs at 125 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - Arrival time: \(125 + 20 = 145\) minutes after Paul arrives.

gsm8k,gsm8k-1082,TrustRoute-NoCost,1,"To determine how long it took James to reach the store, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Distance to the store**: The store is 4 miles from James's home.
2. **Halfway point**: When James is halfway to the store, he has walked 2 miles (since half of 4 miles is 2 miles).
3. **Walking back**: After realizing he forgot something, he walks back the 2 miles to his home.
4. **Total distance walked**: James walks 2 miles to the halfway point and then 2 miles back home, totaling 4 miles.
5. **Walking speed**: James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.

Now, we can calculate the time taken for each segment of the walk:

- **Time to walk to the halfway point** (2 miles):
  \[
  \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours}

Since the total amount of fence is 100 feet, we can set up the following equation:

\[
S + H = 100
\]

Substituting \( H \) with \( S + 60 \):

\[
S + (S + 60) = 100
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2S + 60 = 100
\]

Now, we can solve for \( S \):

1. Subtract 60 from both sides:

\[
2S = 100 - 60
\]
\[
2S = 40
\]

2. Divide both sides by 2:

\[
S = 20
\]

Now that we have \( S \), we can find how much Harry gets:

2. **Calculate the total minutes John spends in extra classes:**
   - John has 2 extra classes each day for 5 days.
   - Each extra class is also 40 minutes long.
   - Total minutes in extra classes = 2 extra classes/day * 40 minutes/class * 5 days/week.

   \[
   \text{Total minutes in extra classes} = 2 \times 40 \times 5 = 400 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total minutes spent in learning during the week:**

4. **Calculate the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - First, calculate the total weekly minutes:
     - There are 7 days in a week, and each day has 24 hours.
     - Total minutes in a week = 7 days * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour.

   \[
   \text{Total minutes in a week} = 7 \times 24 \times 60 = 10080 \text{ minutes}
   \]

   - Now, find 1/16 of the weekly minutes:
   \[
   \text{Extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday} = \frac{10080}{16} = 630 \text{ minutes}
   \]

   - Since this extra time is spent equally on Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time is:
   \[
   \text{Total extra learning time} = 630 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Add the extra learning time to the total learning time:**
   - Total learning time for the week = Total minutes spent learning + Total extra learning time.

1. **Amalia's Time**:
   - Amalia mowed the lawn, which took her 4 hours.

2. **Megan's Time**:
   - Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to complete her chore.
   - Therefore, Megan's time = Amalia's time + 2 hours = 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours.

3. **Dior's Time**:
   - Dior took well over 4 hours longer than the time Amalia took to mow the lawn.
   - Since Amalia took 4 hours, Dior's time = Amalia's time + 4 hours + (some additional time).
   - For the sake of calculation, let's assume ""well over"" means exactly 4 hours longer (as a minimum). Thus, Dior's time = 4 hours + 4 hours = 8 hours.
   - However, since ""well over"" implies more than 4 hours, we can say Dior's time is at least 8 hours, but we will use 8 hours for our total calculation.

Now, we can calculate the total time taken by all three:

- Total time = Amalia's time + Megan's time + Dior's time
- Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours + 8 hours = 18 hours.

gsm8k,gsm8k-1122,TrustRoute-NoCost,1,"To find out how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we first need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers during their 10-hour shift.

1. **Calculate the production of the first two workers:**
   - Each of these two workers produces 6 toys per hour.
   - In 10 hours, one worker produces: \( 6 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ toys} \).
   - Therefore, for two workers: \( 60 \text{ toys} \times 2 = 120 \text{ toys} \).

2. **Calculate the production of the next two workers:**
   - Each of these two workers produces 4 toys per hour.
   - In 10 hours, one worker produces: \( 4 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ toys} \).
   - Therefore, for two workers: \( 40 \text{ toys} \times 2 = 80 \text{ toys} \).

3. **Calculate the total production of the first four workers:**
   - Total toys produced by the first four workers: \( 120 \text{ toys} + 80 \text{ toys} = 200 \text{ toys} \).

4. **Determine how many toys are still needed:**
   - The manufacturer needs to produce a total of 400 toys.
   - After the shift, they have produced 200 toys, so they still need: \( 400 \text{ toys} - 200 \text{ toys} = 200 \text{ toys} \).

5. **Calculate the production of the fifth worker:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker.
   - The fifth worker also works for 10 hours, so the total production by the fifth worker is \( 10x \).
   - We know that the total toys produced by all workers must equal 400 toys, so we set up the equation:
     \[
     200 \text{ toys} + 10x = 400 \text{ toys}

- Arnold: \( x \)
- Madeline: \( x \)

Next, let’s denote the number of eggs painted by Sarah as \( y \). According to the problem, Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so we can express Camden's number of painted eggs as:

- Camden: \( y + 12 \)

We know that Camden and Sarah together painted a total of 30 eggs:

\[
y + (y + 12) = 30
\]

Simplifying this equation:

\[
2y + 12 = 30
\]

Subtracting 12 from both sides gives:

\[
2y = 18
\]

Dividing both sides by 2 results in:

\[
y = 9
\]

Now that we have Sarah's number of painted eggs, we can find Camden's:

\[
\text{Camden} = y + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21
\]

Now we know:

- Sarah: 9 eggs
- Camden: 21 eggs

Next, we can find the total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline:

\[
\text{Total eggs} = \text{Arnold} + \text{Madeline} + \text{Camden} + \text{Sarah}

We know that Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We also know that she spends 40 minutes walking on the beach.

First, we need to convert the time spent on the beach into hours since the speeds are in miles per hour. 

\[
40 \text{ minutes} = \frac{40}{60} \text{ hours} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ hours}

So, \( v = 3 \) miles per hour. Consequently, her speed on the sidewalk is:

\[
2v = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour}

Next, we calculate the time it takes her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk:

\[
\text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{6 \text{ miles per hour}} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ hours}

2. **Determine how many bottles Hortex currently produces**: 
   Hortex produces 4200 bottles per day.

3. **Calculate the additional bottles needed**: 
   To find out how many more bottles are needed, subtract the current production from the total bottles needed:

   \[
   \text{Additional bottles needed} = \text{Total bottles needed} - \text{Current production}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Additional bottles needed} = 11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles}

2. **Determine how many of each color wear bows:**
   - All blue-wearers wear bows, so:
     \[
     \text{Number of blue-wearers with bows} = 2
     \]
   - \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the purple-wearers wear bows:
     \[

   \]

3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount (50 fruits).
   \[
   \text{Fruits at 7 years} = 7 \times 50 = 350

4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. We will calculate the 10-year-old tree's production first.
   
5. **9-year-old tree**: Produces no fruits.
   \[
   \text{Fruits at 9 years} = 0

- Let \( r \) be the length of the red rope.
- Let \( b \) be the length of the blue rope.
- Let \( y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope:
   \[
   r = 4b
   \]

2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope:
   \[
   b = y - 7
   \]

3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters:
   \[
   r + b + y = 37
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( r \) and \( b \) into the combined length equation.

Substituting \( r = 4b \) into the combined length equation:
\[
4b + b + y = 37
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
5b + y = 37
\]

Next, we substitute \( b = y - 7 \) into the equation \( 5b + y = 37 \):
\[
5(y - 7) + y = 37
\]
Expanding this gives:
\[
5y - 35 + y = 37
\]
Combining like terms results in:
\[
6y - 35 = 37
\]
Adding 35 to both sides:
\[
6y = 72
\]
Dividing by 6:
\[
y = 12

Now that we have the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
\[
b = y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5

gsm8k,gsm8k-1176,TrustRoute-NoCost,1,"To determine how many days the teacher can use the chalk before needing to recycle it, we first need to calculate how much chalk he has left after using 45% of the initial 5-inch piece.

1. **Calculate the amount of chalk used on Monday:**
   \[
   \text{Chalk used on Monday} = 45\% \text{ of } 5 \text{ inches} = 0.45 \times 5 = 2.25 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining chalk} = 5 \text{ inches} - 2.25 \text{ inches} = 2.75 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Determine the daily usage going forward:**
   The teacher plans to use 20% of the remaining chalk each day.
   \[
   \text{Daily usage} = 20\% \text{ of } 2.75 \text{ inches} = 0.20 \times 2.75 = 0.55 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Calculate how many days he can use the remaining chalk before it goes below 2 inches:**
   The teacher will recycle the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. Therefore, we need to find out how many days it takes for the chalk to go from 2.75 inches to 2 inches.

   The amount of chalk he can use before reaching 2 inches is:
   \[
   \text{Chalk to use before recycling} = 2.75 \text{ inches} - 2 \text{ inches} = 0.75 \text{ inches}
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of days he can use the chalk:**
   To find the number of days, we divide the amount of chalk he can use before recycling by the daily usage:
   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{0.75 \text{ inches}}{0.55 \text{ inches/day}} \approx 1.36 \text{ days}

1. **Teeth drilled**: The dentist drills 4 teeth.
2. **Teeth capped**: The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, which means he caps \(4 + 7 = 11\) teeth.

Now, we can calculate the total number of teeth fixed by the dentist:

\[
\text{Total teeth fixed} = \text{Teeth drilled} + \text{Teeth capped} = 4 + 11 = 15
\]

Next, we need to find the percentage of James' total teeth that the dentist fixed. James has a total of 30 teeth.

The percentage can be calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Total teeth fixed}}{\text{Total teeth}} \right) \times 100

gsm8k,gsm8k-1181,TrustRoute-NoCost,1,"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now:
   \[
   W = 5 \times (C + 7)
   \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now:
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} W
   \]

Now we can solve these equations step by step.

### Step 1: Rewrite the first equation
From the first equation:
\[
W = 5(C + 7) = 5C + 35
\]

### Step 2: Substitute \( W \) in the second equation
Now, substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35)
\]

### Step 3: Clear the fraction
Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5C + 35
\]
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

### Step 4: Rearrange the equation
Now, rearranging gives:
\[
75 - 35 = 5C - 3C
\]
\[
40 = 2C
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( C \)
Divide both sides by 2:
\[
C = 20
\]

### Conclusion
Colin is currently \( \boxed{20} \) years old. 

### Verification
To verify, we can find Wendy's age:
1. Calculate Wendy's age using \( C = 20 \):
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7) = 5(20 + 7) = 5 \times 27 = 135
   \]

2. Check the second condition:
   In 25 years, Colin will be:
   \[
   C + 25 = 20 + 25 = 45
   \]
   And Wendy's current age is 135. Check if:
   \[
   45 = \frac{1}{3} \times 135

   \[
   45 = 45

1. **Cost of Scotch**: John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total of $600. Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is:
   \[
   \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Number of Cognac Bottles**: John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as he does of scotch. Since he bought 10 bottles of scotch, he buys:
   \[
   \text{Number of cognac bottles} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles}
   \]

3. **Cost per Bottle of Cognac**: The cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:
   \[
   \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 + (0.5 \times 60) = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total Cost of Cognac**: The total cost for the 20 bottles of cognac is:
   \[
   \text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Total Cost of Everything**: Finally, we add the total cost of scotch and the total cost of cognac:

2. **Second Day Planting:**
   - On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day:
     \[
     20 + 10 = 30 \text{ White Oak trees}
     \]
   - He planted \( \frac{1}{4} \) more Lodgepole Pine trees than he planted on the first day. The number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day was 40, so:
     \[
     \text{Additional Lodgepole Pine} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10

   - The cost per dozen is $2.40.
   - Total cost = Number of dozens × Cost per dozen
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 5 \times 2.40 = 12.00
   \]
   So, Rose's total cost is $12.00.

2. **Calculate the total number of eggs:**
   - There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
   - Total number of eggs = Number of dozens × Eggs per dozen
   \[
   \text{Total number of eggs} = 5 \times 12 = 60
   \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs:**

We also know that the total number of ice cubes made is 116, which gives us the equation:

\[
s + b = 116
\]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( b \) into the total equation:

\[
s + (5s - 4) = 116

1. **First Day:**
   - Number of people = 50

2. **Second Day:**
   - Number of people = Number on the first day + 20
   - Number of people = 50 + 20 = 70

3. **Third Day:**
   - Number of people = 2 × Number on the second day
   - Number of people = 2 × 70 = 140

4. **Days Remaining in the Week:**
   - There are 7 days in a week, and we have already accounted for 3 days.
   - Therefore, there are 4 days remaining.
   - Average number of people Conor saw each day for the remaining 4 days = 60
   - Total for the remaining 4 days = 60 × 4 = 240

1. **First 30 seconds**: 
   - Number of pops = 20

2. **Next 30 seconds** (three times the amount from the first 30 seconds):
   - Number of pops = 3 * 20 = 60

3. **Next 30 seconds** (four times the initial popping rate):
   - Initial rate = 20 pops in the first 30 seconds
   - Four times the initial rate = 4 * 20 = 80
   - Number of pops = 80

4. **Final 30 seconds** (half the rate of the previous 30 seconds):

1. **Passion Fruit**: 
   - Cost per pound: $6
   - Amount needed: 2 pounds
   - Total cost for passion fruit: \( 2 \, \text{pounds} \times 6 \, \text{dollars/pound} = 12 \, \text{dollars} \)

   - Beakers: 7
   - Petri dishes: 14

2. Igor gathered:
   - Test tubes: \( T = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) (half of the requested amount)
   - Petri dishes: \( P = 14 + 2 = 16 \) (two more than requested)
   - Beakers: \( B = 7 \) (the correct number initially)

However, Igor lost some beakers on the way to the lab bench. Let's denote the number of beakers Igor lost as \( x \). Therefore, the number of beakers he actually placed on the lab bench is \( B - x = 7 - x \).

Now, we can set up the equation for the total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench:

\[
T + (B - x) + P = 29
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
8 + (7 - x) + 16 = 29
\]

Simplifying this equation:

\[
8 + 7 - x + 16 = 29
\]

\[
31 - x = 29
\]

Now, solving for \( x \):

\[
-x = 29 - 31
\]
\[
-x = -2
\]
\[
x = 2
\]

Thus, Igor lost **2 beakers**.",0.0002419499999999,4.02514123916626,,True

gsm8k,gsm8k-1310,TrustRoute-NoCost,1,"Let's analyze the information given in the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the speeds**:
   - Let \( v \) be Vanessa's speed in miles per minute.
   - Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Aaron's speed is \( 2v \).

2. **Distance run**:
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles.
   - We need to find out how far Aaron ran. Since Vanessa can run twice as far as Aaron, if we let \( d \) be the distance Aaron ran, we have:
     \[
     4 = 2d \implies d = 2 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Time taken by Aaron**:
   - We know that Aaron completed his part of the race (2 miles) in 16 minutes. We can use this to find Aaron's speed:
     \[
     \text{Speed of Aaron} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{8} \text{ miles per minute}
     \]

4. **Finding Vanessa's speed**:
   - Since Aaron's speed is \( 2v \) and we found it to be \( \frac{1}{8} \) miles per minute, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     2v = \frac{1}{8} \implies v = \frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute}
     \]

5. **Calculating the time taken by Vanessa**:
   - Now we can find out how long it took Vanessa to run 4 miles using her speed:
     \[

gsm8k,gsm8k-1317,TrustRoute-NoCost,1,"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( W \).

We have two pieces of information:

1. The total number of animals is 20:
   \[
   C + W = 20
   \]

2. The total number of legs is 70. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each:
   \[
   2C + 4W = 70
   \]

Now we can solve these equations step by step.

From the first equation, we can express \( W \) in terms of \( C \):
\[
W = 20 - C
\]

Now, we can substitute \( W \) into the second equation:
\[
2C + 4(20 - C) = 70
\]

Distributing the 4:
\[
2C + 80 - 4C = 70
\]

Combining like terms:
\[
-2C + 80 = 70
\]

Subtracting 80 from both sides:
\[
-2C = 70 - 80
\]
\[
-2C = -10
\]

Dividing both sides by -2:
\[
C = 5
\]
