1. **Calculate the total number of eggs laid per day**: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.

2. **Determine how many eggs she consumes**: 
   - She eats 3 eggs for breakfast.
   - She uses 4 eggs to bake muffins.
   - Total eggs consumed = 3 + 4 = 7 eggs.

3. **Calculate the number of eggs remaining**: 
   - Remaining eggs = Total eggs laid - Eggs consumed

1. The first friend's guess is 80.

2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess:
   - Half of the first guess: \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \)
   - So, the second friend's guess: \( 40 + 20 = 60 \)

3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess:

**Given information:**
- John has 13 lego sets initially
- He sells them for $15 each
- He buys 8 video games for $20 each
- He has $5 left after buying the video games

**Step 1: Calculate total money from selling lego sets**
- Money from lego sets = Number of sets sold × Price per set
- Money from lego sets = 13 × $15 = $195

1. **Understand the volume loss**: Freda's canned tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked. This means that if she starts with a certain volume of canned tomatoes, the final volume of sauce will be half of that.

2. **Calculate the initial volume of canned tomatoes**: Since Freda ended up with 32 ounces of sauce, and this is half the volume of the canned tomatoes she used, we can calculate the initial volume of canned tomatoes:

### Step 1: Understand the dimensions
- Each box has outer dimensions of 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
- The walls are 1 inch thick, which means we need to subtract the wall thickness from both sides of each dimension to get the inner dimensions.
- For a box, the inner dimension for each side is calculated as:  
  **Inner dimension = Outer dimension - 2 × wall thickness**

### Step 2: Calculate the inner dimensions
- Outer length: 6 inches  
  Inner length = 6 - 2 × 1 = 6 - 2 = 4 inches
- Outer width: 5 inches  
  Inner width = 5 - 2 × 1 = 5 - 2 = 3 inches
- Outer height: 4 inches  
  Inner height = 4 - 2 × 1 = 4 - 2 = 2 inches

So, the inner dimensions of one box are 4 inches by 3 inches by 2 inches.

### Step 3: Calculate the inner volume of one box
- The volume of a box is given by:  
  **Volume = Length × Width × Height**  
- Inner volume of one box = 4 inches × 3 inches × 2 inches = 24 cubic inches

### Step 4: Calculate the total inner volume for 3 boxes

1.  **Understand the Ratio:** The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water.

2.  **Find the Total Number of Parts:** Add the parts of the ratio together:
    7 (sugar) + 13 (water) = 20 parts

3.  **Determine the Value of One Part:** The total amount of sugar and water is 120 units. Divide the total units by the total parts:
    120 units / 20 parts = 6 units per part

4.  **Calculate the Amount of Sugar:** Since sugar represents 7 parts of the ratio, multiply the number of sugar parts by the value of one part:

**1. Calculate Lylah's salary four years ago:**
Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, meaning Adrien's salary was 130% of Lylah's salary.
So, Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary * 1.30
$40,000 = Lylah's salary * 1.30
Lylah's salary four years ago = $40,000 / 1.30
Lylah's salary four years ago ≈ $30,769.23

**2. Calculate Adrien's salary four years later:**
Adrien's salary increased by 40% from his salary four years ago.
Adrien's salary four years later = $40,000 * (1 + 0.40)
Adrien's salary four years later = $40,000 * 1.40
Adrien's salary four years later = $56,000

**3. Calculate Lylah's salary four years later:**
The problem states that ""Adrien's and Lylah's salary increased simultaneously."" Since Adrien's salary increased by 40% and no specific percentage is given for Lylah, the most reasonable interpretation is that Lylah's salary also increased by the same percentage (40%) to maintain the proportional relationship or because the ""simultaneous increase"" implies a uniform rate of increase for both.
Lylah's salary four years later = Lylah's salary four years ago * (1 + 0.40)
Lylah's salary four years later = ($40,000 / 1.30) * 1.40
Lylah's salary four years later ≈ $30,769.23 * 1.40
Lylah's salary four years later ≈ $43,076.92

- Each pad has 30 sheets.
- Therefore, sheets per week = 2 pads × 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of sheets used per month
- There are approximately 4 weeks in a month.
- Therefore, sheets per month = 60 sheets/week × 4 weeks = 240 sheets.

### Step 2: Calculate what Kael brought
- Kael brought twice the number of apples as Morisette: 2 × 5 apples = 10 apples.
- Kael brought half the number of oranges as Morisette: 8 oranges ÷ 2 = 4 oranges.
- Total fruits for Kael: 10 apples + 4 oranges = 14 fruits.

### Step 3: Add up the total fruits

**Blake's Distance:**
Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard football field. Each back-and-forth run consists of running 100 yards to one end and then 100 yards back, which totals 200 yards for each complete back-and-forth run.

So, for 15 back-and-forth runs:
\[
\text{Distance Blake runs} = 15 \times 200 \text{ yards} = 3000 \text{ yards}
\]

**Kelly's Distance:**
Kelly runs back and forth once on the 100-yard field, which is:
\[
\text{Distance for 1 back-and-forth run} = 200 \text{ yards}
\]

After that, she runs to the 40-yard line and back. The distance to the 40-yard line from the starting point is 40 yards, and the distance back is also 40 yards. Therefore, for one round trip to the 40-yard line:
\[
\text{Distance for 1 round trip to the 40-yard line} = 40 + 40 = 80 \text{ yards}
\]

She does this 34 times, so:
\[
\text{Distance Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back} = 34 \times 80 \text{ yards} = 2720 \text{ yards}

Now, we can calculate Kelly's total distance:
\[
\text{Total Distance Kelly runs} = 200 \text{ yards} + 2720 \text{ yards} = 2920 \text{ yards}

**Comparing Distances:**
Now we can find out how much farther the winner runs than the loser. Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2920 yards.

The difference in distance is:
\[

gsm8k,gsm8k-165,TrustRoute,1,"To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing after purchasing the computer and accessories, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she selected and then subtract that from her budget.

1. **Total Budget**: €1500
2. **Cost of the computer**: €1090
3. **Cost of the scanner**: €157
4. **Cost of the CD burner**: €74
5. **Cost of the printer**: €102

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the computer and accessories:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost of computer} + \text{Cost of scanner} + \text{Cost of CD burner} + \text{Cost of printer}
\]

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 1090 + 157 + 74 + 102
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

- \(1090 + 157 = 1247\)
- \(1247 + 74 = 1321\)
- \(1321 + 102 = 1423\)

So, the total cost of the computer and accessories is €1423.

Next, we subtract this total cost from her budget to find out how much money she has left for clothing:

\[
\text{Money left for clothing} = \text{Total Budget} - \text{Total Cost}

1. **Rats**: 
   - There are 3 cages of rats, and they are kept in equal groups.
   - Each rat receives 6 pieces of straw.

2. **Hamsters**: 
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters, with each hamster receiving 5 pieces of straw.

3. **Rabbits**: 
   - A total of 20 pieces of straw is distributed among the rabbits.

4. **Total straw distributed**: 
   - The total amount of straw distributed among all rodents is 160 pieces.

Now, let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \( r \).

### Step 1: Calculate the straw used for rats
Since there are 3 cages of rats and each rat receives 6 pieces of straw, the total straw used for the rats can be expressed as:
\[
\text{Straw for rats} = 3 \times r \times 6 = 18r
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the straw used for hamsters
Let \( h \) be the number of hamsters in each cage. The total straw used for the hamsters is:
\[
\text{Straw for hamsters} = 10 \times h \times 5 = 50h
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total straw used
The total straw distributed among all rodents is given by:
\[
\text{Total straw} = \text{Straw for rats} + \text{Straw for hamsters} + \text{Straw for rabbits}
\]
Substituting the expressions we have:
\[
160 = 18r + 50h + 20
\]

### Step 4: Simplify the equation
Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
140 = 18r + 50h
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( r \) and \( h \)
Now we have the equation:
\[
18r + 50h = 140
\]

To find integer solutions for \( r \) and \( h \), we can express \( h \) in terms of \( r \):
\[
50h = 140 - 18r
\]
\[
h = \frac{140 - 18r}{50}
\]

For \( h \) to be an integer, \( 140 - 18r \) must be divisible by 50. We can test integer values for \( r \):

1. **If \( r = 0 \)**:
   \[
   h = \frac{140 - 0}{50} = 2.8 \quad (\text{not an integer})
   \]

2. **If \( r = 1 \)**:
   \[
   h = \frac{140 - 18}{50} = \frac{122}{50} = 2.44 \quad (\text{not an integer})
   \]

3. **If \( r = 2 \)**:
   \[
   h = \frac{140 - 36}{50} = \frac{104}{50} = 2.08 \quad (\text{not an integer})
   \]

4. **If \( r = 3 \)**:
   \[
   h = \frac{140 - 54}{50} = \frac{86}{50} = 1.72 \quad (\text{not an integer})
   \]

5. **If \( r = 4 \)**:
   \[
   h = \frac{140 - 72}{50} = \frac{68}{50} = 1.36 \quad (\text{not an integer})
   \]

6. **If \( r = 5 \)**:
   \[
   h = \frac{140 - 90}{50} = \frac{50}{50} = 1 \quad (\text{integer})
   \]

### Conclusion
If \( r = 5 \), then \( h = 1 \). Thus, there are 5 rats in each cage.

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is \( \boxed{5} \).",0.00366205,22.997732639312744,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,
gsm8k,gsm8k-187,TrustRoute,1,"To calculate how much Mandy owes Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can use the formula for compound interest:

\[ A = P(1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the amount owed after \( n \) months,
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial amount owed),
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (as a decimal),
- \( n \) is the number of months.

In this case:
- \( P = 100 \) (the initial amount),
- \( r = 0.02 \) (2% as a decimal),
- \( n = 3 \) (the number of months).

Now, we can plug in the values:

\[ A = 100(1 + 0.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100(1.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 \times 1.061208 \]

2. **Cost of transportation**: The cost to transport each bag is $2, so the total transportation cost is:
   \[
   \text{Transportation cost} = 2x
   \]

3. **Total cost**: The total cost incurred by the trader is the sum of the cost of the bags and the transportation cost:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 20x + 2x = 22x
   \]

4. **Revenue from selling the bags**: The trader sells each bag for $30, so the total revenue from selling all the bags is:
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 30x
   \]

5. **Profit calculation**: The profit is calculated as the total revenue minus the total cost. According to the problem, the trader made a total profit of $400:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost}

1. **Cost of tickets**: The friends spent $20.25 on 3 tickets.

2. **Cost of food**: They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. 
   \[
   \text{Cost of food} = \text{Cost of tickets} - 4.50 = 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75
