Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. In 4 minutes, each pool would lose:

\[
\text{Water lost} = 4 \text{ gallons/minute} \times 4 \text{ minutes} = 16 \text{ gallons}
\]

Now, we can express the current amounts of water in both pools:

- The current amount of water in the small pool is:
\[
S - 16
\]

- The current amount of water in the big pool is:
\[
2S - 16
\]

According to the problem, now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
2S - 16 = 4(S - 16)
\]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:

1. Expand the right side:

1. **Initial Counts of Cards**:
   - Fire type: 30
   - Grass type: 20
   - Water type: 40

2. **Adjust for Lost and Bought Cards**:
   - Water type after losing 8 cards: \( 40 - 8 = 32 \)

1. **Base burrito cost**: $6.50
2. **Extra meat**: $2.00
3. **Extra cheese**: $1.00
4. **Avocado**: $1.00
5. **Sauces (2 at $0.25 each)**: \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\)
6. **Upgrade for chips and drink**: $3.00

Now, we can add all these costs together:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 6.50 + 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 + 3.00

Now, let's calculate how many fries Griffin had after these transactions:

- **Fries after Kyle took some**: 
  \[
  24 - 5 = 19 \text{ fries}
  \]

- **Fries after Billy took some**: 
  \[
  19 - 10 = 9 \text{ fries}
  \]

- **Fries after Colby took some**: 
  \[
  9 - 2 = 7 \text{ fries}
  \]

Now, we know that after all these transactions, Griffin had 7 fries. However, we are told that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. This means that the difference must be accounted for by the fries that Ginger gave to Griffin.

Let \(x\) be the number of fries that Ginger gave to Griffin. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
7 + x = 27
\]

Now, solving for \(x\):

\[
x = 27 - 7 = 20
\]

Thus, Ginger gave Griffin **20 fries**.",0.00252165,12.153470754623413,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,

The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is:

   \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
   \[

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation. 

Substituting \( R \) in the second equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
\]

Now, let's simplify the right side:
\[

1. **Calculate the total number of chocolate bars**:
   Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, and there are 8 packets.
   \[
   \text{Total chocolate bars} = 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ bars/packet} = 40 \text{ bars}

According to the problem:

1. The number of players on the offense is \( 2d \) (twice as many as on defense).
2. The number of players on special teams is \( \frac{d}{2} \) (half the number of players on defense).

The total number of members in the team is given as 105. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
d + 2d + \frac{d}{2} = 105
\]

Now, let's simplify the left side of the equation:

\[
d + 2d = 3d
\]

So we have:

\[
3d + \frac{d}{2} = 105
\]

To combine the terms, we can express \( 3d \) with a common denominator of 2:

\[
3d = \frac{6d}{2}
\]

Now, substituting this back into the equation gives:

\[
\frac{6d}{2} + \frac{d}{2} = 105
\]

Combining the fractions:

\[
\frac{6d + d}{2} = 105
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{7d}{2} = 105
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 2:

\[
7d = 210
\]

Now, divide both sides by 7:

\[
d = 30
\]

Thus, the number of players on the defense is \( \boxed{30} \).

To verify, we can calculate the number of players on offense and special teams:

- Offense: \( 2d = 2 \times 30 = 60 \)
- Special teams: \( \frac{d}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \)

1. **Calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has:**
   - Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.
   - The store initially had 50 marbles.
   - His father gave him \( \frac{2}{5} \) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna.

   First, calculate how many marbles his father gave him:
   \[
   \text{Marbles from father} = \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \text{ marbles}
   \]

   Now, add all the marbles together:
   \[

The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) can be calculated using the formula:

\[
V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}

\]

Now that we have the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:

\[
h = 2c = 2 \times 20 = 40
\]

So, Farmer Brown has 20 cows and 40 chickens.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total legs} = (\text{number of cows} \times \text{legs per cow}) + (\text{number of chickens} \times \text{legs per chicken})
\]

Substituting the values we found:

\[
\text{Total legs} = (20 \times 4) + (40 \times 2)
\]

Calculating each part:

\[
20 \times 4 = 80 \quad \text{(legs from cows)}
\]
\[
40 \times 2 = 80 \quad \text{(legs from chickens)}
\]

Now, adding these together:

\[
\text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 = 160
\]

Thus, the total number of legs of all the animals together is \( \boxed{160} \).",0.00218915,13.418982744216919,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,

   - Let \( x \) be the number of customers kicked out for not wearing masks. According to the problem, \( x = 3 \).

2. **Determine the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting**:
   - The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is given as ""four times that many minus 5"". Therefore, the number of shoplifters \( y \) can be calculated as:
   \[
   y = 4x - 5 = 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7

3. **Calculate the number of customers kicked out for physical violence**:
   - The problem states that ""three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence"". Thus, the number of customers kicked out for physical violence \( z \) is:
   \[
   z = 3y = 3(7) = 21
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of customers kicked out**:

According to the problem, the total number of popsicles they have together is 165. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
5x + 6x = 165
\]

Combining the terms on the left side gives us:

\[
11x = 165
\]

Next, we can solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 11:

\[
x = \frac{165}{11} = 15
\]

Now that we have the value of \( x \), we can find the number of popsicles each person has:

- Betty's popsicles: 
\[
5x = 5 \times 15 = 75
\]

- Sam's popsicles: 
\[
6x = 6 \times 15 = 90

   - Total cost for 2 pounds of taffy = $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

2. **Seashells Purchase**:
   - The mixed bag of seashells costs $1.50.

3. **Magnets Purchase**:
   - Each magnet costs $0.25, and she bought 4 magnets.
   - Total cost for magnets = 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.

Now, let's calculate the total amount spent:

- Total spent on taffy: $4.50
- Total spent on seashells: $1.50
- Total spent on magnets: $1.00

Total spent = $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00.

Now, we subtract the total spent from the amount of money Sally had:

- Initial amount: $10.00
- Amount spent: $7.00

Money left = $10.00 - $7.00 = $3.00.

Therefore, Sally has **$3.00** left.",0.0023698499999999997,16.658026456832886,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,

From the problem, we know:
- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- She gathers half of that from the shortest trees, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
- Therefore, the total number of apples Joanne gathers is:
  \[

Now, let's analyze the apples gathered by her sister:
- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- She gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- Her sister does not gather any apples from the average trees.

Thus, the total number of apples gathered by her sister is:

2. **Next 2 Days:**
   - He traveled only 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days over these 2 days.
   - 30% of 800 km = \( 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \).

   - If these 18 guests each have 2 hot dogs, the total number of hot dogs prepared is:
     \[
     18 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs/guest} = 36 \text{ hot dogs}

2. **Actual Guests**: However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hot dog.

3. **Total Hot Dogs Needed**: If all 40 guests want a second hot dog, we need to calculate the total number of hot dogs required:
   - Each of the 40 guests wants 2 hot dogs, so:

4. **Hot Dogs Prepared vs. Hot Dogs Needed**: The caterer prepared 36 hot dogs, but 80 hot dogs are needed.

5. **Shortfall Calculation**: To find out how many guests did not get a second hot dog, we need to determine how many guests can be served with the 36 hot dogs:
   - Each guest can have 1 hot dog initially, and then we can see how many can get a second hot dog with the remaining hot dogs.
   - After serving 1 hot dog to each of the 40 guests, we have:
     \[

6. **Second Hot Dog Distribution**: Now, since all 40 guests want a second hot dog, and we have no hot dogs left after the first round, it means:

1. **Sugar Cubes**: 
   - He buys 2 boxes, each weighing 1 pound.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = \(2 \times 1 = 2\) pounds.

2. **Carrots**: 
   - He buys 4 bags, each weighing 12 pounds.
   - Total weight of carrots = \(4 \times 12 = 48\) pounds.

3. **Hay**:

   - Total weight of hay = \(42 \times 75 = 3150\) pounds.

4. **Oats**: 
   - He buys 20 sacks, each weighing 65 pounds.

   \[
   2 \text{ packs} \times 4.00 \text{ dollars/pack} = 8.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Buy One Get One Free Offer**: With the buy one get one free offer, when Heather buys 2 packs, she effectively gets 2 packs for the price of 1. Therefore, she only pays for 1 pack:
   \[
   \text{Cost after BOGO} = 4.00 \text{ dollars}

4. **Applying the Coupon**: Heather has a $2.00 coupon. So, we subtract the coupon from the cost after the BOGO discount:

3. David found half of what Bodhi found:

Now, we can substitute \( D \) from the third equation into the first two equations.

Substituting \( D = \frac{1}{2} B \) into the second equation:
\[
L = \frac{1}{2} B + 7
\]

Now we substitute \( L \) and \( D \) into the first equation:
\[

Combining like terms:
\[

    *   If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then they can paint a whole house in 5 days * 2 = 10 days.

2.  **Convert one person's time to hours:**
    *   There are 24 hours in a day.
    *   So, one person takes 10 days * 24 hours/day = 240 hours to paint a whole house.

3.  **Calculate time for 5 people:**
    *   If 5 people work together, they will divide the work (or the time) evenly.
    *   Time for 5 people = (Time for 1 person) / (Number of people)
    *   Time for 5 people = 240 hours / 5 people = 48 hours.

gsm8k,gsm8k-528,TrustRoute-NoRep,3,"Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as \( C_O \) and the number of chairs Jenna has as \( C_J \). 

According to the problem:

1. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so:
   \[
   S_O = C_O - 2
   \]
   where \( S_O \) is the number of sofas Ophelia has.

2. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia:
   \[
   C_J = 3C_O
   \]

3. We know that Ophelia has 20 sofas:
   \[
   S_O = 20
   \]

From the first equation, we can express \( C_O \) in terms of \( S_O \):
\[
C_O = S_O + 2
\]
Substituting \( S_O = 20 \):
\[
C_O = 20 + 2 = 22
\]

Now we can find the number of chairs Jenna has using the second equation:
\[
C_J = 3C_O = 3 \times 22 = 66
\]

Next, we can find the number of sofas Jenna has. Since she also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs:
\[
S_J = C_J - 2 = 66 - 2 = 64
\]

Now we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have:
- Total sofas:
  \[
  S_O + S_J = 20 + 64 = 84
  \]
- Total chairs:
  \[
  C_O + C_J = 22 + 66 = 88
  \]

Finally, the total number of sofas and chairs combined is:
\[
\text{Total} = (S_O + S_J) + (C_O + C_J) = 84 + 88 = 172
\]

Thus, the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have is \( \boxed{172} \).",0.0036473499999999997,14.184100866317749,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,

1. The total amount Tom spent is $48.
2. The cost of the CD is $4.

From this, we can set up the equation:

3. **Set up the equation based on the cousin's age**:
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. In 8 years, Jame will be:
     \[
     22 + 8 = 30 \text{ years old}
     \]
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is:
     \[
     2 \times 30 = 60

   - Therefore, the cousin's age in 8 years can be expressed as:

   - Cost of the printer = $1,100 - $400 = $700

2. **Total cost of the items:**
   - Total cost = Cost of the computer + Cost of the monitors + Cost of the printer
   - We know the total cost is $2,400.

3. **Set up the equation:**
   - Let the cost of one monitor be \( m \).
   - Since Errol bought 2 monitors, the total cost of the monitors is \( 2m \).
   - Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     1,100 + 2m + 700 = 2,400

gsm8k,gsm8k-570,TrustRoute-NoRep,3,"To determine how many total action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Money Available**: Peter has $70.

2. **Days of Spending**: Peter will spend money from Sunday to Saturday, which is a total of 7 days.

3. **Daily Spending**: Since he wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week, we can calculate his daily spending:
   \[
   \text{Daily Spending} = \frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day}
   \]

4. **Spending from Sunday to Wednesday**: For the first four days (Sunday to Wednesday), Peter buys wooden action figures that cost $5 each. The total amount he spends during these four days is:
   \[
   \text{Total Spending (Sun to Wed)} = 10 \text{ dollars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Number of Wooden Action Figures**: The number of wooden action figures he buys is:
   \[
   \text{Number of Wooden Action Figures} = \frac{40 \text{ dollars}}{5 \text{ dollars/figure}} = 8 \text{ figures}
   \]

6. **Spending from Thursday to Saturday**: For the remaining three days (Thursday to Saturday), Peter spends the remaining amount of money. The total amount left after spending on wooden figures is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining Money} = 70 \text{ dollars} - 40 \text{ dollars} = 30 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   He spends this remaining amount over the next three days:
   \[
   \text{Total Spending (Thu to Sat)} = 10 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Number of Plastic Action Figures**: The number of plastic action figures he buys is:
   \[
   \text{Number of Plastic Action Figures} = \frac{30 \text{ dollars}}{2 \text{ dollars/figure}} = 15 \text{ figures}
   \]

8. **Total Action Figures**: Finally, we can calculate the total number of action figures Peter has by adding the wooden and plastic figures:
   \[
   \text{Total Action Figures} = 8 \text{ (wooden)} + 15 \text{ (plastic)} = 23 \text{ figures}

\[
3 \text{ boxes} \times 64 \text{ crayons/box} = 192 \text{ crayons}
\]

Next, we assume that each crayon can be broken down into small pieces. For the purpose of this problem, let's say each crayon can be considered as one small piece (since they are worn down). Therefore, Kate has 192 small pieces of crayons.

Now, Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together to make one muffin crayon. We can find out how many muffin crayons she can make by dividing the total number of small pieces by the number of pieces needed for one muffin crayon:

\[

- Day 3: 0 birds
- Day 4 and Day 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

Now, let's calculate the total number of birds seen:

1. For Days 1 and 2, we assume the 50 birds are split evenly, so:
   - Day 1: 25 birds
   - Day 2: 25 birds

2. For Days 4 and 5, we also assume the 120 birds are split evenly, so:
   - Day 4: 60 birds

**Amazon:**
- Cost of boots: $16
- Shipping cost: $4
- Total cost on Amazon = Cost of boots + Shipping cost
  \[
  \text{Total cost on Amazon} = 16 + 4 = 20 \text{ dollars}

**eBay:**
- Cost of boots: $13
- Shipping cost: Twice the shipping cost on Amazon, which is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) dollars.

gsm8k,gsm8k-593,TrustRoute-NoRep,3,"To determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's second-story window, we can model the height of the beanstalk over time.

1. **Initial height of the beanstalk**: 4 feet
2. **Height of the window**: 20 feet
3. **Growth pattern**: The beanstalk doubles its height every day.

We can express the height of the beanstalk after \( n \) days using the formula:

\[
\text{Height after } n \text{ days} = 4 \times 2^n
\]

We want to find the smallest integer \( n \) such that:

\[
4 \times 2^n > 20
\]

To solve this inequality, we can divide both sides by 4:

\[
2^n > 5
\]

Next, we can find \( n \) by determining the smallest integer \( n \) where \( 2^n \) exceeds 5. We can calculate the powers of 2:

- \( 2^0 = 1 \)
- \( 2^1 = 2 \)
- \( 2^2 = 4 \)
- \( 2^3 = 8 \)

From this, we see that:

- \( 2^2 = 4 \) (not greater than 5)
- \( 2^3 = 8 \) (greater than 5)

Thus, the smallest integer \( n \) that satisfies \( 2^n > 5 \) is \( n = 3 \).

gsm8k,gsm8k-635,TrustRoute-NoRep,3,"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we first need to calculate the maximum total cost per class that his parents are willing to accept.

Manny's total cost for the Karate classes is $60, and he has signed up for 10 classes. Therefore, the cost per class is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Cost per class} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of classes}} = \frac{60}{10} = 6
\]

Since the cost per class is $6, which is less than $10, he is currently within the acceptable range.

Now, let's denote the number of classes Manny can miss as \( x \). If he misses \( x \) classes, then he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes. The new cost per class, based on the number of classes he actually attends, will be:

\[
\text{New cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x}
\]

His parents will not sign him up again if this new cost exceeds $10:

\[
\frac{60}{10 - x} > 10
\]

To solve this inequality, we can multiply both sides by \( 10 - x \) (noting that \( 10 - x > 0 \) since he cannot miss all classes):

\[
60 > 10(10 - x)
\]

Expanding the right side:

\[
60 > 100 - 10x
\]

Rearranging the inequality gives:

\[
10x > 100 - 60
\]
\[
10x > 40
\]
\[
x > 4
\]

This means Manny can miss more than 4 classes. Since he cannot miss a fraction of a class, the maximum number of classes he can miss is 4. If he misses 4 classes, he will attend 6 classes, and the cost per class will be:

\[
\frac{60}{6} = 10
\]

If he misses 5 classes, he will attend 5 classes, and the cost per class will be:

\[
\frac{60}{5} = 12
\]

Since $12 exceeds $10, he cannot miss 5 classes.

Thus, the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again is:

3. **Cooking time for beans**: 
   - Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.
   - First, we need to calculate the combined cooking time of pork and rice:
     \[
     \text{Combined cooking time} = \text{Cooking time for rice} + \text{Cooking time for pork} = 30 + 50 = 80 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Now, the cooking time for beans is:
     \[
     \text{Cooking time for beans} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Combined cooking time} = \frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Total cooking time**: 
   - Now, we can find the total cooking time by adding the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans:
     \[
     \text{Total cooking time} = \text{Cooking time for rice} + \text{Cooking time for pork} + \text{Cooking time for beans} = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 \text{ minutes}

gsm8k,gsm8k-660,TrustRoute-NoRep,3,"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let:
- \( s \) = number of sheep
- \( g \) = number of geese

We know the following:
1. Each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs.
2. Each animal has 1 head.

From the problem, we can create the following equations:

1. The total number of legs:
   \[
   4s + 2g = 70
   \]

2. The total number of heads:
   \[
   s + g = 20
   \]

Now, we can solve these equations step by step.

First, we can solve the second equation for \( g \):
\[
g = 20 - s
\]

Next, we substitute \( g \) in the first equation:
\[
4s + 2(20 - s) = 70
\]

Expanding this gives:
\[
4s + 40 - 2s = 70
\]

Combining like terms:
\[
2s + 40 = 70
\]

Now, subtract 40 from both sides:
\[
2s = 30
\]

Dividing both sides by 2 gives:
\[
s = 15
\]

Now that we have the number of sheep, we can find the number of geese by substituting \( s \) back into the equation for \( g \):
\[
g = 20 - s = 20 - 15 = 5
\]

Thus, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( \boxed{15} \).",0.00339055,13.323007106781006,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,

   - The rest were neutral.

First, we calculate the number of neutral days:
- Total days = 30
- Good days = 12
- Bad days = 8
- Neutral days = Total days - (Good days + Bad days) = 30 - (12 + 8) = 30 - 20 = 10 neutral days.

Next, we analyze the distribution of her moods over the first 24 days:
- The first 8 days were good: 8 good days.
- The second 8 days were bad: 8 bad days.
- The third 8 days were neutral: 10 neutral days (but only 8 days were neutral in this segment, so she has 2 neutral days left).

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length. This means the length after the extension is:

She then adds 20 cm to the bottom of the dress, making the total length:

**Chocolate Ice Cream:**
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- The rate of production for chocolate ice cream is:
  \[
  \text{Rate}_{\text{chocolate}} = \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour}
  \]

**Vanilla Ice Cream:**
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- The rate of production for vanilla ice cream is:
  \[
  \text{Rate}_{\text{vanilla}} = \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour}
  \]

**Total Production Rate:**
Now, we can find the total production rate by adding the rates of both types of ice cream:
\[

Topher's shoe length is given as 8 feet and 4 inches. We can convert this to inches as follows:

1. Convert feet to inches:
   \[
   8 \text{ feet} = 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ inches}

According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. The total number of council members is 33:
   \[
   x + y = 33
   \]

2. The number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against:

gsm8k,gsm8k-779,TrustRoute-NoRep,3,"To find out how far the Llesis family's vacation spot is, we can break down the problem into two parts: the driving distance and the hiking distance.

1. **Driving Speed**: The family drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.

2. **Hiking Speed**: The hiking speed is given as 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. 
   - Half of their driving speed: \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) miles per hour.
   - Therefore, their hiking speed: \( 25 - 5 = 20 \) miles per hour.

3. **Time Spent Hiking**: It is given that they spent 1.5 hours hiking.

4. **Distance Hiked**: We can calculate the distance they hiked using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   So, the distance hiked is:
   \[
   \text{Distance hiked} = 20 \text{ miles/hour} \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Total Time for the Trip**: The total time for the trip is 6 hours, and they spent 1.5 hours hiking. Therefore, the time spent driving is:
   \[
   \text{Time driving} = 6 \text{ hours} - 1.5 \text{ hours} = 4.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

6. **Distance Driven**: We can calculate the distance they drove using the same formula:
   \[
   \text{Distance driven} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   So, the distance driven is:
   \[
   \text{Distance driven} = 50 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4.5 \text{ hours} = 225 \text{ miles}
   \]

7. **Total Distance to Vacation Spot**: The total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance driven} + \text{Distance hiked} = 225 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 255 \text{ miles}

gsm8k,gsm8k-780,TrustRoute-NoRep,3,"To determine the difference between Ava's and Emma's scores, we can set up the scoring based on the information provided.

Let:
- \( e \) = the number of enemies Emma jumps on
- \( b \) = the number of berries Emma collects
- \( t \) = the time (in seconds) Emma has left when she finishes the level

From the problem, we know:
- Ava jumps on \( e + 8 \) enemies.
- Ava collects \( b + 3 \) berries.
- Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower, so she has \( t - 4 \) seconds left.

Now we can calculate the scores for both Ava and Emma.

**Emma's Score:**
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Emma}} = 10e + 5b + 30t
\]

**Ava's Score:**
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10(e + 8) + 5(b + 3) + 30(t - 4)
\]

Now, let's expand Ava's score:
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10e + 80 + 5b + 15 + 30t - 120
\]
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10e + 5b + 30t - 25
\]

Now we can find the difference between Ava's and Emma's scores:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} - \text{Score}_{\text{Emma}}
\]
Substituting the scores:
\[
\text{Difference} = (10e + 5b + 30t - 25) - (10e + 5b + 30t)
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = -25
\]

Thus, the difference between Ava's and Emma's scores is \(-25\). This means Ava's score is 25 points lower than Emma's score.

**Final Answer:**
The difference between their two scores is 25 points, with Emma having the higher score.",0.00441015,19.601762056350708,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,

Initially, Bob had:
- 3 orange fish
- 4 white fish

After buying the fish, he has:
- \( 3 + x \) orange fish
- \( 4 + y \) white fish

According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[
3 + x = 2(4 + y)
\]

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17:

\[
x + y = 17
\]

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. \( 3 + x = 2(4 + y) \)
2. \( x + y = 17 \)

Let's simplify the first equation:

\[
3 + x = 8 + 2y
\]
\[
x - 2y = 5 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]

Now we can use the second equation \( x + y = 17 \) to express \( x \) in terms of \( y \):

\[
x = 17 - y \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\]

Now substitute Equation 2 into Equation 1:

\[
(17 - y) - 2y = 5
\]
\[
17 - 3y = 5
\]
\[
-3y = 5 - 17
\]
\[
-3y = -12
\]
\[
y = 4
\]

Now that we have \( y \), we can find \( x \):

\[
x = 17 - y = 17 - 4 = 13
\]

Thus, Bob bought:
- \( x = 13 \) orange fish
- \( y = 4 \) white fish

Therefore, the number of white fish Bob bought at the store is \( \boxed{4} \).",0.00386035,12.039226531982422,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,

1. **Initial number of employees**: 200
2. **Number of new employees hired each month**: 20
3. **Salary per employee per month**: $4000
4. **Duration**: 3 months

### Step-by-step Calculation:

1. **Calculate the total number of employees after 3 months**:
   - After 1 month: \( 200 + 20 = 220 \)
   - After 2 months: \( 220 + 20 = 240 \)
   - After 3 months: \( 240 + 20 = 260 \)

   So, after 3 months, the total number of employees is **260**.

2. **Calculate the total salary paid each month**:
   - Total salary for 260 employees in one month: 
   \[
   260 \times 4000 = 1,040,000

- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt.
- Since she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \).
- She uses twice as much oil as salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2s \).
- She uses twice as much salt as zest, so \( s = 2z \).

Now we can express all the ingredients in terms of \( z \):

2. Fragrance: \( z \)
3. Salt: \( s = 2z \)
4. Sugar: \( s = 2z \)

- Becca has \( B = S + 12 = 3P + 12 \) (since Becca has 12 more than Smendrick).

The total number of cards is given as 341. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos**:
   - We know that 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway. 
   - The time taken by the kangaroos does not depend on the number of kangaroos since they are traveling together. Therefore, we can consider the time it takes for one kangaroo to cross the highway as 18 hours.

2. **Calculate the distance**:
   - Let \( D \) be the distance across the highway. The speed of the kangaroos can be denoted as \( v_k \).
   - Since speed is distance divided by time, we have:
     \[
     D = v_k \times 18
     \]

3. **Determine the speed of the turtles**:
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of a turtle \( v_t \) is:
     \[
     v_t = \frac{1}{2} v_k
     \]

4. **Calculate the time for the turtles to cross the highway**:
   - The time \( t \) it takes for the turtles to cross the highway can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     t = \frac{D}{v_t}
     \]
   - Substituting \( D \) and \( v_t \):

   - Jack collected 60 dishes.
   - According to the problem, Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks. Therefore, if \( S_J \) is the number of socks Jack has, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     2 \times S_J = 60

- Since you are two years older than your sister, your sister's age will be \( x - 2 \).
- Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age, so her age will be \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \).

Now, we can express the total sum of all ages:

1. **Red Cars**: The number of red cars is given as 12.

2. **Green Cars**: The number of green cars is 2 fewer than the number of red cars. Therefore:
   \[
   \text{Green Cars} = \text{Red Cars} - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10
   \]

3. **Blue Cars**: The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars. Therefore:
   \[
   \text{Blue Cars} = 3 \times \text{Green Cars} = 3 \times 10 = 30
   \]

4. **Total Cars**: We know the total number of cars in the rink is 75. We can find the number of yellow cars by first calculating the total number of red, green, and blue cars:
   \[
   \text{Total of Red, Green, and Blue Cars} = \text{Red Cars} + \text{Green Cars} + \text{Blue Cars} = 12 + 10 + 30 = 52
   \]

5. **Yellow Cars**: To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the total of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:
   \[
   \text{Yellow Cars} = \text{Total Cars} - \text{Total of Red, Green, and Blue Cars} = 75 - 52 = 23

gsm8k,gsm8k-866,TrustRoute-NoRep,3,"Let's denote the number of books that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have as \( S \), \( A \), and \( F \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. The total number of books is 85:
   \[
   S + A + F = 85
   \]

2. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne:
   \[
   S = A + 25
   \]

3. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn:
   \[
   A = F - 12
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) into the total books equation.

First, substitute \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[
S = (F - 12) + 25
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
S = F + 13
\]

Now we have expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
- \( S = F + 13 \)
- \( A = F - 12 \)

Substituting these into the total books equation:
\[
(F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85
\]

Combining like terms:
\[
3F + 1 = 85
\]

Now, subtract 1 from both sides:
\[
3F = 84
\]

Dividing both sides by 3 gives:
\[
F = 28
\]

Thus, Fawn has **28 books**. 

To verify:
- If \( F = 28 \), then \( A = F - 12 = 28 - 12 = 16 \).
- Then \( S = A + 25 = 16 + 25 = 41 \).
- Checking the total: \( S + A + F = 41 + 16 + 28 = 85 \), which is correct.

According to the problem:

1. Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.
2. The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.

Now, we can calculate how much Tasha earned from mowing lawns:

- Joe paid Tasha $6 for mowing his lawn \( x \) times, so she earned:
  \[
  \text{Earnings from Joe} = 6x
  \]

- For Kamala, if we assume she charges the same amount per lawn mowing, her earnings from Kamala would be:
  \[
  \text{Earnings from Kamala} = 6 \cdot 3x = 18x
  \]

- For Alba, her earnings would be:
  \[
  \text{Earnings from Alba} = 6 \cdot 5x = 30x
  \]

Now, we can sum up her total earnings from mowing lawns:
\[
\text{Total earnings from mowing} = 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x
\]

According to the problem, Tasha made a total of $80 from both selling lemonade and mowing lawns. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[
54x + \text{Earnings from lemonade} = 80
\]

Let \( L \) be the earnings from lemonade sales. Then we have:
\[
54x + L = 80
\]

Now, we need to find \( x \). Since \( 54x \) must be less than or equal to $80, we can find the maximum possible value for \( x \):
\[
54x \leq 80 \implies x \leq \frac{80}{54} \approx 1.48
\]

Since \( x \) must be a whole number, the maximum integer value for \( x \) is 1.

Now, substituting \( x = 1 \) into the earnings from mowing:
\[
54(1) = 54
\]

Now substituting back into the total earnings equation:

54 + L = 80 \implies L = 80 - 54 = 26

According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago:
\[
D - 8 = 2(A - 4)
\]

Substituting \( D = 60 \) into the equation:
\[
52 = 2(A - 4)
\]

Now, we can solve for \( A \):
1. Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   26 = A - 4

2. Add 4 to both sides:
   \[
   A = 26 + 4 = 30

So, Adam's current age is \( A = 30 \).

- The total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58.

Now, we can set up the equation based on the number of pieces of bologna thrown:

\[
2 \times \text{(number of red balloons)} + 3 \times \text{(number of yellow balloons)} = \text{total pieces of bologna}

Now we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):

From the second equation:
\[

From the third equation:
\[
D = B - 10

Now we can substitute \( A \) and \( D \) into the total points equation:

   - Third day: 8 holes (but they filled in 2 holes)

   So, the total holes dug on the third day is \( 8 - 2 = 6 \) holes.

   Now, we can sum the holes dug over the three days:

1. \( A + S + D = 339 \) (the total number of Pokemon caught)
2. \( A = S + 5 \) (Alex has caught 5 more than Stan)
3. \( S = 4D - 13 \) (Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times what Adelwolfe has caught)

We can substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( S \) in terms of \( D \) into the first equation.

First, substitute \( A \) from the second equation into the first equation:

\[
(S + 5) + S + D = 339
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2S + D + 5 = 339
\]

Subtracting 5 from both sides gives:

\[
2S + D = 334 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]

Next, substitute \( S \) from the third equation into Equation 1:

\[
2(4D - 13) + D = 334
\]

Expanding this gives:

\[
8D - 26 + D = 334
\]

Combining like terms results in:

\[
9D - 26 = 334
\]

Adding 26 to both sides:

\[
9D = 360
\]

Dividing by 9:

\[
D = 40
\]

Now that we have \( D \), we can find \( S \) using the equation \( S = 4D - 13 \):

\[
S = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
\]

Finally, we can find \( A \) using \( A = S + 5 \):

\[
A = 147 + 5 = 152
\]

Now we can verify our solution by checking the total:

\[
A + S + D = 152 + 147 + 40 = 339

This confirms our calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of Pokemon Stan has caught is:

gsm8k,gsm8k-979,TrustRoute-NoRep,3,"Let's denote Emil's current age as \( E = 19 \) years. 

When Emil turns 24, he will be \( 24 \) years old. This will happen in \( 24 - 19 = 5 \) years.

Let \( D \) be the current age of Emil's dad and \( B \) be the current age of Emil's brother.

According to the problem, when Emil is 24:
- He will be half the age of his dad: 
  \[
  24 = \frac{D + 5}{2}
  \]
  Multiplying both sides by 2 gives:
  \[
  48 = D + 5
  \]
  Thus, we can solve for \( D \):
  \[
  D = 48 - 5 = 43
  \]

- He will be twice as old as his brother:
  \[
  24 = 2(B + 5)
  \]
  Dividing both sides by 2 gives:
  \[

\text{Percentage for each adult} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100\%
\]

Simplifying this gives:

\[
\text{Percentage for each adult} = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100\% = 25\%

gsm8k,gsm8k-1030,TrustRoute-NoRep,3,"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we can break down the problem into different scenarios based on the information provided.

1. **Chance of having a substitute teacher**: There is a 50% chance that Marcus will have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework. This means there is a 50% chance that he will have to turn in his homework if the normal teacher comes.

2. **Chance of having the normal teacher**: If the normal teacher comes (50% chance), there is a 40% chance she will give everyone an extension. This means there is a 60% chance that she will not give an extension and will collect the homework.

3. **Chance of convincing the teacher**: If the normal teacher does not give an extension (60% chance), there is a 20% chance that Marcus can convince her that his dog ate his homework and get a personal extension. This means there is an 80% chance that he will have to turn in his homework.

Now, let's calculate the total probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework.

- **Case 1**: Substitute teacher (50% chance)
  - Probability of having to turn in homework = 0%

- **Case 2**: Normal teacher (50% chance)
  - Probability of not giving an extension = 60%
  - Probability of having to turn in homework if no extension is given = 80%
  
  Therefore, the probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework when the normal teacher is present is:
  
  \[
  P(\text{Normal Teacher}) \times P(\text{No Extension}) \times P(\text{No Convincing}) = 0.5 \times 0.6 \times 0.8
  \]

Calculating this:

\[
0.5 \times 0.6 = 0.3
\]
\[
0.3 \times 0.8 = 0.24
\]

So, the total probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework is:

- From Case 1: 0% (substitute teacher)
- From Case 2: 24% (normal teacher and no extension)

Thus, the total probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework is:

\[
0\% + 24\% = 24\%

     \[
     \frac{3}{8} \text{ days} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 3 \text{ hours/day}

gsm8k,gsm8k-1047,TrustRoute-NoRep,3,"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:

- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls (four more than in the second set).
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls (half as many as in the second set).

The total number of tennis balls retrieved in all three sets is given as 19. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Now, let's simplify this equation step by step:

1. Combine like terms:
   \[
   2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
   \]

2. To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 2:
   \[
   2(2x + 4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2 \cdot 19
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   4x + 8 + x = 38
   \]

3. Combine the \( x \) terms:
   \[
   5x + 8 = 38
   \]

4. Subtract 8 from both sides:
   \[
   5x = 30
   \]

5. Divide by 5:
   \[
   x = 6
   \]

Now that we have \( x \), we can find the number of tennis balls retrieved in each set:

- Second set: \( x = 6 \)
- First set: \( x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \)
- Third set: \( \frac{x}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \)

Finally, let's verify the total:
\[
10 + 6 + 3 = 19
\]

Thus, the calculations are correct. Rory retrieved **10 tennis balls** in the first set of the match.",0.003943250000000001,17.148654460906982,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,

\[
P = P_0 \times (1 - r)^t
\]

where:
- \( P \) is the price of the car after \( t \) years,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price of the car,
- \( r \) is the depreciation rate (as a decimal),
- \( t \) is the number of years since the purchase.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 20000 \) (the initial price of the car),
- \( r = 0.21 \) (the depreciation rate of 21%),
- \( t = 2010 - 2007 = 3 \) (the number of years from 2007 to 2010).

Since the total amount of fence is 100 feet, we can set up the following equation:

\[
S + H = 100
\]

Substituting \( H \) with \( S + 60 \):

\[
S + (S + 60) = 100

This simplifies to:

From the information given, we can set up the following equations:

1. The total number of eggs painted by Camden and Sarah:

According to the problem, if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \). Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[

gsm8k,gsm8k-1137,TrustRoute-NoRep,3,"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water, we can set up an equation based on the concept of mixing temperatures.

Let \( T \) be the temperature of the second mug of water (in degrees). 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug, the total volume of water in the bottle is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) ounces. 

The total heat content of the water in the bottle can be calculated as follows:

1. The heat content from the 4 ounces of 33-degree water:
   \[
   \text{Heat from 33-degree water} = 4 \, \text{oz} \times 33 \, \text{degrees} = 132 \, \text{degree-ounces}
   \]

2. The heat content from the 1 ounce of water at temperature \( T \):
   \[
   \text{Heat from second mug} = 1 \, \text{oz} \times T \, \text{degrees} = T \, \text{degree-ounces}
   \]

The total heat content of the mixed water is:
\[
132 + T \, \text{degree-ounces}
\]

The average temperature of the mixed water can be calculated by dividing the total heat content by the total volume:
\[
\text{Average temperature} = \frac{132 + T}{5}
\]

For Donny to be able to drink the water, this average temperature must be at least 40 degrees:
\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Now, we can solve this inequality for \( T \):
1. Multiply both sides by 5:
   \[
   132 + T \geq 200
   \]

2. Subtract 132 from both sides:
   \[
   T \geq 200 - 132

   \[
   T \geq 68

Thus, the minimum temperature of the second mug of water must be at least **68 degrees** for Donny to be able to drink the water.",0.00319825,18.836772441864014,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,

- Let \( r \) be the length of the red rope.
- Let \( b \) be the length of the blue rope.
- Let \( y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope:
   \[
   r = 4b
   \]

2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope:
   \[
   b = y - 7
   \]

3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters:
   \[
   r + b + y = 37
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( r \) and \( b \) into the combined length equation.

Substituting \( r = 4b \) into the combined length equation:
\[
4b + b + y = 37
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
5b + y = 37
\]

Next, we can substitute \( b = y - 7 \) into this equation. Replacing \( y \) with \( b + 7 \):
\[
5b + (b + 7) = 37
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
5b + b + 7 = 37
\]
\[
6b + 7 = 37
\]

Now, subtract 7 from both sides:
\[
6b = 30
\]

Dividing both sides by 6 gives:
\[
b = 5
\]

Now that we have the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the yellow rope using \( b = y - 7 \):
\[
5 = y - 7
\]
\[
y = 12
\]

Now, we can find the length of the red rope using \( r = 4b \):

gsm8k,gsm8k-1181,TrustRoute-NoRep,3,"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information that we can translate into equations:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now:
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7)
   \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now:
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
   \]

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

Let's solve these equations step by step.

First, we can express \( W \) from the first equation:
\[
W = 5C + 35
\]

Now, substitute this expression for \( W \) into the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35)
\]

Now, multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5C + 35
\]
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

Next, rearrange the equation to isolate \( C \):
\[
75 - 35 = 5C - 3C
\]
\[
40 = 2C
\]
\[
C = 20
\]

Now that we have Colin's current age, we can find Wendy's current age using the first equation:
\[
W = 5(C + 7) = 5(20 + 7) = 5 \times 27 = 135
\]

Thus, Colin's current age is:
\[
\boxed{20}

gsm8k,gsm8k-1227,TrustRoute-NoRep,3,"To find out how many magazines Susan gets every year, we need to calculate the total number of issues from each magazine type she subscribes to.

1. **First type of magazine**: Susan orders 3 magazines that each send 12 issues a year.
   - Total issues from these magazines: \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \) issues.

2. **Second type of magazine**: She has 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year.
   - Total issues from this magazine: \( 1 \times 6 = 6 \) issues.

- Let \( S \) be the number of paintings Samantha has.
- Let \( H \) be the number of paintings Shelley has.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley:
   \[
   S = H - 12
   \]

2. Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim:

The total distance Phineas needs to cover is 200 yards. Since half of this distance is on land and the other half is in water, we can calculate the distances as follows:

- Distance on land: \( \frac{200 \text{ yards}}{2} = 100 \text{ yards} \)
- Distance in water: \( \frac{200 \text{ yards}}{2} = 100 \text{ yards} \)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to travel each segment of the journey.

1. **Time to hop on land:**
   - Speed on land = 20 yards per minute
   - Distance on land = 100 yards
   - Time on land = \( \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \)

2. **Time to swim in water:**
   - Speed in water = 10 yards per minute
   - Distance in water = 100 yards
   - Time in water = \( \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards/minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \)

   - Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, his speed is \( 2v \).

2. **Distance run**:
   - We know that Vanessa ran 4 miles.
   - Let’s denote the distance Aaron ran as \( d_A \).

3. **Time taken by Aaron**:
   - Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. 
   - The distance he ran can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     d_A = \text{speed} \times \text{time} = 2v \times 16
     \]
   - Therefore, \( d_A = 32v \).

4. **Distance relationship**:
   - The problem states that Vanessa was able to run twice as far as Aaron did. Thus, we have:
     \[
     4 = 2 \times d_A
     \]
   - Substituting \( d_A \) from the previous step:

1. **Dora's Current Age**: 
   - Dora will turn 12 in 3 years. Therefore, her current age is:
     \[
     12 - 3 = 9 \text{ years old}
     \]

2. **James's Current Age**: 
   - We know that James is currently twice as old as Dora. Therefore, James's current age is:
     \[
     2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ years old}
     \]

3. **John's Age**: 
   - John had James when he was 19. Since James is currently 18, John’s current age is:
     \[
     19 + 18 = 37 \text{ years old}
     \]

4. **John's Youngest Son's Age**: 
   - John had his youngest son when he was 32. Therefore, the age of John's youngest son is:
     \[
     37 - 32 = 5 \text{ years old}
     \]

5. **Youngest Son's Age in 3 Years**: 
   - In 3 years, John's youngest son will be:
     \[
     5 + 3 = 8 \text{ years old}
     \]

Thus, John's youngest son will be **8 years old in 3 years**.",0.00263235,13.74843692779541,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_confidence,
gsm8k,gsm8k-1315,TrustRoute-NoRep,3,"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we first need to calculate how many oranges each person can peel in that time.

1. **Calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour:**
   - Ana takes 3 minutes to peel one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - The number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour is:
     \[
     \text{Oranges peeled by Ana} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour:**
   - Jane takes 4 minutes to peel one orange.
   - The number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour is:
     \[
     \text{Oranges peeled by Jane} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges}
     \]

3. **Calculate the difference in the number of oranges peeled:**
   - The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Oranges peeled by Ana} - \text{Oranges peeled by Jane} = 20 - 15 = 5
     \]

Thus, after one hour, Ana will have peeled **5 more oranges** than Jane.",0.00204925,9.458520889282227,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,

1. **Cost of the new radiator:**
   - Original cost of the radiator: $400
   - Discount: 80% off
   - Amount of discount: \( 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \)
   - Cost after discount: \( 400 - 320 = 80 \)

2. **Cost of hiring the mechanic:**
   - Hourly rate: $50
   - Time taken: 3 hours
   - Total cost for installation: \( 50 \times 3 = 150 \)

3. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of radiator + Cost of installation
   - Total cost = \( 80 + 150 = 230 \)

Therefore, Mark paid a total of **$230**.",0.00169835,10.408307075500488,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_confidence,
gsm8k,gsm8k-1317,TrustRoute-NoRep,3,"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( W \).

We have two equations based on the information provided:

1. The total number of animals:
   \[
   C + W = 20
   \]

2. The total number of legs:
   \[
   2C + 4W = 70
   \]

Now, we can solve these equations step by step.

From the first equation, we can express \( W \) in terms of \( C \):
\[
W = 20 - C
\]

Next, we can substitute \( W \) into the second equation:
\[
2C + 4(20 - C) = 70
\]

Now, simplify the equation:
\[
2C + 80 - 4C = 70
\]
\[
80 - 2C = 70
\]

Now, isolate \( C \):
\[
-2C = 70 - 80
\]
\[
-2C = -10
\]
\[
C = 5
\]

Now that we have \( C \), we can find \( W \):
\[
W = 20 - C = 20 - 5 = 15
\]

Thus, the number of chickens is \( \boxed{5} \).",0.0027976500000000005,10.0104079246521,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_confidence,

1. **Calculate the total number of slices:**
   - Each pizza has 8 slices.
   - There are 7 pizzas.
   - Total slices = 7 pizzas × 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices.

2. **Determine the number of people sharing the pizzas:**
   - Henry and his 3 friends make a total of 4 people.

3. **Calculate the number of slices per person:**
   - Total slices = 56 slices.
   - Number of people = 4.
   - Slices per person = Total slices / Number of people = 56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person.
