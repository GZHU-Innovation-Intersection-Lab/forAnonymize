1. **Calculate the total score needed for an average of 93**:
   Since the lowest score will be dropped, we will be averaging the top 5 scores. To find the total score needed for an average of 93 over 5 tests, we can use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Total needed} = \text{Average} \times \text{Number of tests}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total needed} = 93 \times 5 = 465
   \]

2. **Calculate the sum of the first five test scores**:
   Brinley's scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. We can calculate the sum:
   \[
   \text{Sum of scores} = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438
   \]

3. **Determine the score needed on the sixth test**:
   Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test. After dropping the lowest score, we want the sum of the highest 5 scores (which includes \( x \)) to equal 465. The lowest score among the first five tests is 71, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   438 + x - 71 = 465

1. **Cost of the jacket**: $30
2. **Cost of 2 pairs of shoes**: 2 pairs × $20/pair = $40

Now, we can find the total cost:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of jacket} + \text{Cost of shoes} = 30 + 40 = 70
\]

Next, we need to calculate how much money Sara has after babysitting and how much she needs to earn from mowing the lawn.

3. **Earnings from babysitting**: She babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time.

\[
\text{Total earnings from babysitting} = 4 \times 5 = 20
\]

4. **Total money Sara has before mowing the lawn**: She already had $10 saved.

\[
\text{Total money before mowing} = \text{Savings} + \text{Earnings from babysitting} = 10 + 20 = 30
\]

Now, we can find out how much more money she needs to reach the total cost of $70:

1. The total number of eggs produced by the chickens is given by:
   \[
   3r + 5w = 42
   \]

2. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens:
   \[
   w = r + 2
   \]

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation. Replacing \( w \) in the egg production equation gives us:
\[
3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
\]

Expanding this equation:
\[
3r + 5r + 10 = 42
\]

Combining like terms:
\[
8r + 10 = 42
\]

Next, we isolate \( r \) by subtracting 10 from both sides:
\[
8r = 32
\]

Now, divide both sides by 8:
\[
r = 4

- Naomi's score: \( N = 68 \)
- Yuri's score: \( Y \)
- Brianna's score: \( B \)
- Jojo's score: \( J \)

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points:
   \[
   Y = \frac{N}{2} + 10
   \]
   Substituting \( N = 68 \):
   \[
   Y = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]

2. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi:
   \[
   B = N + 17
   \]
   Substituting \( N = 68 \):
   \[
   B = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]

Now we can find the total score of all four students:
\[
N + Y + B + J = 251

Substituting the known values:
\[
68 + 44 + 85 + J = 251

Calculating the sum of Naomi's, Yuri's, and Brianna's scores:
\[
68 + 44 + 85 = 197

Now we can substitute this back into the equation:
\[
197 + J = 251

To find Jojo's score, we subtract 197 from 251:
\[
J = 251 - 197 = 54

   R = 6S
   \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
   \[
   R + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation. 

Substituting \( R = 6S \) into the second equation gives us:
\[
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
\]

Now, let's simplify the right side:
\[
6S + 9 = 3S + 27
\]

Next, we can isolate \( S \) by moving \( 3S \) to the left side:
\[
6S - 3S + 9 = 27
\]
\[
3S + 9 = 27
\]

Now, subtract 9 from both sides:

gsm8k,gsm8k-303,TrustRoute-NoParallel,2,"To find out how much money Elise earned in the second year, we need to first determine how many books she sold in each year.

1. **Total Books**: Elise started with 250 books.
2. **Unsold Books**: Currently, there are 50 unsold books.
3. **Books Sold This Year**: Elise sold 45 books this year.

From the total number of books and the unsold books, we can calculate the total number of books sold over the three years:

\[
\text{Total Books Sold} = \text{Total Books} - \text{Unsold Books} = 250 - 50 = 200
\]

Let \( x \) be the number of books sold this year (which is 45), and let \( y \) be the number of books sold in the second year. According to the problem, she sold twice as many books in the first year as she sold this year. Therefore, the number of books sold in the first year is:

\[
\text{Books Sold in First Year} = 2x = 2 \times 45 = 90
\]

Now we can set up the equation for the total books sold over the three years:

\[
\text{Books Sold in First Year} + \text{Books Sold in Second Year} + \text{Books Sold This Year} = 200
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
90 + y + 45 = 200
\]

Now, simplify the equation:

\[
135 + y = 200
\]

Subtract 135 from both sides:

\[
y = 200 - 135 = 65
\]

So, Elise sold 65 books in the second year.

Next, we calculate the total amount of money she earned in the second year. Each book sells for $20, so:

\[
\text{Earnings in Second Year} = \text{Books Sold in Second Year} \times \text{Price per Book} = 65 \times 20
\]

Calculating that gives:

\[
\text{Earnings in Second Year} = 1300

1. Cera's current age \( C = 46 \).
2. Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera.

From the second point, we can express Noah's age six years ago:

- Cera's age six years ago: \( C - 6 = 46 - 6 = 40 \).
- Therefore, Noah's age six years ago: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \).

Now, we can find Noah's current age:

- Noah's current age: \( N = 20 + 6 = 26 \).

Next, we need to find the population of Chile six years ago. According to the problem, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time:

- Population of Chile six years ago: \( 3000 \times 20 = 60000 \).

Now, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now. Let \( P \) be the current population of Chile. Therefore, we have:

\[
\frac{P}{2} = 60000
\]

To find the current population \( P \), we multiply both sides by 2:

According to the problem:

1. The number of players on the offense is \( 2d \) (twice as many as on the defense).
2. The number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{d}{2} \) (half the number of players on the defense).

The total number of members in the team is given as 105. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
d + 2d + \frac{d}{2} = 105
\]

Now, let's simplify the left side of the equation:

\[
d + 2d = 3d
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
3d + \frac{d}{2} = 105
\]

To combine \( 3d \) and \( \frac{d}{2} \), we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 1 and 2 is 2. We can rewrite \( 3d \) as \( \frac{6d}{2} \):

\[
\frac{6d}{2} + \frac{d}{2} = 105
\]

Now, combine the fractions:

\[
\frac{6d + d}{2} = 105
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{7d}{2} = 105
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 2:

\[
7d = 210
\]

Now, divide both sides by 7:

\[
d = 30

Thus, the number of players on the defense is \( \boxed{30} \). 

To verify:

- Players on offense: \( 2d = 2 \times 30 = 60 \)
- Players on special teams: \( \frac{d}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \)

Now, adding them up:

1. **Calculate Jam's total pencils:**
   - Jam has 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils.
   - Let's assume each box contains the same number of pencils. Since we know the total number of pencils Jam has is 26, we can express this as:
     \[
     \text{Total pencils in boxes} + \text{loose pencils} = 26
     \]
   - Therefore, the total number of pencils in the boxes is:
     \[
     \text{Total pencils in boxes} = 26 - 2 = 24

2. **Calculate Meg's total pencils:**
   - Meg has 46 pencils.

3. **Calculate the total number of pencils for both Jam and Meg:**
   \[
   \text{Total pencils} = \text{Jam's pencils} + \text{Meg's pencils} = 26 + 46 = 72
   \]

4. **Determine how many boxes are needed:**
   - We need to know how many pencils fit in each box. Since we don't have that information, let's assume each box can hold a standard number of pencils. A common assumption is that a box can hold 12 pencils (this can vary, but we'll use this for calculation).
   - Now, we can calculate the number of boxes needed:
     \[
     \text{Number of boxes needed} = \frac{\text{Total pencils}}{\text{Pencils per box}} = \frac{72}{12} = 6
     \]

1. **Cooling Effect of Ice Cubes**:
   Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. To find out how many ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we can use the following calculation:

   \[
   \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{\text{Total cooling needed}}{\text{Cooling per ice cube}} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
   \]

2. **Weakening Effect of Ice Cubes**:
   Each ice cube also makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, the total weakening from the 5 ice cubes is:

   \[
   \text{Weakening from ice cubes} = \text{Number of ice cubes} \times \text{Weakening per ice cube} = 5 \times 12 \text{ milliliters} = 60 \text{ milliliters}
   \]

3. **Weakening Effect of Cream**:
   Adding 15 milliliters of cream also weakens the coffee. Since the problem states that any added liquid weakens the coffee, we can assume that the cream contributes an additional weakening of 15 milliliters.

4. **Total Weakening**:
   Now, we can calculate the total weakening of the iced coffee by adding the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:

   \[
   \text{Total weakening} = \text{Weakening from ice cubes} + \text{Weakening from cream} = 60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}

gsm8k,gsm8k-405,TrustRoute-NoParallel,2,"To determine how much Tyson will spend on meat and cheese for the muffaletta sandwiches, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of sandwiches needed**: 
   Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we can find out how many sandwiches are needed for 20 people:
   \[
   \text{Number of sandwiches} = \frac{\text{Total people}}{\text{People served per sandwich}} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \text{ sandwiches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed**:
   Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. Therefore, for 5 sandwiches:
   - Total meat needed = 5 pounds
   - Total cheese needed = 5 pounds

3. **Calculate the cost of the meat**:
   The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound. Thus, for 5 pounds:
   \[
   \text{Cost of meat} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 7.00 \text{ dollars/pound} = 35.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost of the cheese**:
   The cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound. Thus, for 5 pounds:
   \[
   \text{Cost of cheese} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 3.00 \text{ dollars/pound} = 15.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost**:
   Now, we can find the total cost by adding the cost of meat and cheese:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of meat} + \text{Cost of cheese} = 35.00 + 15.00 = 50.00 \text{ dollars}

1. **Initial Amount of Cannolis**: Allan has 40 cannolis.

2. **Initial Amount of Corn**: According to the problem, there is twice as much corn as cannolis. Therefore, the amount of corn is:
   \[
   \text{Corn} = 2 \times \text{Cannolis} = 2 \times 40 = 80
   \]

3. **Total Amount of Cannolis After Purchase**: Allan buys 60 more cannolis. So, the new total of cannolis is:
   \[
   \text{Total Cannolis} = 40 + 60 = 100
   \]

4. **Amount of Corn After Purchase**: Allan buys 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he has now. Since he has 100 cannolis, the amount of corn he has is:
   \[
   \text{Corn} = 100 - 40 = 60

   \]
3. He did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
4. After his jog, he realized he had 2,000 steps left to take.

Now, let's calculate how many steps Elliott had taken before his jog:

- Steps from school: 5,000 steps
- Steps with his friend: 1,000 steps

Adding these together:
\[
\text{Total steps before jog} = 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 \text{ steps}

gsm8k,gsm8k-409,TrustRoute-NoParallel,2,"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we can break it down into two parts: the payments for May and the payments for June.

### Step 1: Calculate the payment for May
- Number of employees hired in May: 40
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per week: 40

The total payment for May can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total payment for May} = \text{Number of employees} \times \text{Hourly wage} \times \text{Hours per week}
\]

\[
\text{Total payment for May} = 40 \times 15 \times 40
\]

\[
\text{Total payment for May} = 40 \times 600 = 24000
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the payment for June
In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. Therefore, the number of employees remaining in June is:

\[
\text{Remaining employees} = 40 - \left(\frac{1}{4} \times 40\right) = 40 - 10 = 30
\]

The total payment for June can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total payment for June} = \text{Remaining employees} \times \text{Hourly wage} \times \text{Hours per week}
\]

\[
\text{Total payment for June} = 30 \times 15 \times 40
\]

\[
\text{Total payment for June} = 30 \times 600 = 18000
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total payment for both months
Now, we can find the total amount paid to employees over the two months:

\[
\text{Total payment for both months} = \text{Total payment for May} + \text{Total payment for June}
\]

\[
\text{Total payment for both months} = 24000 + 18000 = 42000
\]

   - With the promotion, if she buys 1 pound at $3, she gets the second pound at half off. 
   - Half off of $3 is $1.50.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is:
     \[
     3 + 1.50 = 4.50
     \]

2. **Seashells Purchase**:
   - The mixed bag of seashells costs $1.50.

3. **Magnets Purchase**:
   - Each magnet costs $0.25, and she bought 4 magnets.
   - The total cost for the magnets is:
     \[
     4 \times 0.25 = 1.00
     \]

4. **Total Spending**:
   - Now, we can calculate the total amount spent:

According to the problem:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- She gathers half of that from the shortest trees, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
- Therefore, the total number of apples Joanne gathers is:
  \[
  30 + 15 + x = 45 + x
  \]

Now, let's look at her sister's gathering:

- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- She gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- Her sister does not gather any apples from the average trees.

Let:
- \( c \) = number of camels
- \( d \) = number of dromedaries

From the problem, we know:
1. Each animal has one head, so the total number of heads gives us the first equation:
   \[
   c + d = 180
   \]

2. Camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump. The total number of humps gives us the second equation:
   \[
   2c + d = 304
   \]

Now we have the following system of equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)  (Equation 1)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \) (Equation 2)

We can solve this system step by step.

First, we can solve Equation 1 for \( d \):
\[
d = 180 - c
\]

Next, we substitute \( d \) in Equation 2:

\[
c + 180 = 304
\]
\[
c = 304 - 180

   The tattered jeans cost $28.

2. **Determine the cost of the jogger jeans**: 
   The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. Therefore:
   \[
   \text{Cost of jogger jeans} = 28 - 6 = 22 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the original prices of both jeans**: 
   - Tattered jeans: $28
   - Jogger jeans: $22

4. **Total cost of both jeans**:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 28 + 22 = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Total savings**: 
   Cole saved a total of $6.

6. **Distribution of savings**:
   He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. 
   - Savings from jogger jeans:
   \[
   \text{Savings from jogger jeans} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   - Savings from tattered jeans:
   \[
   \text{Savings from tattered jeans} = 6 - 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Determine the original prices before savings**:
   - If he saved $2 on the jogger jeans, the original price of the jogger jeans before the discount was:
   \[
   22 + 2 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   - If he saved $4 on the tattered jeans, the original price of the tattered jeans before the discount was:
   \[
   28 + 4 = 32 \text{ dollars}
   \]

8. **Calculate the difference in original prices**:
   The original price of the jogger jeans is $24, and the original price of the tattered jeans is $32. Now, we find how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 32 - 24 = 8 \text{ dollars}

1. **Initial Preparation**: The caterer was told to prepare gourmet hot dogs for 36 guests. He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hot dogs. 

   - Half of 36 guests is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) guests.
   - If these 18 guests each have 2 hot dogs, the total number of hot dogs prepared is:
     \[
     18 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs/guest} = 36 \text{ hot dogs}

2. **Guests Who Showed Up**: However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hot dog.

3. **Total Hot Dogs Needed**: If all 40 guests want a second hot dog, the total number of hot dogs needed is:
   - Each of the 40 guests wants 2 hot dogs, so:

gsm8k,gsm8k-443,TrustRoute-NoParallel,2,"To find out how long it took James to do the run, we first need to calculate Jon's total time for the triathlon and then determine James's total time based on the information given.

1. **Calculate Jon's total time:**
   - Swim: 40 minutes
   - Bike: 1 hour 20 minutes = 80 minutes
   - Run: 50 minutes

   Total time for Jon:
   \[
   \text{Total time for Jon} = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Determine James's swim time:**
   - James swims 10% faster than Jon. 
   - Jon's swim time is 40 minutes. 
   - 10% of 40 minutes is:
   \[
   0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   - Therefore, James's swim time is:
   \[
   40 - 4 = 36 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Determine James's bike time:**
   - James takes 5 minutes longer than Jon on the bike.
   - Jon's bike time is 80 minutes.
   - Therefore, James's bike time is:
   \[
   80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Calculate James's total time so far:**
   - Total time for James (without the run):
   \[
   \text{Total time for James (swim + bike)} = 36 + 85 = 121 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Determine Jon's total time and the time difference:**
   - Jon won by 10 minutes, so James's total time is:
   \[
   \text{Total time for James} = \text{Total time for Jon} - 10 = 170 - 10 = 160 \text{ minutes}
   \]

6. **Calculate James's run time:**
   - Let \( R \) be James's run time. Then:
   \[
   121 + R = 160
   \]
   - Solving for \( R \):
   \[
   R = 160 - 121 = 39 \text{ minutes}

3. **Total cost without discounts**: 
   - Total cost = 2 packs × $4.00/pack = $8.00.

4. **Buy one get one free offer**:

1. **Heights of the Cheerleaders**:
   - 9 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall.
   - 1 cheerleader is 60 inches tall.

2. **Structure of the Pyramid**:
   - The bottom layer has 4 cheerleaders.
   - The second layer has 3 cheerleaders.
   - The third layer has 2 cheerleaders.
   - The top layer has 1 cheerleader (the shortest one).

3. **Height Calculation**:
   - The bottom layer (4 cheerleaders) will be at the height of the tallest cheerleaders, which is 64 inches.
   - The second layer (3 cheerleaders) will be at the height of the bottom layer plus the height of the cheerleaders in the second layer, which is also 64 inches.
   - The third layer (2 cheerleaders) will be at the height of the second layer plus the height of the cheerleaders in the third layer, which is again 64 inches.
   - The top layer (1 cheerleader) will be at the height of the third layer plus the height of the shortest cheerleader, which is 60 inches.

Now, let's calculate the total height step by step:

- Height of the bottom layer: 64 inches
- Height of the second layer: 64 inches
- Height of the third layer: 64 inches
- Height of the top layer: 60 inches

The total height of the pyramid can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total Height} = \text{Height of bottom layer} + \text{Height of second layer} + \text{Height of third layer} + \text{Height of top layer}

3. **Total rides**: \( 14 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ rides/day} = 28 \text{ rides} \)

Now, we can calculate the total cost for the morning and afternoon rides:

- **Cost of morning rides**:
  - Cost per morning ride: $6
  - Total morning rides: 14 (one for each day)
  - Total cost for morning rides: \( 14 \text{ rides} \times 6 \text{ dollars/ride} = 84 \text{ dollars} \)

2. Lily found 7 more insects than David:
   \[
   L = D + 7

3. David found half of what Bodhi found:
   \[
   D = \frac{1}{2}B

Now we can substitute the expressions for \( L \) and \( D \) into the total equation.

First, substitute \( D \) in terms of \( B \) into the equation for \( L \):
\[
L = \frac{1}{2}B + 7
\]

Now substitute \( L \) and \( D \) into the total equation:
\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}B + 7\right) + \left(\frac{1}{2}B\right) + B = 43
\]

Combine the terms:
\[
\frac{1}{2}B + 7 + \frac{1}{2}B + B = 43

\[

\[

   - Since the 2 x 8 is more efficient, we should prioritize buying as many of those as possible within the $24 budget.

   - The maximum number of 2 x 8 pieces Frederick can buy with $24:
     \[
     \text{Number of 2 x 8 pieces} = \frac{24}{6} = 4
     \]
   - Total cost for 4 pieces of 2 x 8:
     \[
     4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Total number of sticks from 4 pieces of 2 x 8:
     \[
     4 \times 400 = 1600 \text{ sticks}
     \]

3. **Conclusion**:
Since Frederick can buy 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood for $24 and produce 1600 popsicle sticks, the maximum number of popsicle sticks he can make is **1600 sticks**.",0.00026369999999999996,6.491678237915039,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage1_only,

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does.

Now, let's analyze the information step by step:

- The farm has 30 cows.
- Since the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, the zoo has:
  \[
  2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ cows}
  \]

- The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has:
  \[
  \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ sheep}
  \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of animals at both the farm and the zoo:

- Total animals on the farm:
  \[
  30 \text{ cows} + 10 \text{ sheep} = 40 \text{ animals}
  \]

- Total animals at the zoo:
  \[
  60 \text{ cows} + 20 \text{ sheep} = 80 \text{ animals}
  \]

Finally, we combine the total number of animals from both locations:

According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought. We know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Therefore, we can set up the following equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of onions Rose bought is:
   \[
   R_o = 12
   \]
   Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions Sophia bought:
   \[
   R_o = 4 \times S_o
   \]
   Thus, we have:
   \[
   12 = 4 \times S_o
   \]
   Solving for \( S_o \):
   \[
   S_o = \frac{12}{4} = 3
   \]

2. The total number of potatoes Rose bought is:
   \[
   R_p = 4
   \]
   Since Rose bought 4 times the number of potatoes Sophia bought:
   \[
   R_p = 4 \times S_p
   \]
   Thus, we have:
   \[
   4 = 4 \times S_p
   \]
   Solving for \( S_p \):
   \[
   S_p = \frac{4}{4} = 1
   \]

Now, we can find the total number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought:

1. **Calculate the total calories needed to lose 30 lbs.**:
   \[
   \text{Total calories} = \text{Weight to lose (lbs)} \times \text{Calories per pound}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total calories} = 30 \, \text{lbs} \times 3500 \, \text{calories/lb} = 105000 \, \text{calories}

   - February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
   - March: 31 days
   - April: 30 days
   - May: 31 days
   - June: 30 days
   - July: 19 days

   Now, we sum these days:
   \[
   \text{Total days} = 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 =  31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 =  31 + 28 = 59

1. **Determine the rate of one person**: If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then that person can paint a whole house in double that time:
   \[
   \text{Time for one person to paint a whole house} = 5 \text{ days} \times 2 = 10 \text{ days}
   \]

2. **Calculate the rate of work**: The rate of work for one person is:
   \[
   \text{Rate of one person} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} = 0.1 \text{ houses per day}
   \]

3. **Calculate the rate of 5 people**: If 5 people are working together, their combined rate is:
   \[
   \text{Rate of 5 people} = 5 \times 0.1 \text{ houses per day} = 0.5 \text{ houses per day}

gsm8k,gsm8k-528,TrustRoute-NoParallel,2,"Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as \( C_O \) and the number of chairs Jenna has as \( C_J \). 

According to the problem:

1. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs:
   \[
   S_O = C_O - 2
   \]
   where \( S_O \) is the number of sofas Ophelia has.

2. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia:
   \[
   C_J = 3C_O
   \]

3. Ophelia has 20 sofas:
   \[
   S_O = 20
   \]

From the first equation, we can substitute \( S_O \) into the equation for Ophelia's sofas:
\[
20 = C_O - 2
\]
Adding 2 to both sides gives:
\[
C_O = 22
\]

Now we can find the number of chairs Jenna has using the second equation:
\[
C_J = 3C_O = 3 \times 22 = 66
\]

Next, we can find the number of sofas Jenna has. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs:
\[
S_J = C_J - 2 = 66 - 2 = 64
\]

Now we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs for both Ophelia and Jenna.

**Total Sofas:**
\[
S_O + S_J = 20 + 64 = 84
\]

**Total Chairs:**
\[
C_O + C_J = 22 + 66 = 88
\]

**Total Sofas and Chairs:**
\[
\text{Total} = (S_O + S_J) + (C_O + C_J) = 84 + 88 = 172
\]

Thus, the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have is \( \boxed{172} \).",0.00026025,6.728882551193237,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage1_only,

gsm8k,gsm8k-546,TrustRoute-NoParallel,2,"To calculate the total number of letters Elise has written, we can break down her writing process step by step:

1. **Writing the alphabet in full twice**:
   - The alphabet has 26 letters.
   - Writing it in full twice means she writes \( 26 \times 2 = 52 \) letters.

2. **Writing half of the alphabet once**:
   - Half of the alphabet is \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \) letters.
   - So, she writes 13 letters.

3. **Re-writing everything she has already written**:
   - At this point, she has written 52 letters (from the full alphabet written twice) + 13 letters (from half the alphabet) = 65 letters.
   - Now, she rewrites everything she has already written, which means she writes another 65 letters.

Now, we can add all of these together to find the total:

\[
52 \text{ (first two full alphabets)} + 13 \text{ (half alphabet)} + 65 \text{ (rewriting everything)} = 130

   So for these three teeth, the total amount is:
   \[
   1.00 \times 3 = 3.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. For the **last two teeth** (the fifth and sixth teeth), the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as she had received for each of the previous three teeth. Since she received $1.00 for each of the last three teeth, half of that is:
   \[
   \frac{1.00}{2} = 0.50 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Therefore, for these two teeth, the total amount is:
   \[
   0.50 \times 2 = 1.00 \text{ dollar}
   \]

Now, let's sum up all the amounts Sharon received:

- From the first tooth: $5.00
- From the next three teeth: $3.00
- From the last two teeth: $1.00

Adding these amounts together:
\[
5.00 + 3.00 + 1.00 = 9.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is:

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. Richie scored 80 goals.
2. Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark:
   \[
   80 = M + 20
   \]
   From this, we can solve for \( M \):
   \[
   M = 80 - 20 = 60
   \]

3. Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna:
   \[
   80 = A + 45
   \]
   From this, we can solve for \( A \):
   \[
   A = 80 - 45 = 35
   \]

Now we have the number of goals scored by each teenager:
- Richie: 80 goals
- Mark: 60 goals
- Anna: 35 goals

To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add their goals together:
\[

1. **Total Amount of Money**: Peter has $70.

2. **Days in a Week**: There are 7 days in a week.

3. **Daily Spending**: To find out how much Peter can spend each day, we divide his total amount by the number of days in a week:
   \[
   \text{Daily Spending} = \frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day}
   \]

4. **Spending from Sunday through Wednesday**: For the first four days (Sunday to Wednesday), Peter spends his daily allowance on wooden action figures that cost $5 each. The total amount he spends from Sunday to Wednesday is:
   \[
   \text{Total Spending (Sunday to Wednesday)} = 10 \times 4 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Number of Wooden Action Figures**: The number of wooden action figures he buys can be calculated by dividing the total amount spent on wooden figures by their cost:
   \[
   \text{Number of Wooden Action Figures} = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ wooden action figures}
   \]

6. **Spending from Thursday to Saturday**: For the remaining three days (Thursday to Saturday), Peter continues to spend $10 per day, but now he buys plastic action figures that cost $2 each. The total amount he spends from Thursday to Saturday is:
   \[
   \text{Total Spending (Thursday to Saturday)} = 10 \times 3 = 30 \text{ dollars}

1. **Calories burned during aerobics**:
   - Duration: 2 hours
   - Calories burned per hour: 500 calories
   - Total calories burned from aerobics = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories

2. **Calories burned while running**:

According to the problem:
- The number of red jelly beans is \( r = b - 0.01b = 0.99b \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( g = b + 0.01b = 1.01b \).

The total number of jelly beans in the jar is given as 4500, so we can set up the equation:

\[
r + b + g = 4500
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( r \) and \( g \):

\[
0.99b + b + 1.01b = 4500
\]

Combining the terms:

\[
(0.99 + 1 + 1.01)b = 4500
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
3.01b = 4500
\]

Now, we can solve for \( b \):

\[
b = \frac{4500}{3.01} \approx 1498.34
\]

Now we can find \( r \) and \( g \):

\[
r = 0.99b \approx 0.99 \times 1498.34 \approx 1483.84
\]
\[
g = 1.01b \approx 1.01 \times 1498.34 \approx 1516.16

Next, we need to find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans:

\[
g - r = 1516.16 - 1483.84 = 32.32
\]

Since the number of jelly beans must be a whole number, we round to the nearest whole number. Thus, the difference in the number of jelly beans is approximately:

\[

3. **Growth pattern**: The beanstalk doubles its height every day.

We can express the height of the beanstalk after \( n \) days with the formula:

gsm8k,gsm8k-606,TrustRoute-NoParallel,2,"To find out how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of rotations the tires undergo in a month:**
   - The car drives 400 miles a month.
   - The tires rotate 725 times for every 2 miles.
   - First, we find out how many 2-mile segments are in 400 miles:
     \[
     \text{Number of 2-mile segments} = \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/segment}} = 200 \text{ segments}
     \]
   - Now, we calculate the total rotations in a month:
     \[
     \text{Total rotations in a month} = 200 \text{ segments} \times 725 \text{ rotations/segment} = 145,000 \text{ rotations}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of rotations in a year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year, so:
     \[
     \text{Total rotations in a year} = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}
     \]

3. **Determine how many years the tires can last before needing replacement:**
   - Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations. To find the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced, we divide the total rotations a tire can handle by the number of rotations per year:
     \[
     \text{Years before replacement} = \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} \approx 6 \text{ years}

1. **Determine the total number of washes Jackie can get from the jumbo bottle**:
   - The directions say that 2 pumps provide 120 washes. Therefore, if Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, she will get:
     \[
     \text{Number of washes} = \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{2 \text{ pumps}} \times 1 \text{ pump} = 120 \text{ washes}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost per wash**:
   - The total cost of the jumbo bottle is $24.00. To find the cost per wash, we divide the total cost by the number of washes:
     \[
     \text{Cost per wash} = \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washes}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per wash}

gsm8k,gsm8k-611,TrustRoute-NoParallel,2,"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we can break it down into two parts: the initial funding for the first 5 months and the funding for the additional months.

1. **Initial Funding for the First 5 Months:**
   - The initial funding is $100,000 for the first 5 months.
   - Monthly funding for the first 5 months = \( \frac{100,000}{5} = 20,000 \) per month.

2. **Total Duration of Research:**
   - The research took 10 times longer than initially planned.
   - Total duration = \( 5 \text{ months} \times 10 = 50 \text{ months} \).

3. **Additional Months of Research:**
   - Additional months = \( 50 - 5 = 45 \text{ months} \).

4. **Funding for the Additional Months:**
   - The funding for each of the additional months increases by 50% compared to the previous month.
   - The funding for the 6th month = \( 20,000 \times 1.5 = 30,000 \).
   - The funding for the 7th month = \( 30,000 \times 1.5 = 45,000 \).
   - The funding for the 8th month = \( 45,000 \times 1.5 = 67,500 \).
   - This pattern continues for 45 months.

   The funding for the \( n \)-th month can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Funding for month } n = 20,000 \times (1.5)^{(n-1)}
   \]

5. **Total Funding for the Additional 45 Months:**
   - We need to sum the funding from the 6th month to the 50th month:
   \[
   \text{Total funding for additional months} = \sum_{n=6}^{50} 20,000 \times (1.5)^{(n-1)}
   \]

   This is a geometric series where:
   - First term \( a = 20,000 \times (1.5)^{5} \) (for the 6th month)
   - Common ratio \( r = 1.5 \)
   - Number of terms \( n = 45 \)

   The sum of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}
   \]

   Plugging in the values:
   - First term \( a = 20,000 \times (1.5)^{5} = 20,000 \times 7.59375 = 151,875 \)
   - Common ratio \( r = 1.5 \)
   - Number of terms \( n = 45 \)

   Now we can calculate the total funding for the additional months:
   \[
   S_{45} = 151,875 \frac{1 - (1.5)^{45}}{1 - 1.5}
   \]
   \[
   S_{45} = 151,875 \frac{1 - (1.5)^{45}}{-0.5}
   \]
   \[
   S_{45} = -303,750 \left(1 - (1.5)^{45}\right)
   \]

   Now, calculating \( (1.5)^{45} \):
   \[
   (1.5)^{45} \approx 1.5^{45} \approx 7.62939453125 \times 10^{8} \text{ (using a calculator)}
   \]
   \[
   S_{45} \approx -303,750 \left(1 - 7.62939453125 \times 10^{8}\right)
   \]
   \[
   S_{45} \approx -303,750 \times (-7.62939453125 \times 10^{8}) \approx 2.314 \times 10^{14}
   \]

6. **Total Cost of Research:**
   - Total cost = Initial funding + Additional funding
   - Total cost = $100,000 + Total funding for additional months.

   Since the additional funding is significantly larger than the initial funding, the total cost will be dominated by the additional funding.

Thus, the total cost of John's research is approximately **$2.314 \times 10^{14}**.",0.0005899499999999999,14.634809494018555,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage1_only,

gsm8k,gsm8k-625,TrustRoute-NoParallel,2,"To find out how many flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed, we first need to calculate the total number of flowers she has planted.

Arianna has 10 rows of flowers, with 20 flowers in each row. Therefore, the total number of flowers is:

\[
\text{Total flowers} = \text{Number of rows} \times \text{Flowers per row} = 10 \times 20 = 200
\]

Next, we know that \( \frac{4}{5} \) of the planted flowers have bloomed. To find the number of flowers that have bloomed, we calculate:

\[
\text{Bloomed flowers} = \frac{4}{5} \times \text{Total flowers} = \frac{4}{5} \times 200

gsm8k,gsm8k-635,TrustRoute-NoParallel,2,"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we first need to calculate the maximum total cost per class that his parents are willing to pay.

Manny's total cost for the Karate classes is $60, and he has signed up for 10 classes. Therefore, the cost per class is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Cost per class} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of classes}} = \frac{60}{10} = 6
\]

Since the cost per class is $6, Manny's parents are willing to pay up to $10 per class. This means he can miss some classes as long as the average cost per class does not exceed $10.

Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny misses. The number of classes he actually attends will then be \( 10 - x \).

The total cost remains $60, and the average cost per class based on the number of classes attended is:

\[
\text{Average cost per class} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of classes attended}} = \frac{60}{10 - x}
\]

To find the maximum number of classes he can miss, we set up the inequality:

\[
\frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10
\]

Now, we solve this inequality step by step:

1. Multiply both sides by \( 10 - x \) (note that \( 10 - x \) must be positive, so \( x < 10 \)):
   \[
   60 \leq 10(10 - x)
   \]

2. Distribute the right side:
   \[
   60 \leq 100 - 10x
   \]

3. Rearranging gives:
   \[
   10x \leq 100 - 60
   \]
   \[
   10x \leq 40
   \]

4. Dividing both sides by 10:
   \[
   x \leq 4

Thus, Manny can miss up to 4 classes. If he misses more than 4 classes, the average cost per class will exceed $10, and his parents will not sign him up again.

Let:
- \( s \) = number of sheep
- \( g \) = number of geese

From the problem, we know:
1. Each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs. The total number of legs is 70.
   \[
   4s + 2g = 70
   \]
   
2. Each animal has 1 head. The total number of heads is 20.
   \[
   s + g = 20
   \]

Now we have the following system of equations:
1. \( 4s + 2g = 70 \)
2. \( s + g = 20 \)

We can solve this system step by step.

First, we can simplify the first equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[
2s + g = 35
\]

Now we have:
1. \( 2s + g = 35 \)
2. \( s + g = 20 \)

Next, we can subtract the second equation from the first:
\[
(2s + g) - (s + g) = 35 - 20
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
s = 15
\]

Now that we have \( s \), we can find \( g \) using the second equation:
\[
s + g = 20
\]
Substituting \( s = 15 \):
\[
15 + g = 20
\]
\[
g = 20 - 15 = 5

Thus, the number of sheep \( s \) is 15 and the number of geese \( g \) is 5.

4. **Neutral Days**: The remaining days are neutral. 

First, we can calculate the number of neutral days:

\[
\text{Neutral Days} = \text{Total Days} - (\text{Good Days} + \text{Bad Days}) = 30 - (12 + 8) = 30 - 20 = 10

Now, let's analyze the distribution of her moods over the first 24 days:

- **First 8 Days**: All good days (8 good days)
- **Second 8 Days**: All bad days (8 bad days)
- **Third 8 Days**: All neutral days (8 neutral days)

So far, we have:

- Good Days: 8 (from the first 8 days)
- Bad Days: 8 (from the second 8 days)
- Neutral Days: 8 (from the third 8 days)

Next, we consider the next 3 days, which are recorded as follows:

From the problem, we know:

1. \( K = M - 5 \)
2. \( M = C + 12 \)
3. \( S = M + 23 \)
4. \( K = 68 \)

Since \( K = 68 \), we can substitute this value into the first equation:

1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet. We can express this as:
   \[
   T = R + 7
   \]
   where \( R \) is the age of the triplet that is younger than the twin.

2. The combined ages of the twins and triplets is 44. Since there are two twins and three triplets, we can express this as:
   \[
   2T + 3R = 44
   \]

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation. From \( T = R + 7 \), we can express \( 2T \) as:
\[
2T = 2(R + 7) = 2R + 14
\]

Now, substituting \( 2T \) into the combined ages equation:
\[
2R + 14 + 3R = 44

gsm8k,gsm8k-705,TrustRoute-NoParallel,2,"To find out how many feet Martha's turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we first need to determine the speed of the turtle.

Given that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle and the cat's speed is 15 feet/second, we can set up the following equation:

Let \( v \) be the speed of the turtle in feet/second. According to the problem:

\[
5v = 15
\]

Now, we can solve for \( v \):

\[
v = \frac{15}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second}
\]

Now that we know the turtle's speed is 3 feet/second, we can calculate how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds:

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

1. **Calculate the amount still needed to reach the goal:**
   \[
   \text{Amount needed} = \text{Goal} - \text{Amount raised}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Amount needed} = 6300 - 2100 = 4200

2. **Determine the amount raised per hour:**
   Since they raised $2100 in the first 3 hours, we can find the hourly rate:
   \[
   \text{Amount raised per hour} = \frac{\text{Amount raised}}{\text{Hours}} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700

1. **Determine the percentage of the river's water used by Colorado City**: 
   Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.

2. **Determine the percentage of that water used for industrial purposes**: 
   Out of the 40% used by the city, 80% is for industrial purposes.

3. **Calculate the percentage of the river's total water used for industrial purposes**:

2. **Time taken by the dog**:
   - The dog takes \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the time the cat takes.
   - Time taken by the dog = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \) minutes = \( 20 \) minutes.

3. **Average time**:

gsm8k,gsm8k-726,TrustRoute-NoParallel,2,"To solve the problem, we first need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches.

Topher's shoe length is 8 feet and 4 inches. We convert this to inches:

1 foot = 12 inches, so:
\[ 
8 \text{ feet} = 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ inches} 
\]
Adding the 4 inches:
\[ 
96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} 
\]

Now we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches.

According to the problem, the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

Let \( b \) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. Then we have:
\[ 
100 = 9b + 10 
\]

Now, we will solve for \( b \):

1. Subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 
100 - 10 = 9b 
\]
\[ 
90 = 9b 
\]

2. Divide both sides by 9:
\[ 
b = \frac{90}{9}

\[ 
b = 10

   \text{Total Cost} = 3 \times 1800 = 5400 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total value of the cards he obtained:**
   - He has one card worth $4000.
   - He has another card worth $1000.
   - He has 30 more cards worth an average of $50 each.
   \[
   \text{Value of 30 cards} = 30 \times 50 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Now, we can sum up the values of all the cards:
   \[

1. Calculate the size of each group:
   \[

2. Now, if the activity requires 12 groups, we need to find out how many students would be in each of those groups:
   \[
   \text{Size of each group with 12 groups} = \frac{54 \text{ students}}{12 \text{ groups}} = 4.5 \text{ students per group}

   Since you cannot have half a student, it is not feasible to form 12 groups with 54 students.

3. To find out how many more groups are needed to accommodate all students in groups of equal size, we can calculate how many groups can be formed with the current number of students:
   - If we want to keep the group size at 9 students (as calculated from the 6 groups), we can only form 6 groups.
   - If we want to form 12 groups, we would need:
   \[
   12 \text{ groups} \times 9 \text{ students per group} = 108 \text{ students}

   This means we need 108 students to form 12 groups of 9 students each.

4. Since we only have 54 students, we cannot form 12 groups with 9 students each. Therefore, we need to determine how many groups we can actually form with the 54 students:
   \[

   - Lorraine starts with:
     - Small stickers: 30
     - Large stickers: 40

2. **Trading Small Stickers**:
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = \( 0.9 \times 30 = 27 \) small stickers.
   - Since each large sticker is worth 1 large button or 3 small buttons, trading 27 small stickers gives her:

3. The third house needs double what the first house needs:

Now, we can substitute \( x \) and \( z \) in terms of \( y \) into the first equation.

From the second equation, we can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):

Substituting \( y \) into the first equation:

   \text{Number of pears} = \text{Number of bananas} + 0.45 \times \text{Number of bananas}
   \]

   Substituting the number of bananas:

   \[
   \text{Number of pears} = 200 + 0.45 \times 200
   \]

   Calculate \(0.45 \times 200\):

   \[
   0.45 \times 200 = 90
   \]

   Now, add this to the number of bananas:

   \[
   \text{Number of pears} = 200 + 90 = 290
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of fruits:**
   Now, we add the number of bananas and pears together to find the total number of fruits:

   \[
   \text{Total fruits} = \text{Number of bananas} + \text{Number of pears}
   \]

   Substituting the values we have:

   \[
   \text{Total fruits} = 200 + 290 = 490

1. **Books read by Ezra**: Ezra has read 300 books this hour.
2. **Books read by Ahmed**: Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can find out how many books Ahmed read. Let \( A \) be the number of books Ahmed read. According to the problem:
   \[
   300 = 2A
   \]
   To find \( A \), we divide both sides by 2:

1. **Driving Speed and Time**:
   - The average driving speed is 50 miles per hour.
   - The total time for the trip is 6 hours, and they spent 1.5 hours hiking. Therefore, the time spent driving is:
     \[
     \text{Time driving} = \text{Total time} - \text{Time hiking} = 6 \text{ hours} - 1.5 \text{ hours} = 4.5 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Distance Driven**:
   - The distance driven can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
     \]
   - Thus, the distance driven is:
     \[
     \text{Distance driven} = 50 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4.5 \text{ hours} = 225 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Hiking Speed**:
   - The hiking speed is given as 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of the driving speed is:
     \[
     \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ miles/hour}
     \]
   - Therefore, the hiking speed is:
     \[
     \text{Hiking speed} = 25 \text{ miles/hour} - 5 \text{ miles/hour} = 20 \text{ miles/hour}

From the problem statement, we know:

- Ava jumps on \( E + 8 \) enemies.
- Ava collects \( B + 3 \) berries.
- Ava finishes the level \( T - 4 \) seconds slower than Emma, meaning Ava has \( T - 4 \) seconds left.

Now, we can calculate the scores for both Ava and Emma using the scoring system provided:

**Emma's score:**
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Emma}} = 10E + 5B + 30T
\]

**Ava's score:**
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10(E + 8) + 5(B + 3) + 30(T - 4)
\]

Now, let's expand Ava's score:

\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120
\]
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10E + 5B + 30T - 25
\]

Now we can find the difference between Ava's score and Emma's score:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} - \text{Score}_{\text{Emma}}
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = (10E + 5B + 30T - 25) - (10E + 5B + 30T)
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = -25

Initially, Bob had:
- 3 orange fish
- 4 white fish

After buying the fish, the total number of orange fish becomes \( 3 + x \) and the total number of white fish becomes \( 4 + y \).

According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish. This can be expressed with the equation:

\[
3 + x = 2(4 + y)
\]

Additionally, we know that Bob bought a total of 17 fish:

\[
x + y = 17
\]

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. \( 3 + x = 2(4 + y) \)
2. \( x + y = 17 \)

Let's solve the first equation:

\[
3 + x = 8 + 2y
\]
\[
x - 2y = 5 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]

Now we can use the second equation:

\[
x + y = 17 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\]

From Equation 2, we can express \( x \) in terms of \( y \):

\[
x = 17 - y
\]

Now, substitute \( x \) in Equation 1:

\[
(17 - y) - 2y = 5
\]
\[
17 - 3y = 5
\]
\[
-3y = 5 - 17

\[
-3y = -12

\[
y = 4

Now that we have \( y \), we can find \( x \):

\[
x = 17 - y = 17 - 4 = 13

1. **Third Graders:**
   - Total third graders = 500
   - Passed third graders = 340

2. **Fourth Graders:**
   - Total fourth graders = 100
   - Passed fourth graders = 40

3. **Fifth Graders:**
   - Total fifth graders = 400
   - We need to calculate the pass rate for the fifth graders. The problem states that the pass rate for fifth graders is twice that of the fourth graders.
   - The pass rate for fourth graders = \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.4 \) (or 40%)
   - Therefore, the pass rate for fifth graders = \( 2 \times 0.4 = 0.8 \) (or 80%)
   - Passed fifth graders = \( 0.8 \times 400 = 320 \)

1. **Calculate the total number of branches climbed:**
   Felix charges $0.25 per branch. If he made $105 in total, we can find the total number of branches climbed by dividing the total earnings by the cost per branch:

   \[
   \text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25}

   - DeSean also makes 9 S'mores, using another 9 marshmallows.
   - Total marshmallows used = 9 (John) + 9 (DeSean) = 18 marshmallows.

2. **Account for the marshmallows dropped**:
   - They dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground.

3. **Calculate the total marshmallows accounted for**:
   - Total marshmallows used + marshmallows dropped = 18 + 3 = 21 marshmallows.

4. **Calculate the remaining marshmallows in the bag**:

1. **Jack's playtime**: 
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter.

2. **Two friends' playtime** (who can only play half as long as Jack):
   - Each of these friends can play for \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) minutes with 1 quarter.

3. **One friend's playtime** (who can play 1.5 times as long as Jack):
   - This friend can play for \( 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \) minutes with 1 quarter.

Now, we can summarize the playtimes:
- Jack: 20 minutes
- Friend 1: 10 minutes
- Friend 2: 10 minutes
- Friend 3: 30 minutes

Next, we calculate the total playtime for all four players over the 4 hours they played:

4 hours = 240 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how many quarters are used in total. 

To find out how many quarters each person uses, we divide their total playtime by the time they can play per quarter:

- **Jack**: 
  \[
  \text{Quarters used} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters}
  \]

- **Friend 1**: 
  \[
  \text{Quarters used} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters}
  \]

- **Friend 2**: 
  \[
  \text{Quarters used} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters}
  \]

- **Friend 3**: 
  \[
  \text{Quarters used} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters}
  \]

Now, we sum the quarters used by all players:
\[
\text{Total quarters} = 12 + 24 + 24 + 8 = 68 \text{ quarters}

- \( S \): amount of salt
- \( O \): amount of oil
- \( F \): amount of fragrance
- \( Z \): amount of citrus zest
- \( G \): amount of sugar

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. \( Z = F \) (the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance)
2. \( S = G \) (the same amount of salt as sugar)
3. \( O = 2S \) (twice as much oil as salt)
4. \( S = 2Z \) (twice as much salt as zest)

We also know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces:

\[
S + O + F + Z + G = 10
\]

Now, we can express all variables in terms of \( Z \):

From \( S = 2Z \), we have:
- \( S = 2Z \)

From \( F = Z \), we have:
- \( F = Z \)

From \( G = S \), we have:
- \( G = 2Z \)

From \( O = 2S \), we have:
- \( O = 2(2Z) = 4Z \)

Now we can substitute these expressions into the total equation:

\[
S + O + F + Z + G = 10
\]

Substituting the expressions:

\[
2Z + 4Z + Z + Z + 2Z = 10
\]

Combining like terms:

\[
10Z = 10
\]

Now, solve for \( Z \):

\[
Z = 1
\]

Now we can find the amounts of the other ingredients:

- \( S = 2Z = 2(1) = 2 \)
- \( F = Z = 1 \)
- \( G = S = 2 \)
- \( O = 4Z = 4(1) = 4 \)

gsm8k,gsm8k-825,TrustRoute-NoParallel,2,"Let's define the number of cards each person has:

- Let \( P \) be the number of cards PJ has.
- Then Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards (since he has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has).
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards (since she has 12 more than Smendrick).

According to the problem, the total number of cards is 341. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341
\]

Now, let's simplify this equation:

\[
P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341
\]
\[
7P + 12 = 341
\]

Next, we will isolate \( P \) by subtracting 12 from both sides:

\[
7P = 341 - 12
\]
\[
7P = 329
\]

Now, divide both sides by 7:

\[
P = \frac{329}{7} = 47
\]

Now that we have \( P \), we can find the number of cards Smendrick has:

\[
\text{Smendrick's cards} = 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141
\]

Next, we can find the number of cards Becca has:

\[
\text{Becca's cards} = 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The weight of the book is 4 pounds.
   - The cost per pound is $0.35.
   - The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles.
   - The cost per mile is $0.08.

   **Shipping cost calculation:**
   \[
   \text{Shipping cost} = (\text{weight} \times \text{cost per pound}) + (\text{distance} \times \text{cost per mile})
   \]
   \[
   \text{Shipping cost} = (4 \, \text{pounds} \times 0.35 \, \text{dollars/pound}) + (20 \, \text{miles} \times 0.08 \, \text{dollars/mile})

2. **Calculate the refund from Amazon:**
   - The cost of the book is $32.
   - Amazon refunds 75% of the book's purchase price.

   **Refund calculation:**
   \[
   \text{Refund} = \text{cost of the book} \times 0.75

1. **Time spent filming TikTok videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Total time spent on videos per week = 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes.
   - For four weeks, the total time spent on videos = 72 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 288 minutes.

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - For four weeks, the total time spent writing songs = 2 hours/week * 4 weeks = 8 hours.
   - Converting hours to minutes: 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.

3. **Time spent doing makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes doing makeup each day for 6 days a week.
   - Total time spent on makeup per week = 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes.
   - For four weeks, the total time spent on makeup = 90 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 360 minutes.

Now, we can add all the time spent together:

- Time spent on videos: 288 minutes
- Time spent writing songs: 480 minutes
- Time spent doing makeup: 360 minutes

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - We know that 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway. 
   - The time taken is independent of the number of kangaroos since they are traveling together. Therefore, the time taken for any one kangaroo to cross the highway is also 18 hours.

2. **Calculate the distance:**
   - Let's denote the speed of a kangaroo as \( v \). The distance \( d \) that they travel can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     d = v \times t
     \]
   - For the kangaroos, the distance is:
     \[
     d = v \times 18
     \]

3. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of a turtle is:
     \[
     \text{Speed of turtle} = \frac{v}{2}
     \]

4. **Calculate the time taken by the turtles:**
   - We need to find out how long it will take for 4 turtles to travel the same distance \( d \). Using the formula for distance again:
     \[
     d = \text{Speed of turtle} \times \text{Time taken by turtles}
     \]
   - Substituting the speed of the turtle:
     \[
     d = \left(\frac{v}{2}\right) \times t
     \]
   - We already know \( d = v \times 18 \), so we can set the two equations for distance equal to each other:
     \[
     v \times 18 = \left(\frac{v}{2}\right) \times t
     \]

5. **Solve for \( t \):**
   - Cancel \( v \) from both sides (assuming \( v \neq 0 \)):

     18 = \frac{t}{2}

1. **Determine the number of dishes Jack has:**
   - Jack collected 60 dishes.

2. **Determine the number of socks Jack has:**
   - According to the problem, Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks.
   - Let \( S_J \) be the number of socks Jack has.
   - Since Jack has 60 dishes, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     60 = 2 \times S_J
     \]
   - Solving for \( S_J \):
     \[
     S_J = \frac{60}{2} = 30
     \]
   - So, Jack has 30 socks.

3. **Determine the number of socks Peter has:**
   - Peter has twice as many socks as Jack.
   - Let \( S_P \) be the number of socks Peter has:
     \[
     S_P = 2 \times S_J = 2 \times 30 = 60
     \]
   - So, Peter has 60 socks.

4. **Determine the number of dishes Peter has:**
   - Peter has half as many dishes as Jack.
   - Let \( D_P \) be the number of dishes Peter has:
     \[
     D_P = \frac{1}{2} \times D_J = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30
     \]
   - So, Peter has 30 dishes.

5. **Calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:**
   - Total socks = \( S_J + S_P = 30 + 60 = 90 \)
   - Total dishes = \( D_J + D_P = 60 + 30 = 90 \)

\[
A = P + I
\]

where:
- \( A \) is the total amount after time \( t \),
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial investment),
- \( I \) is the interest earned.

The interest \( I \) can be calculated using the formula:

\[
I = P \times r \times t
\]

where:
- \( r \) is the interest rate per year,
- \( t \) is the time in years.

In this case:
- \( P = 300 \) (the initial investment),
- \( r = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75 \) (the interest rate),
- \( t = 3 \) (the number of years).

Now, we can calculate the interest:

gsm8k,gsm8k-852,TrustRoute-NoParallel,2,"To calculate the total cost of buying 3 baskets of green food and red food, we need to determine how many of each type of basket is being purchased. Let's assume you buy \( x \) baskets of green food and \( y \) baskets of red food, with the condition that \( x + y = 3 \).

The cost of the baskets is as follows:
- Each basket of green food costs $25.
- Each basket of red food costs $18, but you get a discount of $2 for each basket of red food.

So, the effective cost of each basket of red food after the discount is:
\[
18 - 2 = 16 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, the total cost can be expressed as:
\[
\text{Total Cost} = (25 \times x) + (16 \times y)
\]

Since \( x + y = 3 \), we can express \( y \) as \( y = 3 - x \). Substituting this into the total cost equation gives:
\[
\text{Total Cost} = (25 \times x) + (16 \times (3 - x))
\]
\[
= 25x + 48 - 16x
\]
\[
= 9x + 48
\]

Now, we can calculate the total cost for different combinations of \( x \) and \( y \):

1. If \( x = 0 \) (0 baskets of green food, 3 baskets of red food):
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 9(0) + 48 = 48 \text{ dollars}

We are given the following information:

1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (the total number of books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the first equation.

From equation 3, we can express \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
\[
A = F - 12
\]

Now, substituting \( A \) into equation 2 to find \( S \):
\[
S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13
\]

Now we have expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
- \( S = F + 13 \)
- \( A = F - 12 \)

Now, we can substitute these into the total books equation:
\[
(F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85
\]

Combining like terms:

   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. Since the total cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10, the cost of one pack of bacon is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of one pack of bacon} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Therefore, the cost of one packet of chicken is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of one packet of chicken} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost for chicken is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of chicken} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Cost of strawberries**:
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, each priced at $4. Therefore, the total cost for strawberries is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of strawberries} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Cost of apples**:
   - Each pack of apples is priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries. Since a pack of strawberries costs $4, the cost of one pack of apples is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of one pack of apples} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost for apples is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of apples} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Total cost of all items**:
   - Now we can sum up the total costs:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of bacon} + \text{Cost of chicken} + \text{Cost of strawberries} + \text{Cost of apples}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 10 + 24 + 12 + 14 = 60 \text{ dollars}
     \]

6. **Calculating remaining budget**:
   - Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from her budget:
     \[
     \text{Remaining budget} = 65 - 60 = 5 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, Kelly has **$5** left in her budget.",0.0003789,8.34441089630127,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage1_only,

According to the problem:

1. Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.
2. Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.

Now, we need to calculate how much Tasha earned from mowing lawns:

- Joe paid Tasha $6 for mowing his lawn \( x \) times, so she earned:
  \[
  \text{Earnings from Joe} = 6x
  \]

- Let's assume Tasha charges the same amount for mowing Kamala's and Alba's lawns as she does for Joe's. Therefore:
  - Earnings from Kamala = \( 3x \times 6 = 18x \)
  - Earnings from Alba = \( 5x \times 6 = 30x \)

Now, we can calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:
\[
\text{Total earnings from mowing} = 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x
\]

According to the problem, Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[
54x + \text{Earnings from lemonade} = 80
\]

Let \( L \) be the earnings from lemonade sales. Thus, we have:
\[
54x + L = 80
\]

Now, we need to express \( L \) in terms of \( x \):
\[
L = 80 - 54x
\]

Next, we need to find \( x \). Since \( L \) must be non-negative, we have:
\[
80 - 54x \geq 0
\]
\[
80 \geq 54x
\]
\[
\frac{80}{54} \geq x
\]
\[
x \leq \frac{40}{27} \approx 1.481

Since \( x \) must be a whole number (as it represents the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn), the only possible value for \( x \) is 1.

Now substituting \( x = 1 \) back into the equation for \( L \):
\[
L = 80 - 54(1) = 80 - 54 = 26

1. **Monday**: Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
2. **Tuesday**: She removed twice as many as Monday, so:
   \[
   2 \times 39 = 78 \text{ Junebugs}
   \]
3. **Wednesday**: She removed the same amount as Tuesday, so:
   \[
   78 \text{ Junebugs}
   \]
4. **Thursday**: She removed 48 Junebugs.
5. **Friday**: She removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, we can sum these amounts to find the total number of Junebugs removed over the week:

\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

- \(39 + 78 = 117\)
- \(117 + 78 = 195\)

gsm8k,gsm8k-931,TrustRoute-NoParallel,2,"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( A \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + A + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   A = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's ages:
   \[
   P = A + J
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( P \) into the first equation.

First, substitute \( A \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now substitute \( P \) and \( A \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Combine like terms:

   - This is a flat rate of 1600 pesos.

2. **Cost of a 12-hour stay plus additional hours**:
   - The initial 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos.
   - Cameron arrives at 5 PM and wants to leave at 10 AM the next morning. This is a total of 17 hours (from 5 PM to 10 AM).
   - Since he is paying for the first 12 hours, he needs to pay for an additional 5 hours (17 hours total - 12 hours).
   - The cost for the additional 5 hours is calculated as follows:
     - Additional cost = 5 hours × 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the 12-hour stay plus additional hours is:
     - Total cost = 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos.

3. **Calculating the savings**:
   - If Cameron chooses the 12-hour stay with additional hours, he pays 1350 pesos.

1. The total points scored by all three is 45:
   \[
   B + A + D = 45
   \]

2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo:
   \[
   B = A + 20
   \]

3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar:
   \[
   B = D + 10
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( B \) from the second and third equations into the first equation.

From the second equation, we can express \( A \) in terms of \( B \):
\[
A = B - 20
\]

From the third equation, we can express \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
\[
D = B - 10
\]

Now, substituting \( A \) and \( D \) into the total points equation:
\[
B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45
\]

Simplifying this:
\[
B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45

\[
3B - 30 = 45

Now, add 30 to both sides:

1. **Total sleep duration**: Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours or 480 minutes.
2. **Waking up early**: On that day, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual. So instead of waking up at 6 a.m., she woke up at 5:55 a.m.
3. **Sleepwalking duration**: She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. This is a duration of 23 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the total time she was awake:

- She woke up at 5:55 a.m. and went to the bathroom, which means she was awake from 5:55 a.m. until she went back to sleep (which we will assume she did after going to the bathroom).
- Before that, she was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which means she was awake during that time as well.

Now, let's break it down:

1. **Total sleep time**: 480 minutes (from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.)
2. **Time awake**:
   - From 5:55 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. (5 minutes)
   - From 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. (23 minutes)

Adding these awake times together:
- Total awake time = 5 minutes + 23 minutes = 28 minutes

Now, we subtract the awake time from the total sleep time to find out how many minutes she actually slept:

- Total sleep = 480 minutes
- Total awake = 28 minutes

So, the total sleep time is:

2. **Calculate the number of measuring spoons:**
   Jonathan has \( \frac{2}{3} \) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, we calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = \frac{48}{3} = 16
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of utensils before gifting:**
   The total number of utensils is the sum of measuring cups and measuring spoons:

From the problem, we have the following equations:

1. \( A + S + D = 339 \) (the total number of Pokemon caught)
2. \( A = S + 5 \) (Alex has caught 5 more than Stan)
3. \( S = 4D - 13 \) (Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times what Adelwolfe has caught)

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( S \) from equations 2 and 3 into equation 1.

Substituting \( A \) from equation 2 into equation 1:

\[
(S + 5) + S + D = 339
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2S + D + 5 = 339
\]

Subtracting 5 from both sides gives:

\[
2S + D = 334 \quad \text{(Equation 4)}
\]

Now, we can substitute \( S \) from equation 3 into equation 4. From equation 3, we have:

\[
D = \frac{S + 13}{4}
\]

Substituting this into equation 4:

\[
2S + \frac{S + 13}{4} = 334
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 4:

\[
4(2S) + (S + 13) = 4(334)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
8S + S + 13 = 1336
\]

Combining like terms gives:

\[
9S + 13 = 1336
\]

Subtracting 13 from both sides:

\[
9S = 1323
\]

Dividing both sides by 9:

\[
S = 147
\]

Now that we have \( S \), we can find \( A \) and \( D \):

Using equation 2 to find \( A \):

\[
A = S + 5 = 147 + 5 = 152
\]

Using equation 3 to find \( D \):

\[
S = 4D - 13 \implies 147 = 4D - 13
\]

Adding 13 to both sides:

\[
160 = 4D
\]

Dividing by 4:

\[
D = 40
\]

Now we have:

- \( A = 152 \)
- \( S = 147 \)
- \( D = 40 \)

Finally, we can verify:

\[
A + S + D = 152 + 147 + 40 = 339
\]

Everything checks out. Therefore, the number of Pokemon Stan has caught is:

1. **First leg of the journey (south)**:
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 10 hours = 300 miles

2. **Second leg of the journey (north)**:
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 miles/hour × 2 hours = 36 miles

3. **Third leg of the journey (south)**:

   - Distance = Speed × Time = 22 miles/hour × 5 hours = 110 miles

Now, we can calculate the total distance traveled south and subtract the distance traveled north:

- Total distance traveled south = 300 miles (first leg) + 110 miles (third leg) = 410 miles
- Total distance traveled north = 36 miles (second leg)

Now, we find the net distance from the northern home to the southern home:

\[
\text{Net distance} = \text{Total distance south} - \text{Total distance north} = 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles}

- Let \( y \) be the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet for the first time, which is given as 30 years.

Since Halley's Comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we can determine the timeline as follows:

1. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
2. The next time the comet appears, Bill's dad will be \( 30 + 75 = 105 \) years old.
3. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw it the first time.

Now, we need to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet the second time.

According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. Therefore, the number of flights to Greece is:

\[
\frac{3}{4}x
\]

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. The remaining flights can be calculated as follows:

\[
x - \frac{3}{4}x = \frac{1}{4}x
\]

Since these remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France (and also to Germany) is:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{4}x \right) = \frac{1}{8}x
\]

Now, we also know that the second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
44 = \frac{1}{2}x
\]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides by 2:

\[
x = 88

   \text{Total selfies} = 3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 27 \text{ selfies}
   \]
   - Olivia has 2 albums of portraits, and similarly, the total number of portraits is:
   \[
   \text{Total portraits} = 2 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 18 \text{ portraits}
   \]

3. **Check the total**:
   To ensure the calculations are correct, we can add the number of selfies and portraits:
   \[
   \text{Total pictures} = \text{Total selfies} + \text{Total portraits} + \text{Remaining albums}
   \]
   The remaining albums (3 albums) must contain the rest of the pictures. Since each of those albums also contains 9 pictures, the total number of pictures in the remaining albums is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining albums} = 3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 27 \text{ pictures}
   \]

   Now, adding everything together:
   \[
   27 \text{ selfies} + 18 \text{ portraits} + 27 \text{ remaining pictures} = 72 \text{ pictures}

The price of each small stuffed animal is $4. Therefore, the price of each large stuffed animal, being three times that of a small one, is:

\[
3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}

1. **Substitute Teacher (50% chance)**:
   - If there is a substitute teacher, there is a 100% chance that Marcus will not have to turn in his homework.

2. **Normal Teacher (50% chance)**:
   - If the normal teacher is present, there are two possibilities:
     - **Extension Given (40% chance)**: If the teacher gives an extension, Marcus will not have to turn in his homework.
     - **No Extension (60% chance)**: If the teacher does not give an extension, there are further possibilities:
       - **Convince Teacher (20% chance)**: If Marcus convinces the teacher that his dog ate his homework, he will not have to turn in his homework.
       - **Cannot Convince Teacher (80% chance)**: If he cannot convince the teacher, he will have to turn in his homework.

Now, let's calculate the overall probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:

1. **Probability of having to turn in homework with the normal teacher**:
   - Probability of normal teacher: \(0.5\)
   - Probability of no extension: \(0.6\)
   - Probability of not convincing the teacher: \(0.8\)

   The probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework when the normal teacher is present is:

1. **Calculate Total Loans**: 
   Jim takes out $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years.
   \[
   \text{Total Loans} = 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000
   \]

2. **Calculate Lost Income**: 
   Before college, Jim had a job that paid $25,000 per year. For 4 years, the total lost income is:
   \[
   \text{Lost Income} = 25,000 \times 4 = 100,000

Now, we can express the total amount taken by all three people as follows:

\[
x + (x + 80) + 2 \times (x + 80) = 1920

     \[
     3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days}

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.

The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is given as 19. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Now, let's simplify this equation step by step:

1. Combine the terms on the left side:
   \[
   x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
   \]

2. To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 2:
   \[
   2(2x + 4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2 \cdot 19
   \]
   This results in:
   \[
   4x + 8 + x = 38

3. Combine like terms:
   \[
   5x + 8 = 38

4. Subtract 8 from both sides:

Now that we have \( x \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in each set:
- Second set: \( x = 6 \)
- First set: \( x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \)
- Third set: \( \frac{x}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \)

Finally, let's verify the total:

1. **Calculate the total number of sheets washed per week:**
   - Greg has 4 twin beds, and each twin bed has 1 set of sheets. Therefore, for the twin beds:
     \[
     4 \text{ twin beds} \times 1 \text{ set of sheets} = 4 \text{ twin sets of sheets}
     \]
   - He also has 1 king size bed, which has 1 set of sheets. Therefore, for the king bed:
     \[
     1 \text{ king bed} \times 1 \text{ set of sheets} = 1 \text{ king set of sheets}
     \]
   - Total sheets washed per week:
     \[
     4 \text{ twin sets} + 1 \text{ king set} = 5 \text{ sets of sheets}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of loads of laundry per week:**
   - Greg can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time. Therefore, for the 4 twin sets:
     \[
     \frac{4 \text{ twin sets}}{2 \text{ twin sets per load}} = 2 \text{ loads for twin sheets}

1. **Total slices of pizza**: There are 4 pizzas, and each pizza has 8 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices is:
   \[
   4 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices/pizza} = 32 \text{ slices}
   \]

2. **Slices eaten by Becky**: We know from the problem that Becky ate 10 slices.

3. **Relationship between Jake and Becky**: The problem states that Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake. Therefore, if we let \( J \) represent the number of slices Jake ate, we can write:
   \[
   B = J + 3
   \]
   Since we know \( B = 10 \) (the number of slices Becky ate), we can substitute:
   \[
   10 = J + 3
   \]
   Solving for \( J \):
   \[
   J = 10 - 3 = 7
   \]
   So, Jake ate 7 slices.

4. **Relationship between Silvia and Jake**: The problem states that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. Therefore, if we let \( S \) represent the number of slices Silvia ate, we can write:
   \[
   S = 2J
   \]
   Substituting \( J = 7 \):
   \[
   S = 2 \times 7 = 14
   \]
   So, Silvia ate 14 slices.

5. **Total slices eaten**: Now we can find the total number of slices eaten by adding the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:
   \[
   \text{Total slices eaten} = B + J + S = 10 + 7 + 14

The total time taken for the meal was 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
x + (x + 18) = 98
\]

Now, let's simplify the equation:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of emails that require a response each day.**

James receives 80 emails a day. If 20% of those emails don't require a response, then 80% do require a response.

First, calculate 20% of 80:

1. **Cost of Roses**:
   - The cost of one rose is $2.
   - Jenny bought 15 roses.
   - Total cost = 15 roses × $2/rose = $30.

2. **Money Jenny Brought**:
   - Jenny arrived with five $5 bills.
   - Total money = 5 bills × $5/bill = $25.

3. **Calculating the Difference**:
   - Jenny needs to pay $30 but only has $25.
   - This means she is short by $30 - $25 = $5.

4. **Change in Quarters**:
   - Since Jenny cannot pay the full amount, she cannot receive any change in quarters.
   - Therefore, she leaves with the same amount of money she had, which is $25.

5. **Converting to Quarters**:
   - Since she has $25 and they only have quarters for change, we need to convert her remaining money into quarters.

   - Leaves at: \(10 + 20 = 30\) minutes after Paul arrives.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives half an hour (30 minutes) after the first train leaves.
   - So, it arrives at: \(30 + 30 = 60\) minutes after Paul arrives.
   - The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is \(20 / 4 = 5\) minutes.
   - Leaves at: \(60 + 5 = 65\) minutes after Paul arrives.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives an hour (60 minutes) after the second train leaves.

1. **Total sodas**: Ellen has a case of 12 sodas.
2. **Shaken sodas**: Ellen shook 3 of the sodas.
3. **Unshaken sodas**: This means there are \( 12 - 3 = 9 \) unshaken sodas.
4. **Ellen's choice**: Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself. After this, the remaining sodas are:
   - Shaken sodas: 3
   - Unshaken sodas: \( 9 - 1 = 8 \)

5. **Ellen's brother's choice**: He takes:
   - 1 shaken soda
   - 2 unshaken sodas

   After Ellen's brother takes his sodas, the remaining sodas are:
   - Shaken sodas: \( 3 - 1 = 2 \)

We know that Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We also know that she spends 40 minutes walking on the beach.

First, we need to convert the time spent on the beach into hours:

\[
40 \text{ minutes} = \frac{40}{60} \text{ hours} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ hours}
\]

Next, we can calculate her speed on the beach using the formula:

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]

For the beach:

\[
2 \text{ miles} = v \times \frac{2}{3} \text{ hours}
\]

Solving for \( v \):

\[
v = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{\frac{2}{3} \text{ hours}} = 2 \times \frac{3}{2} = 3 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Now that we have Grandma's speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk:

\[
\text{Speed on sidewalk} = 2v = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Next, we calculate the time it takes her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk:

\[
\text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{6 \text{ miles per hour}} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ hours}
\]

Now we convert this time into minutes:

\[
\frac{1}{6} \text{ hours} = \frac{1}{6} \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 10 \text{ minutes}
\]

Finally, we can find the total time for her entire 3-mile walk by adding the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time on beach} + \text{Time on sidewalk} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time it takes Grandma to complete her entire 3-mile walk is:

Let \( T \) be the temperature of the second mug. Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle. The total volume of water in the bottle is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) ounces.

The total heat content of the water in the bottle can be calculated using the formula for the average temperature of mixed substances:

\[
\text{Average Temperature} = \frac{(m_1 \cdot T_1) + (m_2 \cdot T_2)}{m_1 + m_2}
\]

Where:
- \( m_1 = 4 \) ounces (from the 33-degree mug)
- \( T_1 = 33 \) degrees
- \( m_2 = 1 \) ounce (from the second mug)
- \( T_2 = T \) (unknown temperature of the second mug)

We want the average temperature to be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{(4 \cdot 33) + (1 \cdot T)}{4 + 1} \geq 40
\]

Now, we can simplify this equation:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiplying both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Now, subtract 132 from both sides:

   P(\text{Second Ticket}) = 3 \times P(\text{First Ticket}) = 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60
   \]

3. **Probability of Both Tickets Winning**: The probability that both tickets are winners is the product of the probabilities of each ticket winning, assuming the outcomes are independent:
   \[
   P(\text{Both Tickets}) = P(\text{First Ticket}) \times P(\text{Second Ticket}) = 0.20 \times 0.60
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{Both Tickets}) = 0.12
   \]

4. **Convert to Percentage**: To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
   \[
   P(\text{Both Tickets}) = 0.12 \times 100 = 12\%
   \]

Thus, the probability that both tickets are winners is **12%**.",0.000201,6.487524509429932,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage1_only,

According to the problem:

1. Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. Therefore, we can express Carlos's collection as:
   \[
   \text{Carlos's seashells} = 27 - 5 = 22

- Let \( r \) be the length of the red rope.
- Let \( b \) be the length of the blue rope.
- Let \( y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope:
   \[
   r = 4b
   \]

2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope:
   \[
   b = y - 7
   \]

3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters:
   \[
   r + b + y = 37
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( r \) and \( b \) into the combined length equation.

Substituting \( r = 4b \) into the combined length equation:
\[
4b + b + y = 37
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
5b + y = 37
\]

Now, substitute \( b = y - 7 \) into the equation:
\[
5(y - 7) + y = 37
\]

Expanding this gives:
\[
5y - 35 + y = 37

Adding 35 to both sides:
\[

According to the problem, half of the mural is yellow. Therefore, the amount of yellow paint used is:

\[
\text{Yellow paint} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \text{ pints} = 6 \text{ pints}

Now, we can express the total amount of paint used in the mural as the sum of the amounts of each color:

\[

This simplifies to:

\[

Next, we can solve for \( x \):

1. Subtract 6 from both sides:

\[

gsm8k,gsm8k-1181,TrustRoute-NoParallel,2,"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now:
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7)
   \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now:
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
   \]

Now we can solve these equations step by step.

### Step 1: Simplify the first equation
From the first equation:
\[
W = 5(C + 7) = 5C + 35
\]

### Step 2: Substitute \( W \) in the second equation
Now substitute \( W \) in the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35)
\]

### Step 3: Clear the fraction
Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5C + 35
\]
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

### Step 4: Rearrange the equation
Now, rearranging gives:
\[
75 - 35 = 5C - 3C
\]
\[
40 = 2C
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( C \)
Dividing both sides by 2:
\[
C = 20
\]

### Conclusion
Colin is currently \( \boxed{20} \) years old.

### Verification
To verify, we can find Wendy's age using \( C = 20 \):
1. Calculate \( W \):
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7) = 5(20 + 7) = 5 \times 27 = 135

1. **Building Rate**: Jay can build 20 snowballs in 1 hour (60 minutes). This means he builds:
   \[
   \frac{20 \text{ snowballs}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ snowball}}{3 \text{ minutes}}
   \]
   So, he builds 1 snowball every 3 minutes.

2. **Melting Rate**: Jay loses 2 snowballs every 15 minutes. This means he loses:
   \[
   \frac{2 \text{ snowballs}}{15 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{2}{15} \text{ snowballs per minute}
   \]

3. **Net Gain of Snowballs**: To find the net gain of snowballs per minute, we subtract the melting rate from the building rate:
   - Building rate: \( \frac{1}{3} \) snowballs per minute
   - Melting rate: \( \frac{2}{15} \) snowballs per minute

   To combine these rates, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 15 is 15. We convert \( \frac{1}{3} \) to have a denominator of 15:

\[
\text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{\text{Total cost of scotch}}{\text{Number of bottles}} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we find the cost per bottle of cognac. The cognac costs 50% more than the scotch:

\[
\text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} + 0.5 \times \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars}

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as he does scotch. Since he bought 10 bottles of scotch, he buys:

   SP = CP \times \frac{11}{8} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8}
   \]

   Now, calculate \( 72 \times \frac{11}{8} \):

   \[
   SP = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} = \frac{72 \times 11}{8} = \frac{792}{8} = 99
   \]

3. **Profit**: Profit is calculated as the difference between the selling price and the cost price:

   \[
   \text{Profit} = SP - CP = 99 - 72 = 27
   \]

Thus, Trinity's profit is **$27**.",0.00015434999999999998,5.191760301589966,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage1_only,

1. **Total Distance**: Phineas is 200 yards away from home.

2. **Distance on Land**: Since half of the distance is on land, the distance he will hop is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on Land} = \frac{200 \text{ yards}}{2} = 100 \text{ yards}
   \]

3. **Distance in Water**: The other half of the distance is in water, so:

1. **Red candies**: There are 54 red candies.

2. **Orange candies**: The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies.
   \[
   \text{Orange candies} = 2 \times \text{Red candies} = 2 \times 54 = 108
   \]

3. **Yellow candies**: The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies.
   \[
   \text{Yellow candies} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Red candies} = \frac{1}{2} \times 54 = 27

Now, we can calculate the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies:
\[
\text{Total of red, orange, and yellow candies} = \text{Red} + \text{Orange} + \text{Yellow} = 54 + 108 + 27 = 189

gsm8k,gsm8k-1294,TrustRoute-NoParallel,2,"To calculate the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to break down the costs of the T-shirts and the shoes separately.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of the T-shirts.**

The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, the total original price would be:

\[
\text{Total original price for T-shirts} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, with the buy one get one 50% off deal, Jake pays full price for the first T-shirt and 50% off for the second T-shirt. 

The price of the second T-shirt at 50% off is:

\[
\text{Discounted price for the second T-shirt} = 8 \times 0.5 = 4 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the total cost for the T-shirts is:

\[
\text{Total cost for T-shirts} = 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of the shoes.**

The original price of the shoes is $40. With a 40% discount, the amount of the discount is:

\[
\text{Discount on shoes} = 40 \times 0.4 = 16 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the price Jake pays for the shoes after the discount is:

\[
\text{Price after discount} = 40 - 16 = 24 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount spent.**

Now, we can add the total cost of the T-shirts and the shoes:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost for T-shirts} + \text{Price of shoes} = 12 + 24 = 36 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is:

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of making one jar

1. **Cost of Passion Fruit:**
   - Amount needed: 2 pounds
   - Cost per pound: $6
   - Total cost for passion fruit: \( 2 \, \text{pounds} \times 6 \, \text{dollars/pound} = 12 \, \text{dollars} \)

2. **Cost of Jackfruit:**
   - Amount needed: 1.5 pounds
   - Cost per pound: $8
   - Total cost for jackfruit: \( 1.5 \, \text{pounds} \times 8 \, \text{dollars/pound} = 12 \, \text{dollars} \)

3. **Cost of Special Honey:**
   - Amount needed: 2 pounds
   - Cost per pound: $10
   - Total cost for honey: \( 2 \, \text{pounds} \times 10 \, \text{dollars/pound} = 20 \, \text{dollars} \)

### Step 2: Total cost for one jar

Now, we sum the costs of all ingredients to find the total cost for one jar:

\[
\text{Total cost for one jar} = \text{Cost of Passion Fruit} + \text{Cost of Jackfruit} + \text{Cost of Honey}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost for one jar} = 12 + 12 + 20 = 44 \, \text{dollars}

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost for 10 jars

\[
\text{Total cost for 10 jars} = 10 \times \text{Total cost for one jar} = 10 \times 44 = 440 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total revenue from selling 10 jars

Tim sells each jar for $50, so the total revenue from selling 10 jars is:

\[
\text{Total revenue} = 10 \times 50 = 500 \, \text{dollars}

1. **Calculate the total cost of the watermelons**: The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80.

2. **Calculate the profit**: The vendor sold the watermelons at a profit of 25%. To find the selling price, we first need to determine the total selling price based on the profit.

   - Profit percentage = 25%
   - Total cost = $80
   - Profit = Total cost × Profit percentage = $80 × 0.25 = $20

3. **Calculate the total selling price**: 
   - Total selling price = Total cost + Profit = $80 + $20 = $100

1. **Dora's Age**: Dora will turn 12 in 3 years. Therefore, currently, she is:
   \[
   12 - 3 = 9 \text{ years old}
   \]

2. **James's Age**: James is currently twice as old as Dora. Since Dora is 9, James is:

1. **Calculate the number of oranges each person can peel in one hour.**
   - Ana takes 3 minutes to peel one orange.
   - Jane takes 4 minutes to peel one orange.

2. **Convert one hour into minutes.**
   - One hour = 60 minutes.

3. **Calculate the number of oranges peeled by Ana in 60 minutes:**
   \[
   \text{Number of oranges peeled by Ana} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges}

1. **Cost of the new radiator**: 
   - Original cost = $400
   - Discount = 80% of $400
   - Discount amount = 0.80 × $400 = $320
   - Cost after discount = $400 - $320 = $80

2. **Cost of the mechanic's labor**:
   - Hourly rate = $50
   - Time taken = 3 hours
   - Total labor cost = 3 hours × $50/hour = $150

3. **Total cost**:

gsm8k,gsm8k-1317,TrustRoute-NoParallel,2,"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( W \).

We have two equations based on the information provided:

1. The total number of animals:
   \[
   C + W = 20
   \]

2. The total number of legs:
   Chickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each, so:
   \[
   2C + 4W = 70
   \]

Now we can simplify the second equation. Dividing the entire equation by 2 gives us:
\[
C + 2W = 35
\]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( C + W = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2W = 35 \)

Next, we can solve for \( C \) and \( W \). We can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(C + 2W) - (C + W) = 35 - 20
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
W = 15
\]

Now that we have \( W \), we can substitute it back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[
C + 15 = 20
\]
\[
C = 20 - 15 = 5
\]

Thus, the number of chickens is \( \boxed{5} \).",0.00018764999999999995,4.1483378410339355,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage1_only,
