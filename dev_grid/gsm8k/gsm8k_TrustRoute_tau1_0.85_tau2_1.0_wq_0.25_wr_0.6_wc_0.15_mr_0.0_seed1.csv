1. **Calculate the total number of eggs laid per day**: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.

2. **Determine how many eggs she consumes**:
   - She eats 3 eggs for breakfast.
   - She uses 4 eggs for baking muffins.
   - Total eggs consumed = 3 + 4 = 7 eggs.

3. **Calculate the number of eggs remaining**:

1. **Calculate the total investment**: This includes the purchase price of the house and the cost of repairs.
   \[
   \text{Total Investment} = \text{Purchase Price} + \text{Repair Costs} = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000

2. **Calculate the increased value of the house**: The value of the house increased by 150%. To find the new value, we first calculate 150% of the original purchase price.
   \[
   \text{Increase in Value} = \text{Purchase Price} \times 1.5 = 80,000 \times 1.5 = 120,000
   \]
   Then, we add this increase to the original purchase price to find the new value of the house.
   \[

   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)

gsm8k,gsm8k-31,TrustRoute,1,"Let me help you figure out the average guess for the number of jelly beans in the jar. I'll break this down step by step for clarity.

### Step 1: Identify the guesses
- The first friend guesses: 80 jelly beans.
- The second friend guesses: 20 more than half of the first friend's guess.
  - Half of 80 is \( 80 \div 2 = 40 \).
  - Adding 20 to that: \( 40 + 20 = 60 \).
  - So, the second guess is 60.
- The third friend guesses: 25% more than the first friend's guess.
  - 25% of 80 is \( 0.25 \times 80 = 20 \).
  - Adding that to the original guess: \( 80 + 20 = 100 \).
  - So, the third guess is 100.

The three guesses are: 80, 60, and 100.

### Step 2: Calculate the average
- Add the guesses together: \( 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \).
- Divide by the number of guesses (which is 3): \( 240 \div 3 = 80 \).

Let G be the number of gold coins.
Let S be the number of silver coins.

From the problem statement, we can form two equations:

1.  **Total coins:** G + S = 110
2.  **Difference in coins:** G = S + 30 (There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins)

Now, we can use the substitution method to solve for G.

Substitute the second equation (G = S + 30) into the first equation:
(S + 30) + S = 110

Combine the S terms:
2S + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:
2S = 110 - 30
2S = 80

Divide by 2 to find S:
S = 80 / 2
S = 40

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins.

Now, use the value of S to find G using the second equation (G = S + 30):
G = 40 + 30
G = 70

Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

**Check:**
*   Gold coins + Silver coins = 70 + 40 = 110 (Correct)

### Step 1: Calculate the money from selling Lego sets
- John has 13 Lego sets and sells them for $15 each.
- If he sold all 13, he would earn:  
  \( 13 \times 15 = 195 \) dollars.
- However, the story states that after buying video games, he has $5 left. Let's check the expenses.

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of video games
- He buys 8 video games for $20 each:  
  \( 8 \times 20 = 160 \) dollars.
- If he has $5 left after this purchase, his total money after sales must have been:  
  \( 160 + 5 = 165 \) dollars.

### Step 3: Determine how many Lego sets were actually sold
- Let \( x \) be the number of Lego sets sold.
- Money earned from sales: \( 15x \) dollars.
- After buying games and having $5 left:  
  \( 15x - 160 = 5 \)
- Solve for \( x \):  
  \( 15x = 165 \)  
  \( x = 165 \div 15 = 11 \)

So, John sold 11 Lego sets, not all 13.

### Step 4: Calculate how many Lego sets he still has
- He started with 13 Lego sets.
- He sold 11.
- Lego sets left: \( 13 - 11 = 2 \).

### Final Answer
John still has **2 Lego sets**. This resolves the inconsistency in the story, as selling only 11 sets aligns with the money he earned and spent.",0.006796399999999999,16.068453073501587,0,0,cand-grok-3-mini,stage2_confidence,

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Calculate the weight removed from comic books:**
   - Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound.
   - He is removing 30 comic books.
   - Total weight from comic books = 30 × (1/4) = 30/4 = 7.5 pounds.

2. **Determine the remaining weight to remove:**
   - Total weight to remove = 15 pounds.
   - Weight already removed from comic books = 7.5 pounds.
   - Remaining weight = 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

3. **Calculate the number of toys needed to remove the remaining weight:**
   - Each toy weighs 1/2 pound.
   - Let X be the number of toys to remove.
   - The weight from toys should equal the remaining weight: X × (1/2) = 7.5.
   - Solve for X: X = 7.5 ÷ (1/2) = 7.5 × 2 = 15.

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

### Verification:
- Weight from comic books: 7.5 pounds.
- Weight from toys: 15 × (1/2) = 7.5 pounds.
- Total weight removed: 7.5 + 7.5 = 15 pounds.

### Step 1: Calculate revenue for Thursday
- Truck tires repaired: 6 at $60 each  
  Revenue from truck tires: 6 × $60 = $360  
- Car tires repaired: 4 at $40 each  
  Revenue from car tires: 4 × $40 = $160  
- Total revenue for Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

- Truck tires repaired: 0 at $60 each  
  Revenue from truck tires: 0 × $60 = $0  
- Car tires repaired: 12 at $40 each  
  Revenue from car tires: 12 × $40 = $480  
- Total revenue for Friday: $0 + $480 = $480

- Thursday revenue: $520  
- Friday revenue: $480  
- The day with higher revenue is Thursday ($520).  
- The difference in revenue: $520 - $480 = $40

We are given two pieces of information:
1.  The total number of games played is 22. So, W + L = 22.
2.  They won 8 more games than they lost. So, W = L + 8.

We want to find the number of games won (W).

We can substitute the second equation into the first one:
(L + 8) + L = 22

Now, solve for L:
2L + 8 = 22
2L = 22 - 8
2L = 14

Now that we know L (the number of games lost) is 7, we can find W using the second equation:

W = 7 + 8
W = 15

The total number of copies sold by both Marilyn and Harald is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
H + 10H = 88,000

Combining the terms on the left side gives:

gsm8k,gsm8k-106,TrustRoute,1,"To calculate the total inner volume of the 3 boxes, I'll first determine the inner dimensions of one box and then compute its volume. Finally, I'll multiply by the number of boxes.

### Step 1: Understand the outer dimensions and wall thickness
- Each box has outer dimensions: 5 inches (width) × 6 inches (length) × 4 inches (height).
- The walls are 1 inch thick, which means the inner dimensions are reduced by twice the wall thickness (1 inch on each side for each dimension).

### Step 2: Calculate the inner dimensions
- Inner length = Outer length - 2 × wall thickness = 6 inches - 2 × 1 inch = 6 - 2 = 4 inches.
- Inner width = Outer width - 2 × wall thickness = 5 inches - 2 × 1 inch = 5 - 2 = 3 inches.
- Inner height = Outer height - 2 × wall thickness = 4 inches - 2 × 1 inch = 4 - 2 = 2 inches.

So, the inner dimensions of one box are 4 inches × 3 inches × 2 inches.

### Step 3: Calculate the inner volume of one box
- Volume of a box = Length × Width × Height.
- Inner volume of one box = 4 inches × 3 inches × 2 inches = 24 cubic inches.

### Step 4: Calculate the total inner volume for all 3 boxes
- There are 3 boxes, so total inner volume = 3 × 24 cubic inches = 72 cubic inches.

### Final Answer
The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is **72 cubic inches**.",0.00120235,14.794967651367188,0,0,cand-grok-3-mini,stage2_confidence,

1.  **Monday:** 1 hour
2.  **Tuesday:** 1 hour
3.  **Thursday:** 1 hour (episode) + 30 minutes (show) = 1.5 hours
4.  **Friday:** 2 * 1 hour (episodes) = 2 hours

Now, let's sum the known TV watching time for these days:
1 hour (Mon) + 1 hour (Tue) + 1.5 hours (Thu) + 2 hours (Fri) = 5.5 hours

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. To find out how much time he watched on Wednesday, subtract the known time from the total time:
7 hours (Total) - 5.5 hours (Known days) = 1.5 hours

So, Frankie watched 1.5 hours of TV on Wednesday.
Since each episode on Wednesday was 30 minutes long, we need to convert 1.5 hours into 30-minute segments:
1.5 hours = 90 minutes
90 minutes / 30 minutes per episode = 3 episodes

However, he ended up baking 15 more cookies than he intended, so the total number of cookies he actually baked is:

\[
2x + 15
\]

After dropping 5 cookies, the number of cookies he has left is:

\[
(2x + 15) - 5 = 2x + 10
\]

We know from the problem that after dropping the cookies, he has a total of 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
2x + 10 = 110
\]

Now, we can solve for \( x \):

1. Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[
2x = 110 - 10

\[
2x = 100

### Step 1: Calculate Julia's rowing speed
- We know it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet.

- Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's (4 years ago)
- Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%
- Both salaries increased simultaneously (by the same percentage)

**Step 1: Find Lylah's salary 4 years ago**

If Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's:
- Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary × 1.30
- $40,000 = Lylah's salary × 1.30
- Lylah's salary = $40,000 ÷ 1.30
- Lylah's salary = $30,769.23 (approximately)

**Step 2: Find Adrien's salary four years later**

Adrien's new salary = $40,000 × 1.40 = $56,000

**Step 3: Find the percentage increase**

Since both salaries increased simultaneously (by the same percentage):
- Percentage increase = 40%

**Step 4: Find Lylah's salary four years later**

Lylah's new salary = $30,769.23 × 1.40 = $43,076.92 (approximately)

### Step 1: Identify the number of pieces in each box.
- The first box has 500 pieces.
- The second box has 3 times more pieces than the first box. This means it has 3 times the number of pieces in the first box, so:
  - 3 × 500 = 1,500 pieces.
- The third box has 1/4 the number of pieces. Based on the context, this likely refers to 1/4 of the first box (500 pieces), so:
  - (1/4) × 500 = 125 pieces.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of pieces.
- Add up the pieces from all three boxes:

   \text{Total length of croissants} = 120 \times 6 = 720 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total length of the baguettes:**
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert the length of a baguette to inches:
   \[
   \text{Length of each baguette in inches} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ inches}
   \]
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes.
   - Total length of baguettes = Number of baguettes × Length of each baguette
   \[
   \text{Total length of baguettes} = 60 \times 24 = 1440 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Sum the total lengths:**
   - Total length in inches = Total length of rolls + Total length of croissants + Total length of baguettes
   \[
   \text{Total length in inches} = 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 \text{ inches}
   \]

5. **Convert the total length from inches to feet:**
   - Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we divide the total length in inches by 12.
   \[
   \text{Total length in feet} = \frac{3360}{12} = 280 \text{ feet}

gsm8k,gsm8k-157,TrustRoute,1,"To determine how much farther the winner runs than the loser, we first need to calculate the distances that Blake and Kelly run.

**Blake's Distance:**
Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard football field. Each back-and-forth run consists of running 100 yards to one end and then 100 yards back, which totals 200 yards for each complete back-and-forth run.

So, for 15 back-and-forth runs:
\[
\text{Distance Blake runs} = 15 \times 200 \text{ yards} = 3000 \text{ yards}
\]

**Kelly's Distance:**
Kelly runs back and forth once on the football field (100 yards to one end and back), and then she runs to the 40-yard line and back. The distance to the 40-yard line is 40 yards, so the round trip to the 40-yard line is:
\[
\text{Distance to 40-yard line and back} = 40 \text{ yards} \times 2 = 80 \text{ yards}
\]

Now, we add the distance of her initial back-and-forth run (100 yards) to the distance she runs to the 40-yard line and back:
\[
\text{Total Distance Kelly runs} = 100 \text{ yards} + 80 \text{ yards} = 180 \text{ yards}
\]

**Calculating the Difference:**
Now, we find the difference in distance between Blake and Kelly:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Distance Blake runs} - \text{Distance Kelly runs} = 3000 \text{ yards} - 180 \text{ yards} = 2820 \text{ yards}

Thus, the winner (Blake) runs 2820 yards farther than the loser (Kelly).

**Team B (less well-rounded team):**
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 seconds - 3 seconds = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 seconds - 3 seconds = 54 seconds

gsm8k,gsm8k-186,TrustRoute,1,"To solve the problem, we need to break down the distribution of straw among the different rodents and set up an equation based on the information provided.

1. **Rats**: 
   - Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage.
   - There are 3 cages of rats, so the total number of rats is \( 3r \).
   - Each rat receives 6 pieces of straw, so the total straw given to rats is:
     \[
     \text{Straw for rats} = 3r \times 6 = 18r
     \]

2. **Hamsters**: 
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster receives 5 pieces of straw.
   - Let \( h \) be the number of hamsters in each cage.
   - The total number of hamsters is \( 10h \).
   - The total straw given to hamsters is:
     \[
     \text{Straw for hamsters} = 10h \times 5 = 50h
     \]

3. **Rabbits**: 
   - The total straw distributed among the rabbits is given as 20 pieces.

4. **Total straw distributed**: 
   - According to the problem, the total straw distributed among all rodents is 160 pieces. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
     \[
     18r + 50h + 20 = 160
     \]

5. **Simplifying the equation**:
   \[
   18r + 50h = 160 - 20
   \]
   \[
   18r + 50h = 140
   \]

Now, we need to find integer values for \( r \) and \( h \) that satisfy this equation.

6. **Finding values for \( r \) and \( h \)**:
   - Rearranging the equation gives:
     \[
     18r = 140 - 50h
     \]
   - This means \( 140 - 50h \) must be divisible by 18.

7. **Testing integer values for \( h \)**:
   - Let's test some values for \( h \):
     - If \( h = 0 \):
       \[
       18r = 140 \quad \Rightarrow \quad r = \frac{140}{18} \quad \text{(not an integer)}
       \]
     - If \( h = 1 \):
       \[
       18r = 140 - 50 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 18r = 90 \quad \Rightarrow \quad r = \frac{90}{18} = 5 \quad \text{(integer)}
       \]
     - If \( h = 2 \):
       \[
       18r = 140 - 100 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 18r = 40 \quad \Rightarrow \quad r = \frac{40}{18} \quad \text{(not an integer)}
       \]
     - If \( h = 3 \):
       \[
       18r = 140 - 150 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 18r = -10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad r \text{ cannot be negative.}

     \]

3. **Calculate the total earnings for the week:**
   - The total amount Mark makes in a week is the sum of his payments from both publishers:
     \[
     \text{Total earnings} = \text{Payment from Publisher A} + \text{Payment from Publisher B} = 2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents}
     \]

Thus, Mark makes a total of **7500 cents** in a week.",0.0025657500000000003,15.079708576202393,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,
