humaneval,HumanEval/84,FrugalGPT,1,"Below is the implementation of the `solve(N)` function based on the provided description. The function calculates the sum of the decimal digits of the input integer `N`, and then returns that sum as a binary string.

### Explanation:
- First, convert `N` to a string to access its individual digits.
- Sum the digits by iterating through the string and converting each character back to an integer.
- Convert the resulting sum to its binary representation as a string.
- The output is the binary string of the sum (without the '0b' prefix).

Here's the clean, executable Python code:

```python
def solve(N):
    # Convert N to string to process each digit
    str_N = str(N)
    
    # Calculate the sum of the digits
    sum_digits = 0
    for digit in str_N:
        sum_digits += int(digit)
    
    # Convert the sum to binary and remove the '0b' prefix
    binary_str = bin(sum_digits)[2:]  # [2:] removes '0b' from the binary representation
    
    return binary_str

# Example usage:
print(solve(1000))  # Output: '1' (sum of digits: 1+0+0+0 = 1, binary: 1)
print(solve(150))   # Output: '110' (sum of digits: 1+5+0 = 6, binary: 110)

humaneval,HumanEval/119,FrugalGPT,1,"To determine if two strings of parentheses can be concatenated in some order to form a balanced string, we need to check the balance of parentheses in both strings. A string is balanced if, at no point in the string, the number of closing parentheses exceeds the number of opening parentheses, and by the end of the string, the counts of opening and closing parentheses are equal.

Here's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:

1. Count the number of opening `(` and closing `)` parentheses in both strings.
2. Check the conditions for both concatenation orders:
   - First string followed by the second.
   - Second string followed by the first.
3. For each order, ensure that at no point does the number of closing parentheses exceed the number of opening parentheses when traversing the concatenated string.

Here is the implementation of the `match_parens` function:

```python
def match_parens(lst):
    def is_good(s):
        balance = 0
        for char in s:
            if char == '(':
                balance += 1
            else:  # char == ')'
                balance -= 1

# Example usage:
print(match_parens(['()(', ')']))  # Output: 'Yes'
print(match_parens([')', ')']))     # Output: 'No'
```

### Explanation:
- The `is_good` function checks if a given string of parentheses is balanced.
- We check both possible concatenations (`s1 + s2` and `s2 + s1`) to see if either results in a balanced string.
- The function returns 'Yes' if at least one concatenation is good, otherwise it returns 'No'.",0.0012717,23.009994983673096,0,0,gpt-4o-mini,,

1. Extract the values at the even indices from the input list.
2. Sort these values.
3. Create a new list where the values at the odd indices remain the same, and the values at the even indices are replaced with the sorted values.

### Explanation:
- We use a list comprehension to gather all the values at even indices.
- We sort this list of even-indexed values.
- We then create a result list that starts as a copy of the original list.
- Finally, we replace the values at the even indices of the result list with the sorted values.

1. The number of ones in their binary representation (in ascending order).
2. For numbers with the same count of ones, sort them by their decimal value (also in ascending order).

Here's how we can implement this in Python:

```python
def sort_array(arr):

    Sort an array of non-negative integers according to the number of ones in their binary representation

    >>> sort_array([1, 0, 2, 3, 4])
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    """"""
    # Sort by the number of ones in binary representation, then by the value itself
    return sorted(arr, key=lambda x: (bin(x).count('1'), x))

# Example usage
print(sort_array([1, 5, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(sort_array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

### Explanation:
- We use the `sorted()` function to sort the array.
- The `key` parameter is a lambda function that returns a tuple:
  - `bin(x).count('1')` counts the number of ones in the binary representation of `x`.
  - `x` is the decimal value itself.
- This ensures that the sorting is done first by the number of ones and then by the decimal value when the counts are the same.

### Explanation:
- **Edge Case Handling**: If the input list is empty, the function raises a `ValueError` to prevent division by zero.
- **Mean Calculation**: `sum(numbers) / len(numbers)` computes the arithmetic mean.
- **MAD Calculation**: A generator expression `abs(x - mean_value) for x in numbers` computes the absolute differences, and we sum them up and divide by the length of the list.
- **Efficiency**: This implementation uses built-in functions like `sum` and a generator for memory efficiency, especially for large lists.

    return hash_object.hexdigest()
```

### Explanation:
- **Import**: The `hashlib` module is imported at the top, as it's required for MD5 hashing.
- **Edge Case Handling**: The function first checks if the input `text` is an empty string using `if not text:`. If it is, it immediately returns `None`.
- **Hash Computation**: For non-empty strings, the function encodes the string to bytes using UTF-8 (a common encoding standard) and then computes the MD5 hash. The `hexdigest()` method returns the hash as a hexadecimal string.

1. Implement the `vowels_count` function correctly, as the function body is missing in your prompt.
2. Add more test cases to the docstring for better testing and clarity.

I'll start by implementing the function based on the description in the docstring. The function needs to count vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') in a case-insensitive manner and also count 'y' or 'Y' as a vowel only if it's at the end of the string.

Here's the fixed and complete code:

```python

        count += 1  # Add 1 for 'y' only if it's at the end
    
    return count
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Function Implementation**: I added the function body to make it executable. It iterates through the string to count standard vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' in any case) and then checks if the string ends with 'y' or 'Y' to add an extra count.
- **Added Test Cases**: I expanded the docstring by adding more examples (using the `>>>` doctest format). These cover a variety of scenarios, such as:
  - Strings with all vowels.
  - Strings ending with 'y' or 'Y'.
  - Strings with no vowels.
  - Empty strings.
  - Mixed case strings.
  - This helps in thorough testing and makes the function more robust.

You can now run this function in a Python environment and use tools like `doctest` to verify the examples. For instance:

humaneval,HumanEval/155,FrugalGPT,1,"Here's the complete implementation of the `even_odd_count` function in Python. I've added the function body based on the description in the docstring.

    """"""
    # Convert the number to a string to iterate through its digits
    str_num = str(num)
    even_count = 0  # Counter for even digits
    odd_count = 0   # Counter for odd digits
    
    for char in str_num:
        if char.isdigit():  # Skip non-digit characters (like the '-' sign)
            digit = int(char)

                odd_count += 1  # Otherwise, it's odd
    
    return (even_count, odd_count)  # Return the tuple of counts
```

### Explanation:
- **Conversion to string**: This allows us to easily access each digit, including handling negative numbers.
- **Loop through characters**: We only process digits using `char.isdigit()`, which skips the '-' sign.
- **Even/Odd check**: A digit is even if it's divisible by 2 (i.e., `digit % 2 == 0`).
- **Edge cases handled**:
  - Single digit (e.g., `even_odd_count(5)` returns `(0, 1)`).
  - Zero (e.g., `even_odd_count(0)` returns `(1, 0)`, since 0 is even).
  - Negative numbers (e.g., `even_odd_count(-0)` is treated as `0`, returning `(1, 0)`).

You can test this function directly in a Python environment. For example:
```python
print(even_odd_count(-12))  # Output: (1, 1)
print(even_odd_count(123))  # Output: (1, 2)
print(even_odd_count(0))    # Output: (1, 0)

2. Replace each vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' and their uppercase counterparts) with the letter that appears two places ahead in the English alphabet.
3. Return the modified message.

Here's the complete implementation of the `encode` function:

```python
def encode(message):
    vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'
    encoded_message = []

    for char in message:
        if char.isalpha():  # Check if the character is a letter

            if char in vowels:
                # Replace vowel with the letter 2 places ahead

        else:

# Example usage

print(encode('This is a message'))  # Output: 'tHKS KS C MGSSCGG'
```

### Explanation:
- We define a string `vowels` containing all vowels in both lowercase and uppercase.
- We iterate through each character in the input `message`.
- If the character is a letter, we check if it is a vowel:
  - If it is a vowel, we calculate the new character by finding its position in the alphabet, adding 2, and wrapping around using modulo 26.
  - If it is not a vowel, we simply swap its case.
- Non-letter characters are appended to the result without modification.

- If the list has an even number of elements, return the average of the two middle elements.

        mid2 = sorted_l[n // 2]     # Second middle element
        return (mid1 + mid2) / 2    # Average of the two middle elements
```

### Explanation:
- I added a check for an empty list to avoid errors, as it's good practice.
- The function sorts the list and computes the median as described.
- For the second example in your docstring (`[-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20]`), the sorted list is `[-10, 4, 6, 10, 20, 1000]`. The two middle elements are `6` and `10`, so the median is `(6 + 10) / 2 = 8.0`. I noted this discrepancy in the docstring.

humaneval,HumanEval/3,FrugalGPT,1,"Here's the implementation of the `below_zero` function based on the provided docstring. I'll add a brief explanation for clarity, as per my role in reasoning tasks.

### Explanation:
- We start with a balance of 0.
- We iterate through each operation in the list, updating the balance by adding the operation value.
- After each operation, we check if the balance is less than 0. If it is, we return `True` immediately.
- If we finish processing all operations without the balance going below 0, we return `False`.

This approach ensures we detect if the balance falls below zero at any point.

### Code:
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0  # Initialize balance to zero
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation  # Apply the operation

            return True  # Return True if it is
    return False  # Return False if no balance went below zero

### Explanation:
1. **Initial Check**: If the list is empty, we return `True` since an empty list can be considered monotonic.
2. **Flags**: We use two boolean flags, `increasing` and `decreasing`, initialized to `True`.
3. **Iteration**: We iterate through the list starting from the second element:
   - If the current element is greater than the previous one, we set `decreasing` to `False`.
   - If the current element is less than the previous one, we set `increasing` to `False`.

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing `min_sum` to infinity to ensure any sub-array sum will be smaller. `current_sum` is initialized to 0 to track the sum of the current sub-array.
2. **Iteration**: We iterate through each number in the input list:
   - We add the current number to `current_sum`.
   - We update `min_sum` if `current_sum` is smaller than the current `min_sum`.
   - If `current_sum` becomes positive, we reset it to 0 because a positive sum will not contribute to a minimum sub-array sum.

humaneval,HumanEval/130,FrugalGPT,1,"To implement the Tribonacci sequence as described in your prompt, we need to define the function `tri(n)` that computes the first `n + 1` numbers of the sequence based on the given rules. Let's break down the requirements and then write the code.

1. **Base Case**: 
   - `tri(1) = 3`
   
2. **Even Case**: 
   - If `n` is even, `tri(n) = 1 + n / 2`
   
3. **Odd Case**: 
   - If `n` is odd, `tri(n) = tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1)`

# Example usage
print(tri(3))  # Output: [1, 3, 2, 8]

### Notes:
- The function initializes a list `tribonacci` to store the computed values.
- It handles the base cases and iteratively computes the values for `n` from 2 to the input `n`.

humaneval,HumanEval/152,FrugalGPT,1,"Here's the completed implementation of the `compare` function in Python. I've added the function body based on the description in the docstring. The function takes two lists of equal length, `game` and `guess`, and returns a new list where each element is either 0 (if the corresponding elements are equal) or the absolute difference between them.

```python
def compare(game, guess):
    """"""
    I think we all remember that feeling when the result of some long-awaited
    event is finally known. The feelings and thoughts you have at that moment are
    definitely worth noting down and comparing.
    Your task is to determine if a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches.
    You are given two arrays of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index shows a match. 
    Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each guess was. If they have guessed correctly,
    the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.
    
    
    example:

    compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]) -> [0,0,0,0,3,3]
    compare([0,5,0,0,0,4],[4,1,1,0,0,-2]) -> [4,4,1,0,0,6]
    """"""
    # Create a new list by comparing each pair of elements
    return [0 if game[i] == guess[i] else abs(guess[i] - game[i]) for i in range(len(game))]
```

### Explanation:
- The function uses a list comprehension to iterate through the indices of the lists.
- For each index `i`, it checks if `game[i]` equals `guess[i]`. If they are equal, it adds 0 to the result list. Otherwise, it adds the absolute difference `abs(guess[i] - game[i])`.
- This approach ensures the code is clean, efficient, and easy to read.

You can test it with the provided examples:
- `compare([1,2,3,4,5,1], [1,2,3,4,2,-2])` should output `[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3]`.
- `compare([0,5,0,0,0,4], [4,1,1,0,0,-2])` should output `[4, 4, 1, 0, 0, 6]`.",0.0009558,18.036925077438354,0,0,grok-3-mini,,
humaneval,HumanEval/137,FrugalGPT,1,"To implement the `compare_one` function as described, we need to handle different types of inputs (integers, floats, and strings representing real numbers) and ensure that we can compare them correctly. We also need to account for the different decimal separators (i.e., '.' and ',') in string representations of numbers.

Here's the implementation of the `compare_one` function:

```python
def compare_one(a, b):
    def convert_to_float(value):
        if isinstance(value, str):
            # Replace ',' with '.' for conversion to float
            value = value.replace(',', '.')
        return float(value)

    # Convert both inputs to floats for comparison
    try:
        float_a = convert_to_float(a)
        float_b = convert_to_float(b)
    except ValueError:
        return None  # If conversion fails, return None

    # Compare the float values
    if float_a == float_b:
        return None
    elif float_a > float_b:
        return a
    else:
        return b

# Test cases
print(compare_one(1, 2.5))        # ➞ 2.5
print(compare_one(1, ""2,3""))      # ➞ ""2,3""
print(compare_one(""5,1"", ""6""))    # ➞ ""6""
print(compare_one(""1"", 1))         # ➞ None
```

### Explanation:
1. **Conversion Function**: The `convert_to_float` function handles the conversion of strings to floats, replacing commas with periods as necessary.
2. **Try-Except Block**: We use a try-except block to catch any conversion errors, returning `None` if the conversion fails.
3. **Comparison Logic**: After converting both inputs to floats, we compare them:
   - If they are equal, return `None`.
   - If `a` is greater, return `a`.
   - Otherwise, return `b`.

humaneval,HumanEval/41,FrugalGPT,1,"To determine the number of collisions between two sets of cars moving in opposite directions, we can analyze the situation as follows:

1. We have `n` cars moving from left to right and `n` cars moving from right to left.
2. Each car from the left will eventually collide with each car from the right since they are moving towards each other and there are no obstacles.
3. Therefore, each car from the left will collide with every car from the right.

Given that there are `n` cars in each direction, the total number of collisions can be calculated as the product of the number of cars in each direction:

\[
\text{Total Collisions} = n \times n = n^2

        if string[i:i + len_sub] == substring:
            count += 1
    
    return count
```

### Explanation:
- **Edge Case Handling**: If the substring is empty, the function returns 0 to avoid infinite or undefined behavior.
- **Looping Through Possible Starts**: The function iterates through the string from index 0 to `len(string) - len(substring) + 1`, checking if the substring matches at each starting position.
- **Overlapping Detection**: By checking every possible starting index, overlapping occurrences are naturally counted (e.g., in ""aaaa"" for ""aa"", it checks positions 0, 1, and 2).
- **Efficiency**: This approach has a time complexity of O(n * m), where n is the length of the string and m is the length of the substring, which is suitable for most practical uses.

You can test this function directly in a Python environment. For example:

humaneval,HumanEval/24,FrugalGPT,1,"Here's the completed implementation of the `largest_divisor` function in Python. I've added the function body to find the largest number that divides `n` evenly and is smaller than `n`. The code iterates from `n-1` down to 1 and returns the first divisor it finds, which will be the largest one.

    # Note: If n <= 1, the loop will not run, and the function will implicitly return None.
    # For robustness, you might want to add a check for n <= 1, but based on the problem, we assume n > 1.
```

### Explanation:
- **Loop**: Starts from `n-1` and goes down to 1, checking each number to see if it divides `n` evenly (i.e., `n % i == 0`).
- **Efficiency**: This approach is straightforward and works well for most inputs, though it could be optimized for very large numbers by checking only up to the square root of `n`.
- **Edge Cases**: 
  - For `n = 1`, the function will return `None` because there are no positive integers smaller than 1. If you need to handle this explicitly, you could add a check at the beginning (e.g., `if n <= 1: return 1` or raise an error).
  - For `n = 2`, it will return 1, which is correct.

        return round(area, 2)
    else:
        # Invalid triangle
        return -1

### Explanation:
- **Validation Check**: The function first verifies the triangle inequality theorem (sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side) and ensures all sides are positive (as negative or zero lengths don't make sense for a triangle).
- **Area Calculation**: If the sides are valid, it computes the semi-perimeter `s` and uses Heron's formula to find the area.
- **Rounding**: The area is rounded to 2 decimal places using `round(area, 2)`.
- **Edge Cases**: If the sides don't form a valid triangle (e.g., due to inequality violations or non-positive values), the function returns -1.

- It first handles edge cases: an empty array or a single-element array returns True.
- It finds the index of the smallest element.
- It simulates rotating the array so that the smallest element is at the beginning.
- It then checks if this rotated array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- If it is, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.",0.0014088,26.04698419570923,0,0,grok-3-mini,,

```

### Explanation:
- We use a `balance` counter to track the number of open brackets.
- For each ""<"", we increment the counter.
- For each "">"", we decrement the counter. If the counter goes negative, it means there's a closing bracket without a matching opening one, so we return `False`.
- At the end, the counter must be zero for the brackets to be correctly balanced.

humaneval,HumanEval/65,FrugalGPT,1,"Below is the complete implementation of the `circular_shift` function in Python. I've followed the specifications in your prompt:

- The function takes an integer `x` and an integer `shift`.
- It converts `x` to a string to manipulate its digits.
- If `shift` is greater than the number of digits in `x`, it returns the digits reversed.
- Otherwise, it performs a right circular shift by `shift` positions and returns the result as a string.

Here's the code:

```python
def circular_shift(x, shift):
    """"""
    Circular shift the digits of the integer x to the right by shift positions
    and return the result as a string.
    If shift > number of digits, return the digits reversed.

    '21'
    >>> circular_shift(12, 2)
    '12'
    """"""
    # Convert x to a string
    s = str(x)

    if shift > n:
        # If shift is greater than the number of digits, return the reversed string
        return s[::-1]
    else:
        # Perform right circular shift: move the last 'shift' characters to the front
        return s[-shift:] + s[:-shift]
```

### Explanation:
- **Line 1-2**: Convert the integer `x` to a string `s` for easy digit manipulation.
- **Line 3**: Check the length of `s` (number of digits).
- **Line 5-7**: If `shift > n`, reverse the string using slicing (`s[::-1]`).
- **Line 9-11**: Otherwise, perform the right circular shift by concatenating the last `shift` characters (`s[-shift:]`) with the rest of the string (`s[:-shift]`).

### Example Outputs:
- `circular_shift(12, 1)`: Returns `'21'`
- `circular_shift(12, 2)`: Returns `'12'`
- `circular_shift(123, 1)`: Returns `'312'`
- `circular_shift(123, 4)`: Since 4 > 3 (number of digits), returns `'321'`

- For each `i`, `string[:i]` extracts the prefix of the first `i` characters.
- This approach is efficient, concise, and handles edge cases:
  - If the string is empty (`""""`), the list will be empty (`[]`).
  - If the string has one character (e.g., `""a""`), it returns `[""a""]`.

        result.append(str(xor_result))  # Convert result back to string
    
    return ''.join(result)  # Join the list into a single string

### Explanation:
- **Input Validation**: I added a check to ensure the strings are of the same length, as XOR requires corresponding bits. If they're not, it raises a `ValueError`.
- **XOR Operation**: For each index, I convert the characters to integers (0 or 1), perform the bitwise XOR using the `^` operator, and convert the result back to a string.
- **Output**: The function returns a new string representing the XOR result.
- **Example Usage**:
  - `string_xor('010', '110')` will return `'100'`, as shown in the docstring.

2. Iterate through the input array and use the helper function to check if the sum of digits for each number is greater than zero.
3. Count and return the total number of integers that meet this criterion.

Here’s the implementation:

print(count_nums([-1, 11, -11]))  # Expected output: 1
print(count_nums([1, 1, 2]))  # Expected output: 3

### Explanation:
- The `sum_of_digits` function calculates the sum of the digits of a number. If the number is negative, it adjusts the total by subtracting twice the first digit to account for its negative contribution.
- The main function `count_nums` iterates through each number in the input array, checks if the sum of its digits is greater than zero, and counts how many such numbers exist.

humaneval,HumanEval/160,FrugalGPT,1,"Below is the implementation of the `do_algebra` function based on the description you provided. The function takes two lists as input: `operator` (a list of strings representing the operators) and `operand` (a list of non-negative integers). It constructs a string representation of the algebraic expression and evaluates it using Python's `eval()` function, which respects the standard operator precedence (e.g., multiplication and exponentiation before addition and subtraction).

### Key Points in the Implementation:
- The function first checks if the lengths of the input lists are valid (i.e., the number of operators is exactly one less than the number of operands).
- It builds the expression string by starting with the first operand and appending each operator and subsequent operand.
- The expression is then evaluated safely, assuming the inputs conform to the problem constraints (e.g., operators are from the specified set, and operands are non-negative integers).
- To minimize risks with `eval()`, the function only constructs strings from the provided inputs, which are limited to numbers and the allowed operators.

Here's the complete, executable code:

```python
def do_algebra(operator, operand):
    """"""
    Given two lists: operator (a list of strings with basic algebra operations)
    and operand (a list of non-negative integers), build and evaluate the algebraic

    Subtraction (-) 
    Multiplication (*) 
    Floor division (//) 
    Exponentiation (**)

    Example:
    operator = ['+', '*', '-']
    operand = [2, 3, 4, 5]
    result = 2 + 3 * 4 - 5 = 9

    Note:
        The length of operator list is equal to the length of operand list minus one.
        Operand is a list of non-negative integers.
        Operator list has at least one operator, and operand list has at least two operands.
    """"""
    
    if len(operator) != len(operand) - 1:
        raise ValueError(""The length of the operator list must be exactly one less than the operand list."")
    
    # Build the expression string
    expression = str(operand[0])  # Start with the first operand
    for op, num in zip(operator, operand[1:]):  # Iterate through operators and remaining operands
        expression += f"" {op} {num}""  # Append operator and operand with spaces for proper parsing
    
    # Evaluate the expression
    result = eval(expression)  # eval() will handle operator precedence correctly
    return result
```

### Example Usage:
You can test the function in a Python environment like this:

```python
# Example 1
operator1 = ['+', '*', '-']
operand1 = [2, 3, 4, 5]
print(do_algebra(operator1, operand1))  # Output: 9

# Example 2
operator2 = ['**', '//']
operand2 = [2, 3, 2]  # Expression: 2 ** 3 // 2 = 8 // 2 = 4
print(do_algebra(operator2, operand2))  # Output: 4

# Example 3
operator3 = ['+']
operand3 = [1, 1]  # Expression: 1 + 1 = 2
print(do_algebra(operator3, operand3))  # Output: 2
```

### Important Notes:
- **Operator Precedence**: The evaluation follows Python's operator precedence rules (e.g., `**` has higher precedence than `*` or `//`, which have higher precedence than `+` or `-`). This matches the example you provided.
- **Safety Considerations**: While `eval()` is used here for simplicity, in a production environment, you might want to use a safer alternative like `ast.literal_eval()` combined with a custom parser if the inputs could be untrusted. However, based on the problem constraints, this implementation should work fine.
- **Error Handling**: The function raises a `ValueError` if the input lengths are invalid, as per the problem's assumptions.

humaneval,HumanEval/96,FrugalGPT,1,"To implement the `count_up_to` function that returns an array of the first prime numbers less than a given non-negative integer `n`, we can follow these steps:

1. Create a helper function to check if a number is prime.
2. Iterate through numbers starting from 2 up to `n-1`.
3. Collect prime numbers in a list and return that list.

Here’s the complete implementation:

```python
def is_prime(num):
    """"""Check if a number is prime.""""""
    if num <= 1:

### Explanation:
- The `is_prime` function checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number.
- The `count_up_to` function initializes an empty list `primes`, iterates through all integers from 2 to `n-1`, and appends each prime number found to the list.
- Finally, it returns the list of prime numbers.",0.0014794,26.6805100440979,0,0,gpt-4o-mini,,
humaneval,HumanEval/22,FrugalGPT,1,"Here's the completed implementation of the `filter_integers` function based on the provided signature and docstring. I've added a clear and efficient function body using a list comprehension to filter out only the integer values.

    [1, 2, 3]
    """"""
    return [x for x in values if isinstance(x, int) and not isinstance(x, bool)]
```

### Explanation:
- **List Comprehension**: The line `return [x for x in values if isinstance(x, int) and not isinstance(x, bool)]` iterates through each element in the input list `values`.
- **Type Check**: `isinstance(x, int)` checks if the element is an integer. We add `and not isinstance(x, bool)` to exclude boolean values (e.g., `True` or `False`), as they are subclasses of `int` but not typically considered ""integers"" in this context.
- **Output**: This returns a new list containing only the integers from the input list.

            return False  # If not, the string is not happy
    
    return True  # All triplets are distinct, so the string is happy
```

### Explanation:
- **Length Check**: First, we check if the string's length is less than 3. If so, it returns `False`.
- **Triplet Check**: We loop through the string and examine every substring of 3 consecutive characters (from index `i` to `i+2`).
- **Distinct Characters**: For each triplet, we convert it to a set and check if the set's length is 3 (meaning all characters are unique). If any triplet has duplicates, the function returns `False`.
- **Return True**: If all triplets pass the check, the function returns `True`.

humaneval,HumanEval/7,FrugalGPT,1,"Here's the completed implementation of the `filter_by_substring` function based on the provided signature and docstring. I've used a list comprehension for a clean and efficient solution.

```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:
    """""" Filter an input list of strings only for ones that contain given substring
    >>> filter_by_substring([], 'a')

    ['abc', 'bacd', 'array']
    """"""
    return [s for s in strings if substring in s]  # Use list comprehension to filter strings containing the substring
```

### Explanation:
- **Functionality**: The function iterates through the input list `strings` and includes only those strings that contain the `substring` (using the `in` operator for substring checking).
- **Edge Cases**:
  - If `strings` is an empty list, it returns an empty list, as shown in the docstring.
  - The check is case-sensitive (e.g., 'a' will not match 'A').
  - If `substring` is an empty string, it will return the entire list, as an empty string is considered a substring of every string (this follows Python's standard behavior).
- **Why this implementation?**: It's concise, readable, and efficient with a time complexity of O(n * m), where n is the length of the list and m is the average length of the strings (due to the substring check).

You can test this function directly in a Python environment. For example:
```python
print(filter_by_substring(['abc', 'bacd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a'))  # Output: ['abc', 'bacd', 'array']
print(filter_by_substring([], 'a'))  # Output: []

humaneval,HumanEval/106,FrugalGPT,1,"Here's the implementation of the function `f(n)` as described in the query. I've written clean, executable Python code that follows the specifications. The function computes the required list where:

- For each index `i` (from 1 to n):
  - If `i` is even, the value is the factorial of `i` (i.e., 1 * 2 * ... * i).
  - If `i` is odd, the value is the sum of numbers from 1 to `i` (i.e., 1 + 2 + ... + i).

The code includes helper functions for clarity and reusability.

```python
def factorial(k):
    """"""Compute the factorial of k (1 * 2 * ... * k).""""""
    if k == 0 or k == 1:

# Example usage:
print(f(5))  # Output: [1, 2, 6, 24, 15]
```

### Explanation:
- **factorial(k)**: This function calculates the factorial of `k` iteratively.
- **sum_up_to(k)**: This uses the formula for the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which is efficient and accurate.
- **f(n)**: This function generates the list using a list comprehension. It iterates over `i` from 1 to `n`, applying the appropriate calculation based on whether `i` is even or odd.
- The returned list is 0-based in Python, but the values correspond to `i` starting from 1, as required.

You can run this code directly in a Python environment to verify it. For example:
- `f(1)` returns `[1]`
- `f(5)` returns `[1, 2, 6, 24, 15]` as in the example.",0.0009093,17.808067321777344,0,0,grok-3-mini,,
humaneval,HumanEval/76,FrugalGPT,1,"To determine if a number `x` is a simple power of `n`, we need to check if there exists an integer `k` such that \( n^k = x \). The function will return `True` if such an integer exists and `False` otherwise.

Here's how we can implement this:

1. Handle special cases:
   - If `n` is 1, then `x` must also be 1 to return `True`, otherwise return `False`.
   - If `x` is 1, then it is a power of any `n` (except when `n` is 0).
   
2. For other values of `n`, we can use a loop to compute powers of `n` until we either find `x` or exceed it.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def is_simple_power(x, n):
    """"""Returns True if x is a simple power of n, otherwise False.""""""
    if n == 1:
        return x == 1
    if x < 1 or n < 1:
        return False
    
    power = 1
    while power < x:
        power *= n

print(is_simple_power(3, 2))  # False
print(is_simple_power(3, 1))  # False
print(is_simple_power(5, 3))  # False

### Explanation:
1. **Input Parameters**: The function takes two strings, `s` (the original string) and `c` (the characters to be deleted).
2. **Character Deletion**: A set is created from string `c` for efficient membership testing. The result string is constructed by including only those characters from `s` that are not in the delete set.
3. **Palindrome Check**: The function checks if the resulting string reads the same forwards and backwards by comparing it to its reverse.
4. **Return Value**: The function returns a tuple containing the modified string and a boolean indicating whether it is a palindrome.",0.00095105,18.46394991874695,0,0,gpt-4o-mini,,

### Explanation:
- **Even positions**: These are indices like 0, 2, 4, etc. (zero-based indexing).
- **Odd elements**: An integer is odd if it's not divisible by 2 (i.e., `number % 2 != 0`). This works for positive, negative, and zero values.
- The function iterates through the list once, checks the conditions, and computes the sum efficiently.
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the list, as we loop through each element once.

Here's how we can achieve this step by step:

1. Define a helper function to calculate the sum of the digits of a number. This function should handle negative numbers by taking the absolute value.
2. Use the `sorted()` function with a custom key that uses the digit sum for sorting. We will also include the original index to maintain the order for items with the same digit sum.
3. Return the sorted list.

Here's the complete implementation:

    sorted_nums = sorted(indexed_nums, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
    
    # Extract the sorted values
    return [num for _, _, num in sorted_nums]

### Explanation:
- The `digit_sum` function computes the sum of the digits of a number, ignoring the sign.
- We create a list of tuples where each tuple contains the digit sum, the original index, and the number itself.
- We sort this list of tuples first by the digit sum and then by the original index.

Based on the docstring and examples, I'll complete the implementation for you. The function needs to find a root of the polynomial defined by the coefficients in `xs`, using a numerical method since analytical solutions aren't feasible for general polynomials.

I'll use the bisection method to find the root, as it's simple, reliable, and works well for continuous functions like polynomials. Since the problem guarantees a real root (due to the even length of `xs` implying an odd-degree polynomial), I'll start with a large interval (e.g., [-1e6, 1e6]) to ensure we capture the root.

### Explanation:
- **Bisection Method**: This is a root-finding algorithm that repeatedly bisects an interval and selects the subinterval where the function changes sign. It's guaranteed to converge for continuous functions like polynomials.
- **Initial Interval**: I chose [-1e6, 1e6] as the starting interval because odd-degree polynomials will have at least one real root, and this range is wide enough for typical cases like your examples.
- **Tolerance**: The method stops when the interval is smaller than 1e-6, ensuring a precise result.
- **Edge Cases**: I added a check for the length of `xs` to ensure it's even, as per the docstring. If no sign change is found (which shouldn't happen based on the problem's guarantees), it raises an error.
- **Docstring Fix**: I noted a typo in the original `poly` docstring (it said `xs[1] * x^2` twice), but I didn't change the function itself.

            changes += 1  # Increment the counter if they don't match
    
    return changes  # Return the total number of changes needed
```

### Explanation:
- The function iterates through the first half of the array (up to `n // 2` elements).
- For each index `i`, it checks if `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[n - 1 - i]` (the corresponding element from the end).
- If they are not equal, it increments the `changes` counter by 1, as at least one element in the pair needs to be changed.
- The loop only goes up to the middle, so the middle element (if the array length is odd) is automatically ignored, as it doesn't affect the palindrome property.

### Examples:
- `smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 9, 6])` returns `4`.
- `smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2])` returns `1`.

humaneval,HumanEval/17,FrugalGPT,1,"Here's the implementation of the `parse_music` function based on the provided description and legend. I'll first explain the approach briefly, then provide the complete, executable code.

### Explanation:
- The input string is a space-separated sequence of notes.
- We'll split the string into individual notes using `str.split()`, which handles whitespace appropriately.
- For each note:
  - If it's `'o'`, it represents a whole note (4 beats).
  - If it's `'o|'`, it represents a half note (2 beats).
  - If it's `'.|'`, it represents a quarter note (1 beat).
- We'll iterate through the list of notes and build a new list of corresponding beat values.
- Finally, return the list of beats.

This implementation assumes the input string only contains valid notes as per the legend. If invalid notes are present, they will be ignored (resulting in no beats added for them), but based on the problem, we can expect well-formed input.

### Code:
```python
from typing import List

def parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:
    # Split the input string into individual notes
    notes = music_string.split()

- The function first parses the input strings to extract the numerators and denominators.
- It then calculates the numerator of the product (`a * c`) and the denominator of the product (`b * d`).
- Finally, it checks if the numerator is exactly divisible by the denominator (i.e., the remainder is 0), which means the product is a whole number.
- The function returns `True` if it is a whole number and `False` otherwise.

### Examples:
- `simplify(""1/5"", ""5/1"")`: Product is (1/5) * (5/1) = 1, which is a whole number. Output: `True`.
- `simplify(""1/6"", ""2/1"")`: Product is (1/6) * (2/1) = 1/3, not a whole number. Output: `False`.
- `simplify(""7/10"", ""10/2"")`: Product is (7/10) * (10/2) = 3.5, not a whole number. Output: `False`.

humaneval,HumanEval/69,FrugalGPT,1,"To solve the problem, we need to count the frequency of each integer in the list and then check which integers meet the criteria of having a frequency greater than or equal to their own value. Finally, we will return the greatest integer that satisfies this condition or -1 if none do.

Here's the implementation of the `search` function:

```python
def search(lst):
    from collections import Counter
    
    # Count the frequency of each integer in the list
    frequency = Counter(lst)
    
    # Initialize the result variable
    result = -1
    
    # Iterate through the frequency dictionary
    for num, freq in frequency.items():
        # Check if the frequency is greater than or equal to the number itself
        if freq >= num:
            # Update the result if this number is greater than the current result
            result = max(result, num)
    
    return result

# Example test cases
print(search([4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]))  # Output: 2
print(search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]))  # Output: 3
print(search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]))  # Output: -1
```

### Explanation:
1. We use the `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each integer in the list.
2. We initialize `result` to -1, which will hold our answer.
3. We loop through each unique number and its frequency:
   - If the frequency of the number is greater than or equal to the number itself, we check if it's greater than the current `result`.
   - If it is, we update `result`.
4. Finally, we return `result`, which will be -1 if no valid number was found.",0.0011765,20.887997150421143,0,0,gpt-4o-mini,,

### Explanation:
- **Base Cases:** The function directly returns the values for `n = 0`, `n = 1`, and `n = 2` as per the definition.
- **Iterative Computation:** For `n >= 3`, we use a list to store the sequence values and compute each subsequent value based on the previous three values. This ensures the function runs in O(1 + n) time complexity (linear in n) and O(n) space.
- **Edge Cases:** The function assumes `n >= 0` based on the problem description. If negative inputs need handling, additional checks can be added.

### Explanation:
- **List Comprehension**: The line `return [s for s in strings if s.startswith(prefix)]` iterates through each string in the `strings` list and includes it in the new list only if it starts with the `prefix`.
- **Edge Cases Handled**:
  - If `strings` is an empty list, the function returns an empty list.

### Explanation:
- We use the inclusion-exclusion principle to avoid double-counting numbers that both start and end with 1.
- For n = 1, there's only one such number: 1.
- For n ≥ 2:
  - Numbers starting with 1: There are 10^(n-1) such numbers (e.g., for n=2, 10-19).
  - Numbers ending with 1: There are 9 * 10^(n-2) such numbers (first digit 1-9, middle digits 0-9, last digit 1).
  - Numbers starting and ending with 1: There are 10^(n-2) such numbers.
- The total count is then: (numbers starting with 1) + (numbers ending with 1) - (numbers starting and ending with 1).

Here's the clean and executable code:

```python
def starts_one_ends(n):
    """"""
    Given a positive integer n, return the count of the numbers of n-digit

        B = 9 * 10 ** (n - 2)

### Explanation:
- **uppercase_vowels**: A set for quick lookup of uppercase vowels.
- **Loop with enumerate**: This gives both the index and the character, allowing us to filter by even indices.
- **Conditions**:
  - `index % 2 == 0`: Ensures we're only considering even indices (0, 2, 4, etc.).
  - `char in uppercase_vowels`: Checks if the character is one of the uppercase vowels.

humaneval,HumanEval/154,FrugalGPT,1,"To solve the problem of checking if the second word or any of its rotations is a substring of the first word, we can follow these steps:

1. Generate all rotations of the second word.
2. Check if any of these rotations exist as a substring in the first word.
3. Return `True` if any rotation is found, otherwise return `False`.

Here's the implementation of the `cycpattern_check` function:

```python
def cycpattern_check(a, b):
    """"""Check if the second word or any of its rotations is a substring in the first word.""""""
    # Generate all rotations of the second word

### Explanation:
- We create a list of all possible rotations of the string `b` using a list comprehension.
- We then iterate through each rotation and check if it is a substring of `a`.
- If we find any rotation that is a substring, we return `True`. If none are found after checking all rotations, we return `False`.",0.0010701999999999,18.90370535850525,0,0,gpt-4o-mini,,

I'll complete the function based on the description in the docstring: ""Given a non-empty list of integers lst, add the even elements that are at odd indices.""

Here's the full, executable Python code for the function:

```python
def add(lst):
    """"""
    Given a non-empty list of integers lst, add the even elements that are at odd indices.
    
    Examples:

            total += value  # Add the even value at the odd index
    return total  # Return the final sum
```

### Explanation:
- **Looping through the list**: We use `enumerate(lst)` to get both the index and the value for each element.
- **Conditions**:
  - `index % 2 != 0`: This checks if the index is odd (e.g., 1, 3, 5, etc.).
  - `value % 2 == 0`: This checks if the value is even.
- **Edge cases handled**:
  - If the list has no even elements at odd indices, the function returns 0.
  - The list is assumed to be non-empty as per the docstring.

You can test this function in a Python environment. For example:
```python
print(add([4, 2, 6, 7]))  # Output: 2
print(add([1, 3, 5]))     # Output: 0 (no even elements at odd indices)
print(add([1, 2]))        # Output: 2 (element at index 1 is even)

    """"""
    return [x for x in l if x > 0]  # Use a list comprehension to filter positive numbers
```

### Explanation:
- **Function Body**: I used a list comprehension to iterate through the input list `l` and include only the elements `x` where `x > 0`. This is a concise and efficient way to filter the list.
- **Edge Cases Handled**:
  - Zero is not considered positive, so it's excluded (as per the examples).
  - Negative numbers are excluded.
  - If the input list is empty, the function will return an empty list.
- **Assumptions**: The input is a list of numbers, as shown in the examples. If the list might contain non-numeric values, additional error handling could be added, but it's not indicated in the prompt.

You can test this function in a Python environment. For example:

```python
# Test cases
print(get_positive([-1, 2, -4, 5, 6]))  # Output: [2, 5, 6]
print(get_positive([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]))  # Output: [5, 3, 2, 3, 9, 123, 1]

- We then process the string: For each character, if it's a letter, we swap its case using the `swapcase()` method; otherwise, we leave it unchanged.
- If the string contains no letters, we reverse the processed string.
- Finally, we return the resulting string.

This code is clean, efficient, and handles all the examples you mentioned:
- `solve(""1234"")` → No letters, so reverse to ""4321"".
- `solve(""ab"")` → Swap cases to ""AB"".
- `solve(""#a@C"")` → Swap 'a' to 'A' and 'C' to 'c', resulting in ""#A@c"".

### Code:
```python
def solve(s):

    # Process the string: Swap case for letters, leave others unchanged

humaneval,HumanEval/44,FrugalGPT,1,"To implement the `change_base` function that converts a given integer `x` into a specified base (less than 10), we can follow these steps:

1. Handle the case where `x` is zero, as it should return '0' in any base.

3. The remainders represent the digits in the new base, but they need to be collected in reverse order.
4. Finally, join the collected digits into a string and return it.

    # Convert the list to a set to remove duplicates
    unique_elements = set(l)
    # Sort the unique elements and return as a list

### Explanation:
- **Step 1:** We use `set(l)` to create a set from the input list, which automatically removes duplicates.
- **Step 2:** We then use `sorted()` to sort the elements of the set in ascending order. The `sorted()` function returns a new list.
- **Output:** The function returns a sorted list of unique elements.

```

### Explanation:
- **Formula Used**: The function uses the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers: \( n \times (n + 1) / 2 \). I used `//` for integer division to avoid any floating-point issues and ensure the output is an integer.
- **Edge Case Handling**: I added a simple check for `n < 1` to raise an error, as the docstring examples only cover positive integers. If you don't want this, it can be removed.
- **Testing**: You can verify the function with the provided examples in the docstring. For instance:
  - `sum_to_n(30)` returns 465.

### Explanation:

humaneval,HumanEval/147,FrugalGPT,1,"The problem asks us to count triples `(a[i], a[j], a[k])` from an array `a` such that `1 <= i < j < k <= n` and their sum `a[i] + a[j] + a[k]` is a multiple of 3. The array elements are defined as `a[x] = x*x - x + 1`.

Let's analyze the remainder of `a[x]` when divided by 3, which is `a[x] % 3`. The sum `a[i] + a[j] + a[k]` is a multiple of 3 if and only if `(a[i] % 3 + a[j] % 3 + a[k] % 3) % 3 == 0`.

We'll examine `a[x] % 3` based on `x % 3`:
1.  **If `x % 3 == 0`**: Let `x = 3m`.
    `a[x] = (3m)^2 - (3m) + 1 = 9m^2 - 3m + 1`.
    `a[x] % 3 = (9m^2 - 3m + 1) % 3 = 1`.
2.  **If `x % 3 == 1`**: Let `x = 3m + 1`.
    `a[x] = (3m + 1)^2 - (3m + 1) + 1 = (9m^2 + 6m + 1) - (3m + 1) + 1 = 9m^2 + 3m + 1`.
    `a[x] % 3 = (9m^2 + 3m + 1) % 3 = 1`.
3.  **If `x % 3 == 2`**: Let `x = 3m + 2`.
    `a[x] = (3m + 2)^2 - (3m + 2) + 1 = (9m^2 + 12m + 4) - (3m + 2) + 1 = 9m^2 + 9m + 3`.
    `a[x] % 3 = (9m^2 + 9m + 3) % 3 = 0`.

So, the pattern for `a[x] % 3` is:
*   `a[x] % 3 == 0` if `x % 3 == 2`.
*   `a[x] % 3 == 1` if `x % 3 == 0` or `x % 3 == 1`.
*   `a[x] % 3` is *never* 2.

This simplifies the problem significantly. We only have elements with remainder 0 or 1 when divided by 3.
Let `rem_i`, `rem_j`, `rem_k` be the remainders of `a[i]`, `a[j]`, `a[k]` modulo 3, respectively.
We need `(rem_i + rem_j + rem_k) % 3 == 0`.
Since `rem_x` can only be 0 or 1, the only combinations that sum to a multiple of 3 are:
1.  `(0, 0, 0)`: `0 + 0 + 0 = 0`, which is a multiple of 3.
2.  `(1, 1, 1)`: `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`, which is a multiple of 3.

All other combinations (e.g., `(0, 0, 1)`, `(0, 1, 1)`) do not sum to a multiple of 3. This means we must choose three elements `a[i], a[j], a[k]` such that they *all* have a remainder of 0 modulo 3, or they *all* have a remainder of 1 modulo 3.

**Algorithm:**
1.  Count how many `x` in the range `[1, n]` satisfy `x % 3 == 0`, `x % 3 == 1`, and `x % 3 == 2`.
    *   Let `N_0` be the count of `x` where `x % 3 == 0`. `N_0 = n // 3`.
    *   Let `N_1` be the count of `x` where `x % 3 == 1`. `N_1 = (n + 2) // 3`.
    *   Let `N_2` be the count of `x` where `x % 3 == 2`. `N_2 = (n + 1) // 3`.
    *(These formulas correctly calculate the counts for `x` from 1 to `n`.)*

2.  Based on the `a[x] % 3` pattern:
    *   The number of `a[x]` values such that `a[x] % 3 == 0` is `count_rem0 = N_2`.
    *   The number of `a[x]` values such that `a[x] % 3 == 1` is `count_rem1 = N_0 + N_1`.

3.  Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 distinct elements from `count_rem0` elements: `C(count_rem0, 3)`.
4.  Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 distinct elements from `count_rem1` elements: `C(count_rem1, 3)`.

5.  The total number of valid triples is the sum of these two counts. If `n < 3`, no triples are possible, so the result is 0.

A helper function for combinations `C(n, k)` (n choose k) is useful: `C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)`. If `k > n` or `k < 0`, `C(n, k) = 0`. For `k=3`, `C(n, 3) = n * (n-1) * (n-2) / 6`.

**Example `n = 5`:**
1.  Counts of `x` modulo 3:
    *   `N_0 = 5 // 3 = 1` (for `x=3`)
    *   `N_1 = (5 + 2) // 3 = 2` (for `x=1, 4`)
    *   `N_2 = (5 + 1) // 3 = 2` (for `x=2, 5`)
    (Total `1+2+2=5`, correct)

2.  Counts of `a[x]` modulo 3:
    *   `count_rem0 = N_2 = 2` (elements `a[2], a[5]` have `a[x] % 3 == 0`)
    *   `count_rem1 = N_0 + N_1 = 1 + 2 = 3` (elements `a[1], a[3], a[4]` have `a[x] % 3 == 1`)

3.  Calculate combinations:
    *   `C(count_rem0, 3) = C(2, 3) = 0` (cannot choose 3 from 2)
    *   `C(count_rem1, 3) = C(3, 3) = 1` (choose all 3 from 3)

4.  Total triples = `0 + 1 = 1`. This matches the example output.

   - If the index is a multiple of 4 (and not a multiple of 3), it cubes the value and adds it to `total_sum`.

### Explanation:
- **Edge Case Handling**: If the input list is empty, the function returns an empty list.
- **Initialization**: The first element is treated as the initial maximum and added to the result.
- **Iteration**: For each subsequent element, compare it with the current maximum. If it's greater, update the maximum. Always append the (potentially updated) maximum to the result list.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input list, as we make a single pass through the list.

### Explanation:
- **Step 1:** First, we divide `n` by 2 as many times as possible and set the largest prime factor to 2 if it divides.
- **Step 2:** Then, we check for odd factors starting from 3 up to the square root of `n` (optimized loop condition).
- **Step 3:** For each factor that divides `n`, we update the largest prime factor and continue dividing.
- **Step 4:** After the loop, if `n` is greater than 1, it means `n` itself is a prime factor, so we update the largest one.

### Explanation:
- **Line 1:** Check if the string is empty and return 0 immediately, as there are no characters.

    binary_str = bin(decimal)[2:]  # bin() gives a string like '0b101', so [2:] removes '0b'
    return 'db' + binary_str + 'db'
```

### Explanation:
- `bin(decimal)` converts the decimal number to a binary string (e.g., `bin(15)` returns `'0b1111'`).
- `[2:]` slices the string to remove the leading `'0b'` prefix, leaving just the binary digits (e.g., `'1111'`).
- The result is then wrapped with `'db'` at the start and end.

### Explanation:
- **Logic**: The function uses Python's `set` data structure to extract the unique characters from each string. It then compares the two sets. If they are equal, the strings have the same unique characters.
- **Edge Cases Handled**:
  - Empty strings: `same_chars('', '')` returns `True`.
  - Strings with no common unique characters: e.g., `same_chars('', 'a')` returns `False`.

humaneval,HumanEval/50,FrugalGPT,1,"It looks like you're defining a pair of functions for encoding and decoding strings by shifting characters in the alphabet. The `encode_shift` function is already implemented, which shifts each lowercase letter by 5 positions forward (wrapping around the alphabet using modulo 26).

To complete the `decode_shift` function, we need to reverse the encoding process. This means shifting each character back by 5 positions in the alphabet, again wrapping around as needed.

Here's the completed implementation:

### Explanation:
- This function processes each character in the input string `s`.
- For each character `ch`, it calculates the new character by:
  - Subtracting 5 from its position in the alphabet (after converting to a 0-25 index using `ord(ch) - ord(""a"")`).
  - Applying modulo 26 to handle wrapping (e.g., shifting 'a' back by 5 would go to 'v', but wrapping ensures it works correctly).
  - Converting back to a character by adding `ord(""a"")`.
- The result is a new string with all characters decoded.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Original string
original = ""hello""

# Encode it
encoded = encode_shift(original)  # Results in ""mjqqt""

# Decode it
decoded = decode_shift(encoded)   # Results in ""hello""

humaneval,HumanEval/115,FrugalGPT,1,"To solve the problem of determining how many times we need to lower the buckets to empty the wells represented by a grid, we can follow these steps:

1. **Count the Water Units**: Iterate through the grid and count the total number of `1`s, which represent the units of water in the wells.

2. **Calculate Bucket Lowers**: For each unit of water, we need to lower a bucket. Since each bucket has a certain capacity, we can determine how many times we need to lower the buckets by dividing the total water units by the bucket capacity and rounding up (since any remainder means we need an additional lowering).

3. **Return the Result**: The result will be the total number of times we need to lower the buckets.

Here is the implementation of the above logic in Python:

```python
def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    total_water_units = 0
    
    # Count the total number of water units (1s) in the grid
    for row in grid:
        total_water_units += sum(row)
    
    # Calculate the number of times we need to lower the buckets
    # We use math.ceil to round up the division
    import math
    lowers_needed = math.ceil(total_water_units / capacity)

### Explanation of the Code:

- We iterate through each row of the grid and sum the values in that row to count the total number of `1`s.
- We then calculate the number of lowers needed using `math.ceil` to ensure we round up when dividing the total water units by the bucket capacity.
- Finally, we return the total number of lowers needed.

humaneval,HumanEval/42,FrugalGPT,1,"Here's the complete implementation of the `incr_list` function based on the provided docstring. I've written clean, executable Python code that creates a new list with each element incremented by 1, without modifying the original list.

```python
def incr_list(l: list):
    """"""Return a new list with each element incremented by 1.
    
    >>> incr_list([1, 2, 3])
    [2, 3, 4]
    >>> incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])
    [6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]
    """"""
    return [x + 1 for x in l]  # Use a list comprehension to create a new list
```

### Explanation:
- **Functionality**: The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element in the input list `l` and adds 1 to it.
- **Edge Cases Handled**:
  - Empty list: `incr_list([])` returns `[]`.
  - Lists with floats: It works (e.g., `incr_list([1.5, 2.5])` returns `[2.5, 3.5]`).
  - Negative numbers: It works (e.g., `incr_list([-1, -2])` returns `[0, -1]`).
- **Why a new list?**: This implementation does not modify the original list, ensuring immutability as implied by the docstring.

You can test this function in a Python environment to verify it matches the examples. If you have any additional requirements or modifications, let me know!",0.0005085,13.855997085571287,0,0,grok-3-mini,,

```python
def total_match(lst1, lst2):
    '''
    Write a function that accepts two lists of strings and returns the list that has 
    total number of chars in the all strings of the list less than the other list.

    if the two lists have the same number of chars, return the first list.

    Examples
    total_match([], []) ➞ []
    total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'Hi']) ➞ ['hI', 'Hi']
    total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hi', 'hi', 'admin', 'project']) ➞ ['hi', 'admin']
    total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'hi', 'hi']) ➞ ['hI', 'hi', 'hi']
    total_match(['4'], ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']) ➞ ['4']
    '''

    # Calculate the total number of characters in each list
    total_chars_lst1 = sum(len(s) for s in lst1)
    total_chars_lst2 = sum(len(s) for s in lst2)

    # Compare the total character counts and return the appropriate list
    if total_chars_lst1 < total_chars_lst2:
        return lst1
    else:
        return lst2

# Example usage
print(total_match([], []))  # ➞ []
print(total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'Hi']))  # ➞ ['hI', 'Hi']
print(total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hi', 'hi', 'admin', 'project']))  # ➞ ['hi', 'admin']
print(total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'hi', 'hi']))  # ➞ ['hI', 'hi', 'hi']
print(total_match(['4'], ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']))  # ➞ ['4']
```

### Explanation:
1. The function `total_match` takes two lists of strings as input.
2. It calculates the total number of characters in each list using a generator expression within the `sum` function.
3. It compares the total character counts:
   - If the first list has fewer characters, it returns the first list.
   - Otherwise, it returns the second list (including the case where both lists have the same total character count).
4. The function handles edge cases, such as empty lists, as specified in the examples.",0.0012774,22.52547264099121,0,0,gpt-4o-mini,,
humaneval,HumanEval/158,FrugalGPT,1,"Here is a Python function that implements the requirements specified in your prompt. The function `find_max` takes a list of strings and returns the word with the maximum number of unique characters. In case of a tie, it returns the word that comes first in lexicographical order.

```python
def find_max(words):
    """"""Return the word with maximum number of unique characters.
    If multiple strings have maximum unique characters, return the one
    which comes first in lexicographical order.
    """"""

    max_unique_count = 0

    for word in words:
        unique_chars = set(word)  # Get unique characters in the word
        unique_count = len(unique_chars)  # Count of unique characters

        # Check if this word has more unique characters or is lexicographically smaller
        if (unique_count > max_unique_count) or (unique_count == max_unique_count and word < max_word):
            max_word = word
            max_unique_count = unique_count

    return max_word

# Example usage:
print(find_max([""name"", ""of"", ""string""]))  # Output: ""string""
print(find_max([""name"", ""enam"", ""game""]))  # Output: ""enam""
print(find_max([""aaaaaaa"", ""bb"", ""cc""]))   # Output: ""aaaaaaa""
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing `max_word` to an empty string and `max_unique_count` to zero.
2. **Iterate through words**: For each word in the input list, we convert it to a set to find the unique characters and count them.
3. **Comparison**: We check if the current word has more unique characters than the current maximum or if it has the same number of unique characters but is lexicographically smaller.
4. **Update**: If either condition is true, we update `max_word` and `max_unique_count`.
5. **Return**: Finally, we return the word with the maximum unique characters.",0.00111775,20.186042070388797,0,0,gpt-4o-mini,,
