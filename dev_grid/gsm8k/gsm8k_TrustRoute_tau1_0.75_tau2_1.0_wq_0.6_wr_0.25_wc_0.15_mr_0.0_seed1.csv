1. **Calculate the total number of eggs laid per day**: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.

2. **Calculate the number of eggs she uses**:
   - Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast.
   - She bakes muffins using 4 eggs.
   - Total eggs used = 3 (for breakfast) + 4 (for muffins) = 7 eggs.

3. **Calculate the number of eggs remaining**:
   - Remaining eggs = Total eggs laid - Total eggs used
   - Remaining eggs = 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

4. **Calculate the revenue from selling the remaining eggs**:
   - Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 per egg.
   - Total revenue = Remaining eggs × Price per egg
   - Total revenue = 9 × 2 = $18.

Therefore, Janet makes **$18** every day at the farmers' market.",0.00130635,8.10517406463623,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,

1. **Calculate the total investment**: This includes the purchase price of the house and the cost of repairs.

1. **Calculate the amount of water in the orange drink:**
   - The orange drink is 10 liters, and it is two-thirds water.
   - Amount of water in the orange drink = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 \) liters = \( \frac{20}{3} \) liters ≈ 6.67 liters.

2. **Calculate the amount of water in the pineapple drink:**
   - The pineapple drink is 15 liters, and it is three-fifths water.
   - Amount of water in the pineapple drink = \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 \) liters = \( 9 \) liters.

3. **Total amount of water before spilling:**
   - Total water = Water in orange drink + Water in pineapple drink
   - Total water = \( \frac{20}{3} + 9 \)
   - Convert 9 to a fraction: \( 9 = \frac{27}{3} \)
   - Total water = \( \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \) liters ≈ 15.67 liters.

4. **Account for the spilled orange drink:**
   - Since 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, we need to find out how much water was in that spilled liter.

1. **First Stop**: Henry stopped after 20 miles.
2. **Total Trip Distance**: The total distance of the trip is 60 miles.
3. **Second Stop**: The second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Therefore, the distance from the start to the second stop can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Distance to second stop} = \text{Total distance} - \text{Distance before end} = 60 \text{ miles} - 15 \text{ miles} = 45 \text{ miles}

According to the problem, the cost of the two pairs of high heels together is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. We can express this relationship as:

\[
B = \text{Cost of heels} + 5
\]

Next, we know that one pair of heels costs $33, and the other pair costs twice as much. Therefore, the cost of the second pair of heels is:

\[
2 \times 33 = 66
\]

Now, we can find the total cost of the two pairs of heels:

\[
\text{Cost of heels} = 33 + 66 = 99

Substituting this back into our equation for the cost of the boots:

\[
B = 99 + 5

Combining the terms gives:

### Step 1: Identify the guesses
- The first friend guesses: 80 jelly beans.
- The second friend guesses: 20 more than half of the first friend's guess.
  - Half of 80 is 40.
  - 20 more than 40 is 40 + 20 = 60.
  - So, the second guess is 60.
- The third friend guesses: 25% more than the first friend's guess.
  - 25% of 80 is 0.25 × 80 = 20.
  - 25% more than 80 is 80 + 20 = 100.
  - So, the third guess is 100.

The three guesses are: 80, 60, and 100.

### Step 2: Calculate the average
- Add the guesses together: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

### Step 1: Understand the initial situation
- The Doubtfire sisters have adopted 7 kittens from the local animal shelter.

### Step 2: Account for Patchy's kittens
- Patchy, one of the house cats, has had thrice the number of adopted kittens.
- The number of adopted kittens is 7.
- Thrice 7 is calculated as: 7 × 3 = 21.
- So, Patchy has had 21 kittens.

### Step 3: Account for Trixie's kittens
- Trixie, the other house cat, has had 12 kittens.
- This is straightforward, so we add 12 kittens.

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of kittens
- The family now has:
  - The 7 adopted kittens.
  - Patchy's 21 kittens.
  - Trixie's 12 kittens.
- Total kittens = 7 + 21 + 12 = 40.

**Given information:**
- Bridge weight limit: 5000 pounds
- Weight of each box: 15 pounds
- Weight of driver + empty truck: 3755 pounds

**Step-by-step solution:**

1) First, I'll find how much weight capacity is available for boxes:

1. Calculate how many packages of 3 are needed for 18 flowers:
   \[
   \text{Number of packages} = \frac{18}{3} = 6

2. Calculate the total cost for 6 packages:
   \[

### Step 2: Set up the equation
- Together, they sold 88,000 copies, so:
  \[

The outer dimensions of each box are:
- Length = 6 inches
- Width = 5 inches
- Height = 4 inches

Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we need to subtract twice the thickness (1 inch on each side) from each dimension to get the inner dimensions:

1. **Inner Length**:
   \[
   \text{Inner Length} = 6 \text{ inches} - 2 \times 1 \text{ inch} = 6 - 2 = 4 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Inner Width**:
   \[
   \text{Inner Width} = 5 \text{ inches} - 2 \times 1 \text{ inch} = 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Inner Height**:
   \[
   \text{Inner Height} = 4 \text{ inches} - 2 \times 1 \text{ inch} = 4 - 2 = 2 \text{ inches}

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:

- After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, leaving him with \( (2x + 15) - 5 \) cookies.
- We know he ended up with 110 cookies, so we can set up the equation:
  \[
  (2x + 15) - 5 = 110
  \]

### Step 2: Solve the equation
- Simplify the left side:
  \[
  2x + 15 - 5 = 110
  \]
  \[
  2x + 10 = 110
  \]
- Subtract 10 from both sides:
  \[
  2x = 100
  \]
- Divide both sides by 2:
  \[
  x = 50
  \]

### Step 3: Verify the solution
- If Henry baked 50 cookies last year, he intended to bake \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) cookies this year.
- He baked 15 more than intended: \( 100 + 15 = 115 \) cookies.
- After dropping 5 cookies: \( 115 - 5 = 110 \) cookies, which matches the problem statement.

Therefore, Henry baked **50 cookies last year**.",0.006987700000000001,12.74403190612793,0,0,cand-grok-3-mini,stage2_vote,

*   Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, meaning A_old = L_old * (1 + 0.30) = 1.3 * L_old.
*   So, L_old = A_old / 1.3

**2. Calculate Adrien's current salary (A_new):**
*   Adrien's salary increased by 40% from his old salary.

*   A_new = $40,000 * 1.4

**3. Calculate Lylah's current salary (L_new):**
*   The problem states, ""If Adrien's and Lylah's salary increased simultaneously"". In the absence of a specific increase rate for Lylah, the most reasonable assumption for the problem to be solvable is that Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's over the same four-year period.

   \text{Questions completed} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} = 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ questions}
   \]

   Therefore, the number of questions left incomplete on the first test is:

   Therefore, the number of questions left incomplete on the second test is:

gsm8k,gsm8k-141,TrustRoute,1,"Let's denote the number of queen bees as \( q \), the number of baby bees as \( b \), and the number of worker bees as \( w \).

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The total number of bees is 700:
   \[
   q + b + w = 700
   \]

2. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees:
   \[
   w = 2b
   \]

3. There are twice as many baby bees as queens:
   \[
   b = 2q
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( w \) and \( b \) in terms of \( q \) into the first equation.

From \( b = 2q \), we can substitute \( b \) into the equation for \( w \):
\[
w = 2b = 2(2q) = 4q
\]

Now we can substitute \( b \) and \( w \) into the total number of bees equation:
\[
q + b + w = 700
\]
Substituting \( b \) and \( w \):
\[
q + 2q + 4q = 700
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
7q = 700
\]

Now, we can solve for \( q \):
\[
q = \frac{700}{7} = 100
\]

Now that we have \( q \), we can find \( b \) and \( w \):
\[
b = 2q = 2(100) = 200
\]
\[
w = 4q = 4(100) = 400
\]

Thus, the number of worker bees is:

### Explanation:
- Let Brooke's current age be \(b\) years.
- Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's current age is \(2b\) years.
- In 2 years:
  - Brooke's age will be \(b + 2\).
  - Seth's age will be \(2b + 2\).
- The sum of their ages in 2 years is given as 28, so:

gsm8k,gsm8k-192,TrustRoute,1,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.

2. **Net trees planted per year**: 
   - Tom plants 10 trees each year.
   - He chops down 2 trees each year.
   - Therefore, the net increase in trees per year is:
     \[
     10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
     \]

3. **Total trees after 10 years**:
   - Over 10 years, the total increase in trees is:
     \[
     8 \text{ trees/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 80 \text{ trees}
     \]
   - Adding this to the initial number of trees:
     \[
     50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees}

4. **Percentage of trees that die**:
   - After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. 
   - The number of trees that die is:
     \[
     30\% \text{ of } 130 = 0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees}

1. **Initial Flamingos**: On Friday morning, Sue has 18 pink flamingos in her yard.

2. **Saturday's Changes**:
   - The neighbors take back one third of the flamingos. 
   - One third of 18 is calculated as:
     \[
     \frac{18}{3} = 6
     \]
   - So, 6 flamingos are taken back and painted white. 
   - After this, the number of pink flamingos left is:
     \[
     18 - 6 = 12
     \]
   - Now, there are 6 white flamingos added back to the yard.

3. **Sunday's Changes**:
   - On Sunday morning, the neighbors add another 18 pink flamingos to the yard.
   - The total number of pink flamingos now is:
     \[
     12 + 18 = 30

4. **Final Count**:
   - At noon on Sunday, there are 30 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

5. **Calculating the Difference**:
   - To find out how many more pink flamingos there are than white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos:

   - Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers. Since he edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits:
     \[
     \text{Sentences per publisher} = \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences}
     \]
   - Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, the payment from Publisher A is:

     \text{Payment from A} = 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents}
     \]

2. **Determine the payment from Publisher B:**
   - Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays. Thus, the rate for Publisher B is:
     \[
     \text{Rate from B} = 2 \times 5 \text{ cents} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence}
