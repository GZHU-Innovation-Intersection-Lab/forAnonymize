gsm8k,gsm8k-201,SC-3,1,"To calculate how much money John made that year, we need to consider both the one-time monetary reward and the increase in his salary due to the raise.

1. **Calculate the total salary for the year before the raise:**
   - John makes $2000 a week.
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - Total salary before the raise = $2000/week * 52 weeks = $104,000.

2. **Calculate the raise:**
   - John receives a 5% raise on his weekly salary.
   - Raise amount = 5% of $2000 = 0.05 * $2000 = $100.
   - New weekly salary after the raise = $2000 + $100 = $2100.

3. **Calculate the total salary for the year after the raise:**
   - Since he received the raise on the first day of the year, he will earn the new salary for the entire year.
   - Total salary after the raise = $2100/week * 52 weeks = $109,200.

4. **Add the one-time monetary reward:**

gsm8k,gsm8k-205,SC-3,1,"To find out what score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after dropping the lowest score, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total score needed for an average of 93**:
   Since Brinley will drop the lowest score, we need to consider only the top five scores for the average. To find the total score needed for an average of 93 over five tests, we can use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Total score needed} = \text{Average} \times \text{Number of tests}
   \]
   Here, the average is 93 and the number of tests is 5:
   \[
   \text{Total score needed} = 93 \times 5 = 465
   \]

2. **Calculate the sum of the first five test scores**:
   Brinley's scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. We first calculate the sum of these scores:
   \[
   \text{Sum of scores} = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438
   \]

3. **Determine the score needed on the sixth test**:
   Let \( x \) be the score Brinley needs on her sixth test. After dropping the lowest score, we need the sum of the highest five scores (which will include \( x \)) to equal 465. The lowest score among the first five is 71, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   438 + x - 71 = 465
   \]
   Simplifying this gives:
   \[
   438 + x - 71 = 465 \\

1. **Weight of Chocolate Bars**:
   - Joe has 25 chocolate bars.
   - Each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams.
   - Total weight of chocolate bars = Number of chocolate bars × Weight of each chocolate bar
   \[
   \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ grams}
   \]

2. **Weight of Candied Apples**:
   - Joe has 80 candied apples.
   - Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, we can find the weight of each candied apple.
   - Let the weight of each candied apple be \( x \) grams. Then:
   \[
   40 = 2x \implies x = \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ grams}

gsm8k,gsm8k-211,SC-3,1,"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \).

According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, so the total egg production from red chickens is \( 3r \).
2. The white chickens produce 5 eggs a day, so the total egg production from white chickens is \( 5w \).
3. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs a day, which gives us the equation:
   \[
   3r + 5w = 42
   \]
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which gives us the equation:
   \[
   w = r + 2
   \]

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation. Replacing \( w \) in the first equation gives us:
\[
3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
\]

Now, simplify this equation:
\[
3r + 5r + 10 = 42
\]
\[
8r + 10 = 42

Next, subtract 10 from both sides:
\[
8r = 32

To verify, we can check the total egg production:
- From red chickens: \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) eggs
- From white chickens: \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \) eggs
- Total: \( 12 + 30 = 42 \) eggs, which matches the given information.

     \]
   - Now, divide by 3:
     \[
     \text{Average age} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
     \]

Thus, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years will be **45 years old**.",0.0007382999999999,32.03643083572388,0,0,gpt-4o-mini,,,1

- Naomi's score: \( N = 68 \)
- Yuri's score: \( Y \)
- Brianna's score: \( B \)
- Jojo's score: \( J \)

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points:
   \[
   Y = \frac{N}{2} + 10
   \]
   Substituting \( N = 68 \):
   \[
   Y = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44

2. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi:
   \[
   B = N + 17
   \]
   Substituting \( N = 68 \):
   \[
   B = 68 + 17 = 85

3. **Extra cheese**: $1.00
4. **Avocado**: $1.00
5. **Sauces**: 2 sauces at $0.25 each = 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
6. **Upgrade for chips and drink**: $3.00

Now, let's add all these costs together:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 6.50 + 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 + 3.00

1. **Determine the number of pen pals Mike currently has:**
   - Mike initially had 5 pen pals.
   - He stopped being pen pals with 2 of them.
   - Therefore, he currently has: 
     \[
     5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of letters received per week:**
   - Each pen pal sends 2 letters a week.
   - With 3 pen pals, the total number of letters received per week is:
     \[
     3 \text{ pen pals} \times 2 \text{ letters/pen pal} = 6 \text{ letters}
     \]

3. **Determine the total number of pages he receives per week:**
   - Each letter is 5 pages long.
   - Therefore, the total number of pages received per week is:
     \[
     6 \text{ letters} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 30 \text{ pages}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of pages he writes in response:**
   - Mike responds in kind, so he writes the same number of pages he receives.
   - Thus, he writes:
     \[
     30 \text{ pages}
     \]

5. **Determine how long it takes him to write these pages:**
   - Mike can write 1 page every 6 minutes.
   - Therefore, the total time in minutes to write 30 pages is:
     \[
     30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes}
     \]

6. **Convert the total writing time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

1. **Current Year Sales**: 
   - Elise sold 45 books this year.

2. **Books Sold Last Year**: 
   - According to the problem, she sold twice as many books in the first year as she sold this year. Therefore, the number of books sold in the first year is:
     \[
     \text{Books sold in the first year} = 2 \times \text{Books sold this year} = 2 \times 45 = 90

3. **Total Books Sold**: 
   - The total number of books Elise has is 250, and there are currently 50 unsold books. Therefore, the total number of books sold over the three years is:
     \[
     \text{Total books sold} = 250 - 50 = 200
     \]

4. **Books Sold in the Second Year**: 
   - Let \( x \) be the number of books sold in the second year. We can set up the equation:
     \[
     \text{Books sold in the first year} + \text{Books sold in the second year} + \text{Books sold this year} = 200

   - Total hours worked in a week = 10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week.
   - His hourly wage is $10.
   - Weekly earnings without the bonus = 50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week.

2. **Add the weekly bonus:**
   - Watson receives a $300 bonus each week.
   - Total weekly earnings with the bonus = $500 + $300 = $800/week.

3. **Calculate the number of weeks in April:**
   - April has 30 days.
   - There are 4 full weeks in April (28 days) and 2 extra days.
   - Since Watson works 5 days a week, he will work 5 days in the first 4 weeks and 2 days in the last week.
   - Total working days in April = 5 days/week * 4 weeks + 2 days = 20 + 2 = 22 days.
   - Since he works 5 days a week, he will have 4 full weeks and 2 additional days of work.

4. **Calculate total earnings for April:**
   - Watson works 4 full weeks and earns $800 for each of those weeks.
   - Earnings for 4 weeks = 4 weeks * $800/week = $3200.
   - For the additional 2 days, he earns $10/hour for 10 hours/day.
   - Earnings for 2 days = 2 days * 10 hours/day * $10/hour = 2 * 10 * 10 = $200.

5. **Total earnings for April:**
   - Total earnings = Earnings for 4 weeks + Earnings for 2 days = $3200 + $200 = $3400.

According to the problem:

1. The number of players on the offense is \( 2d \) (twice as many as on the defense).
2. The number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{1}{2}d \) (half the number of players on the defense).

The total number of members in the football team is given as 105. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
d + 2d + \frac{1}{2}d = 105
\]

Now, let's combine the terms on the left side:

\[
d + 2d = 3d
\]
\[
3d + \frac{1}{2}d = \frac{6}{2}d + \frac{1}{2}d = \frac{7}{2}d
\]

So, the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{7}{2}d = 105

To solve for \( d \), we can multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

The total number of popsicles they have together is given as 165. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
5x + 6x = 165
\]

Combining the terms on the left side gives:

\[
11x = 165

1. **Cost of Streaming Services:**
   - Netflix: $10 per month

   - Disney Plus: $10 per month

   The total cost without bundling would be:
   \[
   \text{Total without bundling} = 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   Since Tim saves 20% by bundling Hulu and Disney Plus, we first calculate the bundled cost:
   \[
   \text{Savings from bundling} = 20\% \text{ of } (10 + 10) = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Therefore, the bundled cost for Hulu and Disney Plus is:

### Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May
- Number of employees hired in May: 40
- Hourly wage per employee: $15
- Hours worked per week: 40

**Total payment for May:**
\[
\text{Total payment for May} = \text{Number of employees} \times \text{Hourly wage} \times \text{Hours per week}
\]
\[
\text{Total payment for May} = 40 \times 15 \times 40
\]
\[
\text{Total payment for May} = 40 \times 600 = 24000
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total payment for June
In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. Therefore, the number of employees remaining is:
\[
\text{Remaining employees} = 40 - \left(\frac{1}{4} \times 40\right) = 40 - 10 = 30
\]

**Total payment for June:**
\[
\text{Total payment for June} = \text{Remaining employees} \times \text{Hourly wage} \times \text{Hours per week}
\]
\[
\text{Total payment for June} = 30 \times 15 \times 40
\]
\[
\text{Total payment for June} = 30 \times 600 = 18000

From the problem, we know the following:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half of that from the shortest trees, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
- Therefore, the total number of apples Joanne gathers is:
  \[
  30 + 15 + x = 45 + x
  \]

Now, let's calculate how many apples her sister gathers:

- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- Her sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- Her sister does not gather any apples from the average trees.

Thus, the total number of apples her sister gathers is:

gsm8k,gsm8k-416,SC-3,1,"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let:
- \( c \) = number of camels
- \( d \) = number of dromedaries

From the problem, we know:
1. Each animal has one head, so the total number of heads gives us the equation:
   \[
   c + d = 180
   \]

2. Camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump. The total number of humps gives us the equation:
   \[
   2c + d = 304
   \]

Now we have the following system of equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)  (Equation 1)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \)  (Equation 2)

We can solve this system step by step.

### Step 1: Solve Equation 1 for \( d \)
From Equation 1:
\[
d = 180 - c
\]

### Step 2: Substitute \( d \) in Equation 2
Now, substitute \( d \) in Equation 2:
\[
2c + (180 - c) = 304
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the equation
Combine like terms:
\[
2c - c + 180 = 304
\]
\[
c + 180 = 304
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( c \)
Subtract 180 from both sides:
\[
c = 304 - 180
\]
\[
c = 124

### Step 5: Find \( d \)
Now substitute \( c \) back into Equation 1 to find \( d \):
\[
d = 180 - c = 180 - 124 = 56

1. **Initial Preparation**: The caterer prepared enough hot dogs for half of the guests to have two hot dogs each. Since there were originally 36 guests, half of that is:
   \[
   \frac{36}{2} = 18 \text{ guests}
   \]
   If each of these 18 guests is to have 2 hot dogs, the total number of hot dogs prepared is:
   \[
   18 \times 2 = 36 \text{ hot dogs}
   \]

2. **Guests Who Showed Up**: However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hot dog. This means that all 40 guests wanted 2 hot dogs each, which totals:
   \[
   40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ hot dogs}
   \]

3. **Hot Dogs Available vs. Hot Dogs Needed**: The caterer only prepared 36 hot dogs, but 80 hot dogs are needed. To find out how many guests did not get a second hot dog, we need to determine how many guests can be served with the 36 hot dogs.

   Each guest can have 1 hot dog initially, and then we can see how many can have a second hot dog with the remaining hot dogs. 

   - First, all 40 guests can have 1 hot dog each, which uses up 40 hot dogs. Since only 36 hot dogs are available, not all guests can have 1 hot dog. 

   - The number of guests that can be served 1 hot dog with 36 hot dogs is:
   \[
   36 \text{ guests}
   \]

4. **Calculating Guests Who Did Not Get a Second Hot Dog**: Since 36 guests can be served 1 hot dog, there are:
   \[
   40 - 36 = 4 \text{ guests}
   \]
   who will not receive a hot dog at all. 

   Now, among the 36 guests who received 1 hot dog, we need to see how many can get a second hot dog. After serving 36 guests 1 hot dog each, there are no hot dogs left for the second round. Therefore, none of the guests can get a second hot dog.

Thus, the total number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is:
\[
\text{Total guests} - \text{Guests who got 1 hot dog} = 40 - 36 = 4

So, the answer is:

From the problem, we know:
- \( |A| = 9 \) (kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |B| = 6 \) (kids allergic to peanuts)

1. **Cost of one pack of razors**: 
   - Each pack costs $4.00.

2. **Number of packs Heather buys**: 
   - She buys 2 packs.

3. **Total cost without discounts**: 
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 2 \text{ packs} \times 4.00 \text{ dollars/pack} = 8.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Buy one get one free offer**: 
   - Since Heather buys 2 packs, she effectively pays for 1 pack and gets 1 pack free. Therefore, she only pays for 1 pack.
   \[
   \text{Cost after BOGO} = 4.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Applying the $2.00 coupon**: 
   - Subtract the coupon from the cost after the BOGO offer.
   \[

   \]

6. **Total number of razors**: 
   - Each pack contains 4 razors, so for 2 packs:
   \[

1. **Bottom Layer (4 girls)**: The height of the bottom layer is determined by the height of the tallest cheerleaders. Since 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, we will assume that the bottom layer consists of these 4 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall. Therefore, the height of the bottom layer is:
   \[

   \]

2. **Second Layer (3 girls)**: The second layer consists of 3 cheerleaders standing on top of the bottom layer. We will again assume these are the tallest cheerleaders (64 inches). Therefore, the height of the second layer is:
   \[
   \text{Height of second layer} = 64 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Third Layer (2 girls)**: The third layer consists of 2 cheerleaders standing on top of the second layer. We will assume these are also the tallest cheerleaders (64 inches). Therefore, the height of the third layer is:
   \[
   \text{Height of third layer} = 64 \text{ inches}

4. **Top Layer (1 girl)**: The top layer consists of the shortest cheerleader, who is 60 inches tall. Therefore, the height of the top layer is:
   \[
   \text{Height of top layer} = 60 \text{ inches}
   \]

Now, we need to calculate the total height of the pyramid. The total height is the sum of the heights of all layers:

\[

   \[
   L + D + B = 43

2. Lily found 7 more insects than David:
   \[
   L = D + 7
   \]

3. David found half of what Bodhi found:
   \[
   D = \frac{1}{2}B
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( L \) and \( D \) into the first equation.

First, substitute \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \) into the equation for \( L \):
\[
L = \frac{1}{2}B + 7
\]

Now substitute both \( L \) and \( D \) into the total equation:
\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}B + 7\right) + \frac{1}{2}B + B = 43
\]

Combine the terms:
\[
\frac{1}{2}B + \frac{1}{2}B + B + 7 = 43

   - A **2 x 4** costs $4 and produces **200 sticks**.
   - A **2 x 8** costs $6 and produces **400 sticks**.

2. **Cost per Stick**:
   - For a **2 x 4**:
     \[

From this analysis, we see that the **2 x 8** is cheaper per stick.

3. **Maximizing Sticks with $24**:
   - If Frederick buys only **2 x 8** pieces:

   where \( S_O \) is the number of sofas Ophelia has.

2. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia:
   \[
   C_J = 3C_O
   \]

3. Ophelia has 20 sofas:
   \[
   S_O = 20
   \]

From the first equation, we can substitute \( S_O \) into the equation for Ophelia's sofas:
\[
20 = C_O - 2
\]
Now, we can solve for \( C_O \):
\[
C_O = 20 + 2 = 22
\]

Now that we have the number of chairs Ophelia has, we can find the number of chairs Jenna has using the second equation:
\[
C_J = 3C_O = 3 \times 22 = 66
\]

Next, we can find the number of sofas Jenna has. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs:
\[
S_J = C_J - 2 = 66 - 2 = 64

- Total chairs:
  \[
  C_O + C_J = 22 + 66 = 88

   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years. Therefore, his current age is:
     \[
     27 - 5 = 22 \text{ years old}
     \]

2. **Determine Jame's cousin's age in 8 years**:
   - Let \( x \) be Jame's cousin's current age. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be:
     \[
     x + 8
     \]

3. **Set up the equation based on the cousin's age**:
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. In 8 years, Jame will be:
     \[
     22 + 8 = 30 \text{ years old}
     \]
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is:
     \[
     2 \times 30 = 60
     \]
   - Therefore, Jame's cousin's age in 8 years can be expressed as:
     \[
     x + 8 = 60 - 5
     \]
     \[
     x + 8 = 55
     \]

4. **Solve for the cousin's current age**:
   - Rearranging the equation gives:
     \[
     x = 55 - 8 = 47 \text{ years old}
     \]

5. **Calculate the age difference**:
   - Now we know Jame is 22 years old and his cousin is 47 years old. The difference in their ages is:
     \[
     47 - 22 = 25 \text{ years}
     \]

Thus, the age difference between Jame and his cousin is **25 years**.",0.00075135,17.581976413726807,0,0,gpt-4o-mini,,,1

1. **Cost of the Computer**: 
   - The computer costs $1,100.

2. **Cost of the Printer**: 
   - The printer costs $400 less than the computer. 
   - Therefore, the cost of the printer is:
     \[
     1,100 - 400 = 700 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Total Cost of All Items**: 
   - Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for a total of $2,400. 
   - We can express this as:
     \[
     \text{Cost of Computer} + \text{Cost of 2 Monitors} + \text{Cost of Printer} = 2,400
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     1,100 + 2 \times \text{Cost of One Monitor} + 700 = 2,400
     \]

4. **Simplifying the Equation**:
   - Combine the known costs:
     \[
     1,100 + 700 = 1,800
     \]
   - Now, substitute this back into the equation:
     \[
     1,800 + 2 \times \text{Cost of One Monitor} = 2,400
     \]

5. **Solving for the Cost of One Monitor**:
   - Subtract 1,800 from both sides:
     \[
     2 \times \text{Cost of One Monitor} = 2,400 - 1,800
     \]
     \[
     2 \times \text{Cost of One Monitor} = 600
     \]
   - Now, divide both sides by 2:
     \[
     \text{Cost of One Monitor} = \frac{600}{2} = 300

2. **Shells Brought by Boys**: Each boy brought back 60 seashells. Since there are 10 boys, the total number of shells brought back by the boys is:
   \[
   \text{Total shells by boys} = 10 \times 60 = 600
   \]

3. **Shells Brought by Girls**: According to the problem, the number of shells brought back by the girls is equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times the number of shells brought by the boys. Therefore, we can express the total number of shells brought by the girls as:
   \[
   \text{Total shells by girls} = \text{Total shells by boys} + 4 \times \text{Total shells by boys}

   - The first half consists of the first 15 days (April 1 to April 15).
   - The second half consists of the last 15 days (April 16 to April 30).

3. **Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half**. Therefore, for the first half of the month, he saves:
   \[

1. **Cold Water:**
   - Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.
   - Therefore, for 3 miles in cold water:
     \[
     \text{Time for 3 miles (cold)} = 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Warm Water:**
   - Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as in cold water.
   - Twice the time for cold water is:
     \[
     2 \times 16 = 32 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Adding 2 minutes gives:
     \[

   - Let \( R \) be the daily recommended amount of coffee in cups.
   - Octavia drinks half of this amount, so she drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups.

2. **Determine Juan's coffee intake**: 
   - Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks. Therefore, Juan drinks:
   \[

1. **Initial Funding for the First 5 Months:**
   - John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months. 
   - Total cost for the first 5 months = $100,000.

2. **Duration of Research:**
   - The research takes 10 times longer than the initial 5 months.
   - Total duration of research = 10 * 5 months = 50 months.

3. **Funding for the Additional Months:**
   - The additional months after the first 5 months = 50 months - 5 months = 45 months.
   - The funding for each of these months increases by 50% compared to the previous month.

   Let's calculate the funding for each of the additional months:
   - Month 6: 50% more than the last month (Month 5).
   - Funding for Month 5 = $100,000 / 5 = $20,000 (monthly funding for the first 5 months).
   - Month 6 funding = $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000.
   - Month 7 funding = $30,000 * 1.5 = $45,000.
   - Month 8 funding = $45,000 * 1.5 = $67,500.
   - Month 9 funding = $67,500 * 1.5 = $101,250.
   - Month 10 funding = $101,250 * 1.5 = $151,875.
   - And so on...

   This forms a geometric series where:
   - First term (Month 6) = $30,000.
   - Common ratio = 1.5.
   - Number of terms = 45.

   The sum \( S_n \) of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S_n = a \frac{(r^n - 1)}{(r - 1)}
   \]
   where:
   - \( a \) = first term,
   - \( r \) = common ratio,
   - \( n \) = number of terms.

   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   S_{45} = 30,000 \frac{(1.5^{45} - 1)}{(1.5 - 1)}
   \]

   Now we can calculate \( 1.5^{45} \):
   \[
   1.5^{45} \approx 11222.741
   \]

   Thus,
   \[
   S_{45} = 30,000 \frac{(11222.741 - 1)}{0.5} \approx 30,000 \times 22445.482 = 673364460

gsm8k,gsm8k-633,SC-3,1,"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we can set up the problem using their speeds and the distance between them.

1. **Identify the speeds**:
   - Bob's speed = 55 miles per hour
   - Tom's speed = 70 miles per hour

2. **Identify the distance between them**:
   - Distance = 75 miles (Bob is ahead of Tom)

3. **Determine the relative speed**:
   - The relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob is the difference in their speeds:
   \[
   \text{Relative speed} = \text{Tom's speed} - \text{Bob's speed} = 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph}

Given that Manny signed up for Karate classes for a total of $60, we can calculate the total number of classes he can attend while keeping the cost per class at or below $10.

1. **Calculate the maximum total cost for the classes:**
   \[
   \text{Maximum total cost} = \text{Number of classes} \times \text{Cost per class}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Maximum total cost} = 10 \times 10 = 100

2. **Determine how many classes Manny can attend:**
   Since the total cost for all classes is $60, we can find out how many classes he can attend while keeping the cost per class at or below $10.

3. **Calculate the number of classes he can attend:**
   \[
   \text{Cost per class} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of classes attended}}

gsm8k,gsm8k-660,SC-3,1,"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let:
- \( s \) = number of sheep
- \( g \) = number of geese

We know the following:
1. Each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs. The total number of legs is 70.
2. Each animal has 1 head. The total number of heads is 20.

From this information, we can create the following equations:

1. For the total number of legs:
   \[
   4s + 2g = 70
   \]

2. For the total number of heads:
   \[
   s + g = 20
   \]

Now, we can solve this system of equations.

From the second equation, we can express \( g \) in terms of \( s \):
\[
g = 20 - s
\]

Now, we can substitute this expression for \( g \) into the first equation:
\[
4s + 2(20 - s) = 70
\]

Expanding this gives:
\[
4s + 40 - 2s = 70
\]

Combining like terms:
\[
2s + 40 = 70
\]

Subtracting 40 from both sides:
\[
2s = 30
\]

Dividing by 2:
\[
s = 15
\]

Now that we have the number of sheep, we can find the number of geese by substituting \( s \) back into the equation for \( g \):
\[
g = 20 - s = 20 - 15 = 5
\]

Thus, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( \boxed{15} \).",0.0007185,30.48724389076233,0,0,gpt-4o-mini,,,1

gsm8k,gsm8k-675,SC-3,1,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Situation**:
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. 
   - There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so the total number of dogs is:
     \[
     4 + 8 = 12 \text{ dogs}
     \]
   - Therefore, James needs 12 toys for 12 dogs.

2. **After Buying Toys**:
   - James initially has 4 toys and needs 12, so he needs to buy:
     \[
     12 - 4 = 8 \text{ more toys}
     \]

3. **After Leaving and Returning**:
   - When James left, he bought 8 toys, so now he has 12 toys (4 original + 8 bought).
   - He then sees that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. Initially, there were 8 more dogs (the ones he saw when he left). Twice that number is:
     \[
     2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ more dogs}
     \]
   - Adding these 16 dogs to the original 4 dogs gives:
     \[
     4 + 16 = 20 \text{ dogs}
     \]
   - Now, James needs 20 toys for 20 dogs.

4. **Final Situation**:
   - James has 12 toys and needs 20, so he needs to buy:
     \[
     20 - 12 = 8 \text{ more toys}
     \]

5. **After Some Dogs Leave**:
   - When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so the number of dogs is now:
     \[
     20 - 3 = 17 \text{ dogs}
     \]
   - Therefore, James now needs 17 toys for 17 dogs.

6. **Final Calculation**:
   - James currently has 12 toys. To find out how many more toys he needs:

- Let \( K \) be the number of cookies Katarina has.
- Let \( M \) be the number of cookies Max has.
- Let \( C \) be the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of cookies Summer has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. \( K = M - 5 \) (Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max)
2. \( M = C + 12 \) (Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster)
3. \( S = M + 23 \) (Summer has 23 more cookies than Max)
4. \( K = 68 \) (Katarina has 68 cookies)

Now, we can substitute \( K \) into the first equation:

\[
68 = M - 5
\]

Adding 5 to both sides gives:

\[
M = 68 + 5 = 73
\]

Now that we have \( M \), we can find \( C \) using the second equation:

\[
M = C + 12
\]

Substituting \( M = 73 \):

\[
73 = C + 12
\]

Subtracting 12 from both sides gives:

\[
C = 73 - 12 = 61
\]

Next, we can find \( S \) using the third equation:

\[
S = M + 23
\]

Substituting \( M = 73 \):

\[
S = 73 + 23 = 96

From the problem, we know the following:

1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet. Let's say \( T_1 = R_1 + 7 \).
2. The combined ages of the twins and triplets is 44: 
   \[
   T_1 + T_2 + R_1 + R_2 + R_3 = 44
   \]
3. Since the twins are the same age, we have \( T_1 = T_2 \).

Let \( T \) represent the age of each twin. Then we can rewrite the equations as:

1. \( T = R_1 + 7 \)
2. \( 2T + R_1 + R_2 + R_3 = 44 \)

Now, we can express \( R_1 \), \( R_2 \), and \( R_3 \) in terms of \( T \):

From \( T = R_1 + 7 \), we can express \( R_1 \) as:
\[
R_1 = T - 7
\]

Substituting \( R_1 \) into the combined ages equation:
\[
2T + (T - 7) + R_2 + R_3 = 44
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
3T + R_2 + R_3 - 7 = 44
\]
Adding 7 to both sides gives:
\[
3T + R_2 + R_3 = 51
\]

Since \( R_2 \) and \( R_3 \) are also triplets, we can assume they are the same age as \( R_1 \) (which is \( T - 7 \)). Thus, we can express \( R_2 \) and \( R_3 \) as:
\[
R_2 = R_3 = T - 7
\]

Now substituting \( R_2 \) and \( R_3 \) into the equation:
\[
3T + (T - 7) + (T - 7) = 51
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
3T + 2(T - 7) = 51

Expanding gives:
\[

\]
Combining like terms:
\[
5T - 14 = 51

Adding 14 to both sides:
\[

T = 13

   Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds.

2. **Gordy's Truck Capacity**: 
   Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck. Therefore, Gordy's truck capacity is:
   \[
   4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Combined Capacity of All Trucks**: 
   We know that the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds. We can express this as:
   \[
   \text{Gissela's capacity} + \text{Gordy's capacity} + \text{Gary's capacity} = 11600
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   4000 + 4800 + \text{Gary's capacity} = 11600

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250:
   \[
   x + y + z = 250
   \]

2. The first house needs half of what the second house needs:
   \[
   x = \frac{1}{2}y
   \]

3. The third house needs double what the first house needs:
   \[
   z = 2x
   \]

Now, we can substitute \( x \) and \( z \) in terms of \( y \) into the total equation.

From the second equation, we can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
\[
y = 2x
\]

Now substituting \( x \) and \( z \) into the total equation:
\[
x + y + z = 250
\]
Substituting \( y \) and \( z \):
\[
x + 2x + 2x = 250

gsm8k,gsm8k-779,SC-3,1,"To find the distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot, we can break the problem down into two parts: the driving distance and the hiking distance.

1. **Driving Speed and Time**:
   - The average driving speed is 50 miles per hour.
   - The total time for the trip is 6 hours, and they spent 1.5 hours hiking. Therefore, the time spent driving is:
     \[
     \text{Driving time} = 6 \text{ hours} - 1.5 \text{ hours} = 4.5 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Distance Driven**:
   - The distance driven can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
     \]
   - Plugging in the values:
     \[
     \text{Distance driven} = 50 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4.5 \text{ hours} = 225 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Hiking Speed**:
   - The hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half of their driving speed. Half of the driving speed is:
     \[
     \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ miles/hour}
     \]
   - Therefore, the hiking speed is:
     \[
     25 \text{ miles/hour} - 5 \text{ miles/hour} = 20 \text{ miles/hour}
     \]

4. **Distance Hiked**:
   - The distance hiked can also be calculated using the distance formula:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
     \]
   - Plugging in the values for hiking:
     \[
     \text{Distance hiked} = 20 \text{ miles/hour} \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles}
     \]

5. **Total Distance to Vacation Spot**:
   - The total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:
     \[
     \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance driven} + \text{Distance hiked} = 225 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 255 \text{ miles}

gsm8k,gsm8k-780,SC-3,1,"To determine the difference between Ava's and Emma's scores, we can set up the scoring based on the information provided.

Let:
- \( e \) = number of enemies Emma jumps on
- \( b \) = number of berries Emma collects
- \( t \) = time left on the timer when Emma finishes the level (in seconds)

From the problem, we know:
- Ava jumps on \( e + 8 \) enemies.
- Ava collects \( b + 3 \) berries.
- Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower, so she has \( t - 4 \) seconds left on the timer.

Now, we can calculate the scores for both Ava and Emma.

**Emma's score:**
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Emma}} = 10e + 5b + 30t
\]

**Ava's score:**
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10(e + 8) + 5(b + 3) + 30(t - 4)
\]

Expanding Ava's score:
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10e + 80 + 5b + 15 + 30t - 120
\]
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10e + 5b + 30t - 25
\]

Now, we can find the difference between Ava's and Emma's scores:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} - \text{Score}_{\text{Emma}}
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = (10e + 5b + 30t - 25) - (10e + 5b + 30t)
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = -25
\]

Thus, the difference between Ava's and Emma's scores is \(-25\). This means Ava's score is 25 points lower than Emma's score. 

**Final Answer:**
The difference between their two scores is 25 points, with Emma having the higher score.",0.0009096,18.012483596801758,0,0,gpt-4o-mini,,,1

gsm8k,gsm8k-783,SC-3,1,"Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \( x \) and the number of white fish he bought as \( y \).

Initially, Bob had:
- 3 orange fish
- 4 white fish

After buying the fish, the total number of orange fish becomes \( 3 + x \) and the total number of white fish becomes \( 4 + y \).

According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob found that he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[
3 + x = 2(4 + y)
\]

We also know that Bob bought a total of 17 fish, so:

\[
x + y = 17
\]

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. \( 3 + x = 2(4 + y) \)
2. \( x + y = 17 \)

Let's solve the first equation:

\[
3 + x = 8 + 2y
\]
\[
x - 2y = 5 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]

Now, we can rearrange the second equation:

\[
x = 17 - y \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\]

Now, substitute Equation 2 into Equation 1:

\[
(17 - y) - 2y = 5
\]
\[
17 - 3y = 5
\]
\[
-3y = 5 - 17
\]
\[
-3y = -12
\]
\[
y = 4
\]

Now that we have \( y \), we can find \( x \):

\[
x = 17 - y = 17 - 4 = 13
\]

Thus, Bob bought:
- 13 orange fish
- 4 white fish

Therefore, the number of white fish Bob bought at the store is \( \boxed{4} \).",0.00086385,19.030605792999268,0,0,gpt-4o-mini,,,1

gsm8k,gsm8k-815,SC-3,1,"Let's define the amounts of each ingredient Tanya uses in ounces:

- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest (in ounces).
- Since she uses the same amount of fragrance as citrus zest, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \).
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt (in ounces).
- Since she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \).
- She uses twice as much oil as salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2s \).
- She uses twice as much salt as zest, so \( s = 2z \).

Now, we can express all ingredients in terms of \( z \):

1. Citrus zest: \( z \)
2. Fragrance: \( z \)
3. Salt: \( s = 2z \)
4. Sugar: \( s = 2z \)
5. Oil: \( 2s = 2(2z) = 4z \)

Now, we can set up the equation for the total amount of the scrub:

\[
z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10
\]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[
10z = 10
\]

Now, divide both sides by 10:

\[

Now we can find the amounts of each ingredient:

- Citrus zest: \( z = 1 \) ounce
- Fragrance: \( z = 1 \) ounce
- Salt: \( s = 2z = 2(1) = 2 \) ounces
- Sugar: \( s = 2 \) ounces
- Oil: \( 2s = 4z = 4(1) = 4 \) ounces

Thus, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \( \boxed{4} \) ounces.",0.0007593,28.305465936660767,0,0,gpt-4o-mini,,,1

   \]

2. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, which can be expressed as:
   \[
   b = s + 12
   \]

3. The total number of cards is 341, so we have:

   b + s + p = 341
   \]

Now, substituting \( s \) and \( b \) in terms of \( p \) into the total equation:

\[
(3p + 12) + 3p + p = 341
\]

Combining like terms:

\[
3p + 12 + 3p + p = 341

gsm8k,gsm8k-835,SC-3,1,"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the kangaroos and then use that information to find out how long it will take the turtles to cross the same distance.

1. **Determine the distance traveled by the kangaroos**:
   - We know that 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway. 
   - Let's denote the speed of a kangaroo as \( v \).
   - The distance \( d \) that the kangaroos travel can be calculated as:
     \[
     d = \text{speed} \times \text{time} = v \times 18 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles**:
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of a turtle is:
     \[
     \text{Speed of a turtle} = \frac{v}{2}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time it takes for the turtles to travel the same distance**:
   - The time \( t \) it takes for the turtles to travel the distance \( d \) can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     t = \frac{d}{\text{speed of turtle}} = \frac{d}{\frac{v}{2}} = \frac{d \times 2}{v}

Let's denote:
- \( M \): the number of students good at math.
- \( E \): the number of students good at English.
- \( B \): the number of students good at both subjects.

From the information provided, we can set up the following equations:

- The total number of students can be expressed as:
  \[
  M + E - B = 20
  \]
  where \( M \) includes those good at math only and those good at both subjects, and \( E \) includes those good at English only and those good at both subjects.

From the problem:
- Students good at math only = 5

- Let \( x \) be your age.
- Your brother's age will then be \( x + 3 \) (since you are three years younger than him).
- Your sister's age will be \( x - 2 \) (since you are two years older than her).
- Your mom's age will be \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \) (since her age is one less than three times your brother's age).

Now, we can express the total age of the family:

\[
x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87

Now, let's simplify this equation step by step:

1. Combine the ages:
   \[
   x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) = 3x + 1
   \]
   
2. Calculate your mom's age:
   \[
   3(x + 3) - 1 = 3x + 9 - 1 = 3x + 8
   \]

3. Now, add your age, your brother's age, your sister's age, and your mom's age:
   \[
   3x + 1 + (3x + 8) = 87

1. **Calculate the total selling price of the rope:**
   - The length of the rope is 20 meters.
   - The selling price is $2 per meter.
   - Total selling price = Length of the rope × Price per meter
   \[
   \text{Total selling price} = 20 \, \text{meters} \times 2 \, \text{dollars/meter} = 40 \, \text{dollars}

gsm8k,gsm8k-882,SC-3,1,"To determine how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items in her cart.

1. **Cost of Bacon:**
   - Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total.

2. **Cost of Chicken:**
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Since 5 packs of bacon cost $10, the cost of one pack of bacon is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of one pack of bacon} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Therefore, the cost of one packet of chicken is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of one packet of chicken} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost for chicken is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of chicken} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Cost of Strawberries:**
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, each priced at $4.
   - Therefore, the total cost for strawberries is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of strawberries} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Cost of Apples:**
   - Each pack of apples is priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Since each pack of strawberries costs $4, the cost of one pack of apples is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of one pack of apples} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost for apples is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of apples} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Total Cost of All Items:**

According to the problem:

1. Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as she did Joe's, which means she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.
2. Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's, which means she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.

Now, we can calculate how much Tasha earned from mowing lawns:

- Joe paid Tasha $6 for mowing his lawn \( x \) times, so she earned:
  \[
  \text{Earnings from Joe} = 6
  \]

- If we assume Tasha earned the same amount per mowing for Kamala and Alba, we need to determine how much she earned from them. Let's denote the payment per lawn mowing as \( p \).

- Earnings from Kamala:
  \[
  \text{Earnings from Kamala} = 3x \cdot p
  \]

- Earnings from Alba:
  \[
  \text{Earnings from Alba} = 5x \cdot p
  \]

Now, we can express Tasha's total earnings from mowing lawns as:
\[
\text{Total earnings from mowing} = 6 + 3xp + 5xp = 6 + 8xp
\]

We know that Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[
6 + 8xp + \text{Earnings from lemonade} = 80
\]

Let \( L \) be the earnings from lemonade sales. Thus, we have:
\[
L = 80 - (6 + 8xp)
\]
\[
L = 74 - 8xp
\]

To find \( L \), we need to determine \( xp \). However, we don't have enough information to find the exact values of \( x \) and \( p \). 

But we can analyze the situation further. Since Tasha's total earnings from mowing lawns must be a non-negative number, we can deduce that:
\[
74 - 8xp \geq 0
\]
This implies:
\[
8xp \leq 74
\]
\[
xp \leq \frac{74}{8} = 9.25
\]

This means that the total earnings from mowing lawns (which is \( 8xp + 6 \)) must be less than or equal to $80. 

Since we don't have specific values for \( x \) and \( p \), we cannot determine the exact amount Tasha made from lemonade sales without additional information. However, we can conclude that:

- The total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns is \( 6 + 8xp \).
- The amount she made from lemonade sales is \( L = 74 - 8xp \).

If we assume \( xp \) is small enough such that \( 8xp \) does not exceed 74, we can say that Tasha made a significant amount from lemonade sales. 

In conclusion, without specific values for \( x \) and \( p \), we cannot determine the exact amount Tasha made from lemonade sales, but we know it is \( 74 - 8xp \).",0.00128145,40.18656349182129,0,0,gpt-4o-mini,,,0

Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more miles than Dijana. 

First, we calculate how many miles that is:

1. Calculate \( \frac{1}{5} \) of Dijana's distance:

gsm8k,gsm8k-931,SC-3,1,"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( A \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + A + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   A = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's ages:
   \[
   P = A + J
   \]

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first and third equations.

Substituting \( A = J + 10 \) into the first equation:
\[
P + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
P + 2J + 10 = 100
\]
Subtracting 10 from both sides gives:
\[
P + 2J = 90 \quad \text{(1)}
\]

Now, substituting \( A = J + 10 \) into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
P = 2J + 10 \quad \text{(2)}
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \( P + 2J = 90 \) (from equation 1)
2. \( P = 2J + 10 \) (from equation 2)

We can substitute equation (2) into equation (1):
\[
(2J + 10) + 2J = 90
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
4J + 10 = 90
\]
Subtracting 10 from both sides gives:
\[
4J = 80
\]
Dividing by 4 gives:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now that we have Jean's age, we can find Paul's age:
\[
A = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]

Finally, we can find Peter's age using equation (2):
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the ages are:

- Paul: 30 years
- Peter: 50 years

gsm8k,gsm8k-950,SC-3,1,"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. The total points scored by all three is 45:
   \[
   B + A + D = 45
   \]

2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo:
   \[
   B = A + 20
   \]

3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar:
   \[
   B = D + 10
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( B \) from the second and third equations into the first equation.

Substituting \( B = A + 20 \) into the total points equation:
\[
(A + 20) + A + D = 45
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2A + D + 20 = 45
\]
Subtracting 20 from both sides gives:
\[
2A + D = 25 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]

Next, substituting \( B = D + 10 \) into the total points equation:
\[
(D + 10) + A + D = 45
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
A + 2D + 10 = 45
\]
Subtracting 10 from both sides gives:
\[
A + 2D = 35 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \( 2A + D = 25 \) (Equation 1)
2. \( A + 2D = 35 \) (Equation 2)

We can solve these equations simultaneously. From Equation 1, we can express \( D \) in terms of \( A \):
\[
D = 25 - 2A
\]

Now, substitute \( D \) into Equation 2:
\[
A + 2(25 - 2A) = 35
\]
Expanding this gives:
\[
A + 50 - 4A = 35
\]
Combining like terms results in:
\[
-3A + 50 = 35
\]
Subtracting 50 from both sides gives:
\[
-3A = -15
\]
Dividing by -3 gives:
\[
A = 5
\]

Now that we have \( A \), we can find \( D \) using \( D = 25 - 2A \):
\[
D = 25 - 2(5) = 25 - 10 = 15
\]

Finally, we can find \( B \) using \( B = A + 20 \):
\[
B = 5 + 20 = 25
\]

To summarize:
- Bahati scored \( B = 25 \)
- Azibo scored \( A = 5 \)
- Dinar scored \( D = 15 \)

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the first day:**
   - On the first day, the pirates dug 10 holes.

2. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the second day:**
   - On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
   - Total holes by the end of the second day = 10 (first day) + 13 (second day) = 23 holes.

3. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day before filling in holes:**
   - On the third day, they dug 8 holes.
   - Total holes by the end of the third day = 23 (end of second day) + 8 (third day) = 31 holes.
   - However, they filled in 2 holes, so the total number of holes remaining after filling in is:
     - 31 - 2 = 29 holes.

4. **Determine the number of holes by the end of the fourth day:**
   - According to the problem, by the end of the fourth day, the number of holes was four times the number of holes at the end of the first day.
   - Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, four times that is:
     - 4 * 10 = 40 holes.

5. **Calculate the number of holes dug on the fourth day:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of holes dug on the fourth day.
   - The total number of holes at the end of the fourth day would then be:
     - 29 (holes at the end of the third day) + \( x \) (holes dug on the fourth day) = 40.
   - Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     - 29 + \( x \) = 40.
   - Solving for \( x \):
     - \( x = 40 - 29 = 11 \).

Thus, the pirates dug **11 holes** on the fourth day before finding the treasure.",0.0008482499999999,14.161750555038452,0,0,gpt-4o-mini,,,1

gsm8k,gsm8k-963,SC-3,1,"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe as \( A \), \( S \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following equations:

1. The total number of Pokemon caught:
   \[
   A + S + D = 339
   \]

2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan:
   \[
   A = S + 5
   \]

3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times what Adelwolfe has caught:
   \[
   S = 4D - 13
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( S \) into the first equation.

Substituting \( A \) from equation 2 into equation 1:
\[
(S + 5) + S + D = 339
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2S + D + 5 = 339
\]
Subtracting 5 from both sides gives:
\[
2S + D = 334 \quad \text{(Equation 4)}
\]

Now, we can substitute \( S \) from equation 3 into equation 4. First, we rewrite equation 3:
\[
D = \frac{S + 13}{4}
\]

Now substitute \( D \) into equation 4:
\[
2S + \frac{S + 13}{4} = 334
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 4:
\[
8S + (S + 13) = 1336
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
9S + 13 = 1336
\]
Subtracting 13 from both sides gives:
\[
9S = 1323
\]
Dividing by 9:
\[
S = 147
\]

Now that we have \( S \), we can find \( A \) and \( D \).

Using \( S = 147 \) in equation 2:
\[
A = S + 5 = 147 + 5 = 152
\]

Using \( S = 147 \) in equation 3 to find \( D \):
\[
147 = 4D - 13
\]
Adding 13 to both sides:
\[
160 = 4D
\]
Dividing by 4:
\[
D = 40
\]

Now we have:
- \( A = 152 \)
- \( S = 147 \)
- \( D = 40 \)

Finally, we can verify:
\[
A + S + D = 152 + 147 + 40 = 339
\]

Thus, the number of Pokemon Stan has caught is:

gsm8k,gsm8k-979,SC-3,1,"Let's denote Emil's current age as \( E = 19 \).

When Emil turns 24, he will be \( 24 - 19 = 5 \) years older. Therefore, in 5 years, Emil's age will be \( 24 \).

Let \( D \) be the current age of Emil's dad and \( B \) be the current age of Emil's brother.

According to the problem, when Emil is 24:
- He will be half the age of his dad:
  \[
  24 = \frac{1}{2}(D + 5)
  \]
  This can be rearranged to:
  \[
  48 = D + 5 \implies D = 48 - 5 = 43
  \]

- He will be twice as old as his brother:
  \[
  24 = 2(B + 5)
  \]
  This can be rearranged to:
  \[
  24 = 2B + 10 \implies 2B = 24 - 10 = 14 \implies B = 7
  \]

Now we have the current ages:
- Emil's dad's current age \( D = 43 \)
- Emil's brother's current age \( B = 7 \)

Since Halley's Comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we can determine the timeline of events:

1. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
2. The next time the comet appeared, Bill's dad would be \( 30 + 75 = 105 \) years old.
3. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet the first time.

Now, we need to express Bill's age when he saw the comet the second time:

   Each of the 100 guests brought 15 cookies. Therefore, the total number of cookies is:
   \[
   \text{Total cookies} = 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies}

gsm8k,gsm8k-999,SC-3,1,"To solve the problem, we need to determine how to divide the watermelon among the 2 adults and 4 kids while adhering to the condition that each adult's slice is twice as big as each kid's slice.

Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since there are 4 kids, the total size of the slices for the kids is:

\[
4x
\]

Each adult gets a slice that is twice the size of a kid's slice, which means each adult gets:

\[
2x
\]

Since there are 2 adults, the total size of the slices for the adults is:

\[
2 \times 2x = 4x
\]

Now, we can find the total size of the watermelon by adding the total sizes of the slices for both adults and kids:

\[
\text{Total size} = \text{Total size for adults} + \text{Total size for kids} = 4x + 4x = 8x
\]

Next, we want to find out what percentage of the watermelon each adult gets. The size of each adult's slice is \( 2x \), and the total size of the watermelon is \( 8x \). The percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Percentage for each adult} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of each adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Percentage for each adult} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\%

gsm8k,gsm8k-1015,SC-3,1,"First, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of sweets in the box. Since there are 15 packs and each pack contains 60 pieces, we can find the total number of pieces as follows:

\[
\text{Total pieces} = \text{Number of packs} \times \text{Pieces per pack} = 15 \times 60 = 900
\]

Next, Anne kept 2 packs for herself. We need to find out how many packs she gave away:

\[
\text{Packs given away} = \text{Total packs} - \text{Packs kept} = 15 - 2 = 13
\]

Now, we can calculate the total number of pieces in the 13 packs that were given away:

\[
\text{Pieces given away} = \text{Packs given away} \times \text{Pieces per pack} = 13 \times 60 = 780
\]

Anne distributed these 780 pieces equally among her 10 friends. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide the total pieces given away by the number of friends:

\[

\[
P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n
\]

Where:
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price,
- \( r \) is the rate of increase (as a decimal),
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) (initial price),
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% increase),
- \( n = 3 \) (number of years).

Now, substituting the values into the formula:

\[
P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3

gsm8k,gsm8k-1017,SC-3,1,"To find out how many selfies and portraits Olivia had, we can start by determining how many pictures she put in each album.

Since Olivia uploaded 72 pictures and put them into 8 albums, we can calculate the number of pictures in each album:

\[
\text{Number of pictures per album} = \frac{72 \text{ pictures}}{8 \text{ albums}} = 9 \text{ pictures per album}
\]

Next, we know that 3 of the albums were selfies only and 2 of the albums were portraits. Since each album contains 9 pictures, we can calculate the total number of selfies and portraits:

1. **Selfies:**
   \[
   \text{Total selfies} = 3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 27 \text{ selfies}
   \]

2. **Portraits:**
   \[
   \text{Total portraits} = 2 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 18 \text{ portraits}
   \]

Now, we can check how many pictures are left for the remaining albums. There are 3 albums accounted for (selfies) and 2 albums (portraits), which totals 5 albums. This leaves us with:

\[
8 \text{ total albums} - 5 \text{ accounted albums} = 3 \text{ albums remaining}
\]

These remaining 3 albums must contain pictures that are neither selfies nor portraits. Since each of these albums also contains 9 pictures, we can calculate the total number of pictures in these albums:

According to the problem:

1. Each small stuffed animal costs $4.
2. The price of a large stuffed animal is three times that of a small one, so it costs \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.
3. Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, which gives us the equation:
   \[
   S = 2L
   \]
4. The total earnings from the sales is $120. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   4S + 12L = 120

1. **Substitute Teacher (50% chance)**:
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework. 
   - Probability of not turning in homework = 50% (0.5).

2. **Normal Teacher (50% chance)**:
   - If the normal teacher is present, there are two sub-scenarios:
     - **Extension Given (40% chance)**: If the teacher gives an extension, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.
       - Probability of not turning in homework = 40% (0.4).
     - **No Extension (60% chance)**: If the teacher does not give an extension, Marcus has a chance to convince her that his dog ate his homework.
       - Probability of this happening = 20% (0.2).
       - If he convinces her, he does not have to turn in his homework.
       - Therefore, if the teacher does not give an extension, the probability that he still does not have to turn in homework is:
         - Probability of convincing the teacher = 20% (0.2).
         - Probability of not turning in homework in this case = 60% (0.6) * 20% (0.2) = 12% (0.12).
       - Thus, the probability that he has to turn in homework if the teacher does not give an extension is:
         - Probability of no extension (60%) * Probability of not convincing (80%) = 60% * 80% = 48% (0.48).

Now, we can summarize the probabilities:

- **Substitute Teacher**: 50% chance of not turning in homework.
- **Normal Teacher**:
  - Extension Given: 40% chance of not turning in homework.
  - No Extension: 12% chance of not turning in homework (from convincing the teacher).
  - Total probability of not turning in homework with the normal teacher = 40% + 12% = 52% (0.52).

Now we combine these probabilities:

- Probability of not turning in homework with a substitute teacher = 0.5.

gsm8k,gsm8k-1038,SC-3,1,"To determine how long it would take Jim to earn back the money equivalent to the loans and the income lost while he was in college, we can break the problem down into several steps.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Loans
Jim takes out $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years:
\[
\text{Total Loans} = 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Income Lost While in College
Before college, Jim had a job that paid $25,000 per year. For 4 years, the income he would have earned is:
\[
\text{Income Lost} = 25,000 \times 4 = 100,000
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Total Cost
Now, we add the total loans and the income lost:
\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Total Loans} + \text{Income Lost} = 200,000 + 100,000 = 300,000

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took \( 2(x + 80) \).

Now, we can set up the equation based on the total amount shared:

\[
x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920
\]

Now, let's simplify the left side of the equation:

\[
x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920
\]

Combining like terms:

\[
4x + 240 = 1920
\]

Next, we will isolate \( x \) by subtracting 240 from both sides:

\[
4x = 1920 - 240

\[
4x = 1680

Now, divide both sides by 4:

\[

Thus, the share of the first person is \( \boxed{420} \). 

To verify:
- The first person gets \( 420 \).
- The second person gets \( 420 + 80 = 500 \).
- The third person gets \( 2 \times 500 = 1000 \).

Now, adding these amounts together:

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls (four more than in the second set).
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls (half as many as in the second set).

The total number of tennis balls retrieved in all three sets is given as 19. We can set up the following equation based on this information:

\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Now, let's simplify the equation step by step:

1. Combine like terms:
   \[
   2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
   \]

2. To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 2:
   \[
   2(2x + 4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2 \cdot 19
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   4x + 8 + x = 38
   \]

3. Combine the \( x \) terms:
   \[
   5x + 8 = 38
   \]

4. Subtract 8 from both sides:
   \[
   5x = 30

5. Divide by 5:

1. **Calculate the total number of sheets washed per week:**
   - Greg has 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed.
   - Each twin bed has 1 set of sheets, so for 4 twin beds, he has 4 twin sets.
   - The king size bed has 1 set of sheets.
   - Total sheets per week = 4 (twin) + 1 (king) = 5 sets of sheets.

2. **Determine the number of loads required per week:**
   - The laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time.
   - For the 4 twin sets, he will need:
     - 4 twin sets ÷ 2 sets/load = 2 loads for twin sheets.
   - The laundry machine can wash 1 king set at a time, so he will need:
     - 1 load for the king sheet.
   - Total loads per week = 2 (twin loads) + 1 (king load) = 3 loads.

3. **Calculate the total number of loads in a year:**

1. **Total Slices of Pizza**: 
   Each pizza has 8 slices, and there are 4 pizzas. 
   \[
   \text{Total slices} = 4 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices/pizza} = 32 \text{ slices}
   \]

2. **Becky's Slices**: 
   It is given that Becky ate 10 slices.

3. **Jake's Slices**: 
   We know that Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake. Therefore, if we let \( J \) represent the number of slices Jake ate, we have:

The total time taken to make the meal is the sum of both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
x + (x + 18) = 98
\]

Now, simplify the equation:

   - Jenny bought 15 roses.
   - The cost of one rose is $2.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 15 roses is:
     \[
     15 \text{ roses} \times 2 \text{ dollars/rose} = 30 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Initial Money**:
   - Jenny arrived with five $5 bills.
   - The total amount of money she had is:
     \[
     5 \text{ bills} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bill} = 25 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculating Change**:
   - Jenny needs to pay $30 for the roses but only has $25.
   - This means she does not have enough money to pay for the roses. In fact, she is short:
     \[
     30 \text{ dollars} - 25 \text{ dollars} = 5 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Since Jenny cannot complete the purchase of the roses due to insufficient funds, she does not buy any roses and leaves the florist with the same amount of money she arrived with.

4. **Quarters**:
   - Since she has $25 and the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert her $25 into quarters.
   - The value of one quarter is $0.25. Therefore, the number of quarters she has is:
     \[
     \frac{25 \text{ dollars}}{0.25 \text{ dollars/quarter}} = 100 \text{ quarters}
     \]

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrival: 10 minutes
   - Departure: 10 minutes + 20 minutes = 30 minutes

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrival: The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves.
   - First train leaves at 30 minutes, so the second train arrives at 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 60 minutes.
   - The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed (20 minutes).
   - Departure: 60 minutes + 5 minutes = 65 minutes

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrival: The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves.
   - Second train leaves at 65 minutes, so the third train arrives at 65 minutes + 60 minutes = 125 minutes.
   - The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so it departs at 125 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrival: The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - Third train leaves at 125 minutes, so the fourth train arrives at 125 minutes + 20 minutes = 145 minutes.

Since the total amount of fence is 100 feet, we can set up the following equation:

\[
S + H = 100
\]

Substituting \( H \) with \( S + 60 \):

\[
S + (S + 60) = 100

1. **Amalia's time**: 
   - Amalia mowed the lawn, which took her 4 hours.

2. **Megan's time**: 
   - Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia. 
   - Therefore, Megan's time = Amalia's time + 2 hours = 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours.

3. **Dior's time**: 
   - Dior took well over 4 hours longer than Amalia. 
   - Since Amalia took 4 hours, Dior's time = Amalia's time + 4 hours + some additional time (let's denote this additional time as \( x \)).
   - Therefore, Dior's time = 4 hours + 4 hours + \( x \) = 8 hours + \( x \).

Since the problem states that Dior took ""well over"" 4 hours longer than Amalia, we can assume \( x \) is at least 1 hour (but we don't have a specific value for \( x \)). For the sake of calculation, let's assume \( x = 1 \) hour, which gives us:

Now, Grandma's speed on the sidewalk is twice her speed on the beach:

\[
\text{Speed on sidewalk} = 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles/minute}
\]

Next, we calculate the time spent walking on the sidewalk. She walks 1 mile on the sidewalk, so the time spent on the sidewalk is:

\[
\text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{\text{Distance on sidewalk}}{\text{Speed on sidewalk}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles/minute}} = 1 \times 10 = 10 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we can find the total time for the entire 3-mile walk by adding the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time on beach} + \text{Time on sidewalk} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time it takes Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk is:

gsm8k,gsm8k-1137,SC-3,1,"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water, we can set up an equation based on the concept of mixing temperatures.

Let \( T \) be the temperature of the second mug. 

1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - Mug 1 (33 degrees): 4 ounces poured into the bottle.
   - Mug 2 (unknown temperature \( T \)): 1 ounce poured into the bottle.

2. **Final Temperature**:
   After pouring the water into the bottle, Donny can drink the water, which means the final temperature must be at least 40 degrees.

3. **Calculating the Final Temperature**:
   The final temperature \( T_f \) of the mixture can be calculated using the formula for the weighted average of the temperatures:

   \[
   T_f = \frac{(T_1 \cdot V_1) + (T_2 \cdot V_2)}{V_1 + V_2}
   \]

   Where:
   - \( T_1 = 33 \) degrees (temperature of mug 1)
   - \( V_1 = 4 \) ounces (volume from mug 1)
   - \( T_2 = T \) (temperature of mug 2)
   - \( V_2 = 1 \) ounce (volume from mug 2)

   Plugging in the values:

   \[
   T_f = \frac{(33 \cdot 4) + (T \cdot 1)}{4 + 1}
   \]

   Simplifying this gives:

   \[
   T_f = \frac{132 + T}{5}
   \]

4. **Setting up the inequality**:
   Since Donny can drink the water, we set the final temperature \( T_f \) to be at least 40 degrees:

   \[
   \frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
   \]

5. **Solving the inequality**:
   Multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction:

   \[
   132 + T \geq 200
   \]

   Subtract 132 from both sides:

   \[
   T \geq 68

Thus, the minimum temperature of the second mug of water must be at least **68 degrees** for Donny to be able to drink the water.",0.0008677499999999,18.94246816635132,0,0,gpt-4o-mini,,,1

According to the problem:

1. Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. Therefore, we can express Carlos's collection as:
   \[
   \text{Carlos's seashells} = 27 - 5 = 22
   \]

2. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey:
   \[
   \text{Carlos's seashells} = 2C

   Since we found Carlos collected 22 seashells, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   2C = 22

   Solving for \( C \):
   \[
   C = \frac{22}{2} = 11

Now we have the number of seashells collected by each person:
- Carrey collected \( C = 11 \) seashells.
- Carlos collected 22 seashells.
- Jim collected 27 seashells.

Next, we calculate the total number of seashells collected:

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope:
   \[
   r = 4b

2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope:
   \[
   b = y - 7
   \]

3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters:
   \[
   r + b + y = 37

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( r \) and \( b \) into the combined length equation.

Substituting \( r = 4b \) into the combined length equation:
\[
4b + b + y = 37
\]
This simplifies to:
\[

\]

Next, we substitute \( b = y - 7 \) into the equation \( 5b + y = 37 \):
\[
5(y - 7) + y = 37

Expanding this gives:

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now:
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7)
   \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now:
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
   \]

Now we can solve these equations step by step.

### Step 1: Expand the first equation
From the first equation:
\[
W = 5(C + 7) = 5C + 35
\]

### Step 2: Substitute \( W \) in the second equation
Now substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35)
\]

### Step 3: Clear the fraction
Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5C + 35
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

### Step 4: Rearrange the equation
Now, rearranging the equation gives:
\[
75 - 35 = 5C - 3C
\]
\[
40 = 2C
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( C \)
Dividing both sides by 2:
\[
C = 20
\]

### Conclusion
Colin's current age is \( \boxed{20} \).

### Verification
1. If Colin is 20 now, in 7 years he will be \( 20 + 7 = 27 \).
   Then Wendy's age will be \( W = 5 \times 27 = 135 \).

2. In 25 years, Colin will be \( 20 + 25 = 45 \).

2. **Medium setting**: Removes twice as much as the low setting, which is \(2 \times 1 = 2\) liters per day.
3. **High setting**: Removes twice as much as the medium setting, which is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) liters per day.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of water removed for each setting over the specified number of days:

- **Low setting for 3 days**:
  \[
  \text{Water removed} = 1 \text{ liter/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3 \text{ liters}
  \]

- **Medium setting for 3 days**:
  \[

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar**:
   The jar has a square base with dimensions 6 inches by 6 inches and a height of 15 inches.

   \[
   \text{Volume of the jar} = \text{Base Area} \times \text{Height} = (6 \, \text{inches} \times 6 \, \text{inches}) \times 15 \, \text{inches} = 36 \, \text{inches}^2 \times 15 \, \text{inches} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches}

2. **Number of Robots**: The problem states that there are half as many robots as helmets. Therefore, the number of robots can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Number of Robots} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of Helmets} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
   \]

3. **Number of Footballs**: The problem also states that there are half as many helmets as footballs. This means that the number of footballs can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Number of Footballs} = 2 \times \text{Number of Helmets} = 2 \times 20 = 40

gsm8k,gsm8k-1256,SC-3,1,"To determine how long it will take Phineas Frog to return home, we first need to calculate the distance he will travel on land and in water.

The total distance from his current location back to his home is 200 yards. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, we can calculate:

- Distance on land = \( \frac{200}{2} = 100 \) yards
- Distance in water = \( \frac{200}{2} = 100 \) yards

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to travel each segment:

1. **Time to hop on land:**
   - Speed on land = 20 yards per minute
   - Time on land = \( \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards/minute}} = 5 \) minutes

2. **Time to swim in water:**
   - Speed in water = 10 yards per minute
   - Time in water = \( \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards/minute}} = 10 \) minutes

Finally, we add the time spent on land and in water to find the total time:

\[

\text{Total candies accounted} = \text{Red} + \text{Orange} + \text{Yellow} = 54 + 108 + 27
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
54 + 108 = 162
\]
\[
162 + 27 = 189
\]

Now, we know that the total number of candies in the bag is 232. To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total accounted candies from the total candies in the bag:

\[
\text{Pink candies} = \text{Total candies} - \text{Total candies accounted}
\]
\[
\text{Pink candies} = 232 - 189 = 43

1. **Cost of the Hotel:**
   - Helen booked the hotel for 3 nights.
   - The cost per night at the hotel is $80.
   - Total cost for the hotel = Number of nights × Cost per night
   \[
   \text{Total hotel cost} = 3 \text{ nights} \times 80 \text{ dollars/night} = 240 \text{ dollars}

2. **Distance run by Vanessa**:
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles.

3. **Time taken by Aaron**:
   - Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. 
   - We can calculate the distance Aaron ran using his speed:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
     \]
   - Since Aaron's speed is \( 2v \) and he ran for 16 minutes, the distance he ran is:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_{\text{Aaron}} = 2v \times 16 = 32v
     \]

4. **Distance relationship**:
   - The problem states that Vanessa can run twice as far as Aaron. Therefore, if Aaron ran \( d \) miles, Vanessa ran \( 2d \) miles.
   - From the previous calculation, we know that Vanessa ran 4 miles, so we set up the equation:
     \[
     4 = 2d \implies d = 2
     \]
   - This means Aaron ran 2 miles.

5. **Finding Aaron's speed**:
   - We can now find Aaron's speed using the distance he ran:
     \[
     \text{Speed}_{\text{Aaron}} = \frac{\text{Distance}_{\text{Aaron}}}{\text{Time}_{\text{Aaron}}} = \frac{2}{16} = \frac{1}{8} \text{ miles per minute}

gsm8k,gsm8k-1313,SC-3,1,"To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the watermelons**: The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80.

2. **Calculate the total selling price with a profit of 25%**:
   - First, we need to find the profit amount. A profit of 25% on the cost price means:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = \text{Cost Price} \times \frac{25}{100} = 80 \times 0.25 = 20
     \]
   - Now, we add the profit to the cost price to find the total selling price:
     \[
     \text{Total Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} + \text{Profit} = 80 + 20 = 100
     \]

3. **Calculate the selling price per watermelon**:
   - To find the selling price per watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
     \[
     \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{\text{Total Selling Price}}{\text{Number of Watermelons}} = \frac{100}{50} = 2
     \]

Thus, each watermelon was sold for **$2**.",0.0005283,9.547849893569946,0,0,gpt-4o-mini,,,1
gsm8k,gsm8k-1314,SC-3,1,"Let's break down the information given step by step:

1. **Dora's Age**: Dora will turn 12 in 3 years. This means she is currently:
   \[
   12 - 3 = 9 \text{ years old}
   \]

2. **James's Age**: We know that James is currently twice as old as Dora. Therefore, James's current age is:
   \[
   2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **John's Age**: John had James when he was 19. Since James is currently 18, we can determine John's current age:
   \[
   19 + 18 = 37 \text{ years old}
   \]

4. **John's Youngest Son**: John had his youngest son when he was 32. Since John is currently 37, the age of his youngest son is:
   \[
   37 - 32 = 5 \text{ years old}
   \]

5. **Youngest Son's Age in 3 Years**: To find out how old John's youngest son will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
   \[
   5 + 3 = 8 \text{ years old}
   \]

Therefore, John's youngest son will be **8 years old in 3 years**.",0.0005559,19.861973524093628,0,0,gpt-4o-mini,,,0
gsm8k,gsm8k-1315,SC-3,1,"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we first need to calculate how many oranges each of them can peel in that time.

1. **Calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour:**
   - Ana takes 3 minutes to peel one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - The number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour is:
     \[
     \text{Number of oranges peeled by Ana} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour:**
   - Jane takes 4 minutes to peel one orange.
   - The number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour is:
     \[
     \text{Number of oranges peeled by Jane} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges}
     \]

3. **Calculate the difference in the number of oranges peeled:**
   - The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Oranges peeled by Ana} - \text{Oranges peeled by Jane} = 20 - 15 = 5

gsm8k,gsm8k-1317,SC-3,1,"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( c \) and the number of cows as \( w \).

We have two equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of animals:
   \[
   c + w = 20
   \]

2. The total number of legs:
   Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, so:
   \[
   2c + 4w = 70
   \]

Now, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[
c + 2w = 35
\]

Now we have a system of equations:
1. \( c + w = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2w = 35 \)

Next, we can solve this system. We can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(c + 2w) - (c + w) = 35 - 20
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
w = 15
\]

Now that we have the number of cows, we can substitute \( w \) back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[
c + 15 = 20
\]
\[
c = 20 - 15 = 5
\]

Thus, the number of chickens is \( \boxed{5} \).",0.0006217499999999,11.256550312042236,0,0,gpt-4o-mini,,,1
