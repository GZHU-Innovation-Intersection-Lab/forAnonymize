gsm8k,gsm8k-200,TrustRoute-NoParallel,3,"To find out how many liters of water Baldur gets every day, we can break it down into two parts: the water he collects in the morning and the water he collects in the afternoon.

1. **Morning collection**:
   - Baldur collects 5 pails of water in the morning.
   - Each pail contains 5 liters of water.
   - Therefore, the total amount of water collected in the morning is:
     \[
     5 \text{ pails} \times 5 \text{ liters/pail} = 25 \text{ liters}
     \]

2. **Afternoon collection**:
   - Baldur collects 6 pails of water in the afternoon.
   - Each pail also contains 5 liters of water.
   - Therefore, the total amount of water collected in the afternoon is:
     \[
     6 \text{ pails} \times 5 \text{ liters/pail} = 30 \text{ liters}
     \]

3. **Total daily collection**:

1. **Sandwiches**:
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch for 7 days.
   - Each sandwich used 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese used for sandwiches = 7 days × 2 slices/day = 14 slices.

2. **Omelets**:
   - Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast for 3 days.
   - Each omelet used one more slice of cheese than the sandwiches. Since each sandwich uses 2 slices, each omelet uses 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

gsm8k,gsm8k-205,TrustRoute-NoParallel,3,"To find out what score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after dropping the lowest score, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total score needed for an average of 93 after dropping the lowest score.**  
   Since there are six tests, and the lowest score will be dropped, we will calculate the average based on the remaining five tests. To find the total score needed for an average of 93, we can use the formula:

   \[
   \text{Total needed} = \text{Average} \times \text{Number of tests after dropping} = 93 \times 5 = 465
   \]

2. **Calculate the sum of the first five test scores.**  
   Brinley's scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. We need to find the sum of these scores:

   \[
   \text{Sum of scores} = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438
   \]

3. **Determine the score needed on the sixth test.**  
   Let \( x \) be the score Brinley needs on her sixth test. After dropping the lowest score, the sum of the remaining scores should equal 465. The lowest score among her first five tests is 71, so we will drop that score. The equation becomes:

   \[
   438 + x - 71 = 465
   \]

   Simplifying this gives:

   \[
   438 + x - 71 = 465 \\

gsm8k,gsm8k-207,TrustRoute-NoParallel,3,"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately, and then sum them.

1. **Weight of Chocolate Bars:**
   - Number of chocolate bars = 25
   - Weight of each chocolate bar = 40g
   - Total weight of chocolate bars = Number of chocolate bars × Weight of each chocolate bar
   \[
   \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{g}
   \]

2. **Weight of Candied Apples:**
   - Number of candied apples = 80
   - Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, we can find the weight of each candied apple:
     - Weight of each candied apple = Weight of each chocolate bar / 2 = 40g / 2 = 20g
   - Total weight of candied apples = Number of candied apples × Weight of each candied apple

1. **Calculate the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Half a dozen plates means \(6 / 2 = 3\) plates.
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 3 plates is:
     \[
     3 \text{ plates} \times 6000 \text{ dollars/plate} = 18000 \text{ dollars}

gsm8k,gsm8k-210,TrustRoute-NoParallel,3,"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

1. **Cost of the jacket**: $30
2. **Cost of 2 pairs of shoes**: 2 pairs × $20/pair = $40

Now, we can find the total cost:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of jacket} + \text{Cost of shoes} = 30 + 40 = 70
\]

Next, we calculate how much money Sara has after babysitting and before mowing the lawn.

1. **Earnings from babysitting**: She babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings from babysitting} = 4 \times 5 = 20
   \]

2. **Total money Sara has before mowing the lawn**:
   \[
   \text{Total money} = \text{Saved money} + \text{Earnings from babysitting} = 10 + 20 = 30

Now, we find out how much more money she needs to reach the total cost of $70:

\[
\text{Additional money needed} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Total money} = 70 - 30 = 40
\]

Next, we calculate how much Sara earns from mowing the lawn. She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. Let \( x \) be the number of times she needs to mow the lawn. The equation for the money she earns from mowing is:

\[

gsm8k,gsm8k-211,TrustRoute-NoParallel,3,"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, so the total egg production from red chickens is \( 3r \).
2. The white chickens produce 5 eggs a day, so the total egg production from white chickens is \( 5w \).
3. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs each day, which gives us the equation:
   \[
   3r + 5w = 42
   \]
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which gives us the equation:
   \[
   w = r + 2
   \]

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation. Replacing \( w \) in the first equation, we get:
\[
3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
\]

Now, let's simplify this equation:
\[
3r + 5r + 10 = 42
\]
\[
8r + 10 = 42
\]

Next, we subtract 10 from both sides:
\[
8r = 32
\]

Now, divide both sides by 8:
\[
r = 4
\]

So, Jerry has \( \boxed{4} \) red chickens.

To find the number of white chickens, we can use the equation \( w = r + 2 \):
\[
w = 4 + 2 = 6
\]

Thus, Jerry has 4 red chickens and 6 white chickens. We can verify the total egg production:
- Red chickens produce: \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) eggs
- White chickens produce: \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \) eggs
- Total: \( 12 + 30 = 42 \) eggs, which matches the problem statement.

Both pools leak water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. In 4 minutes, each pool will lose:

\[
\text{Water lost by each pool} = 4 \text{ gallons/minute} \times 4 \text{ minutes} = 16 \text{ gallons}

Now, we can express the current amounts of water in each pool:

- The small pool now has:
\[

- Naomi: \( N = 68 \)
- Yuri: \( Y \)
- Brianna: \( B \)
- Jojo: \( J \)

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi:
   \[
   Y = \frac{N}{2} + 10
   \]
   Substituting \( N = 68 \):
   \[
   Y = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]

2. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi:
   \[
   B = N + 17
   \]
   Substituting \( N = 68 \):
   \[
   B = 68 + 17 = 85

Now we can find the total points scored by all four students:
\[
N + Y + B + J = 251

gsm8k,gsm8k-242,TrustRoute-NoParallel,3,"To determine how many hours Mike spends writing letters each week, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of pen pals Mike has now:**
   - Initially, Mike had 5 pen pals.
   - He stopped being pen pals with 2 of them.
   - Therefore, the number of pen pals he has now is:
     \[
     5 - 2 = 3
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of letters he receives each week:**
   - Each pen pal sends 2 letters a week.
   - With 3 pen pals, the total number of letters he receives is:
     \[
     3 \text{ pen pals} \times 2 \text{ letters/pen pal} = 6 \text{ letters}
     \]

3. **Determine the total number of pages he reads each week:**
   - Each letter is 5 pages long.
   - Therefore, the total number of pages from the letters is:
     \[
     6 \text{ letters} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 30 \text{ pages}
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of pages he writes in response:**
   - Mike responds in kind, meaning he writes the same number of pages as he receives.
   - Thus, he writes 30 pages in response.

5. **Determine how long it takes him to write those pages:**
   - Mike can write 1 page every 6 minutes.
   - Therefore, the time it takes him to write 30 pages is:
     \[
     30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes}
     \]

6. **Convert the total writing time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
     \[
     \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
   \[
   R = 6S
   \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
   \[
   R + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation.

Substituting \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
\]

Now, let's simplify the right side:
\[
6S + 9 = 3S + 27
\]

Next, we will isolate \( S \) by moving all terms involving \( S \) to one side and constant terms to the other side:
\[
6S - 3S = 27 - 9
\]
\[
3S = 18

Now, divide both sides by 3:

S = 6

So, Sam is currently \( 6 \) years old.

To find Ruby's age, we can substitute \( S \) back into the equation for \( R \):

R = 6S = 6 \times 6 = 36

Thus, Ruby is \( 36 \) years old.

To verify, in 9 years:
- Sam will be \( 6 + 9 = 15 \)
- Ruby will be \( 36 + 9 = 45 \)

And indeed, \( 45 \) is \( 3 \times 15 \).

1. **Determine the number of spots on a mamba**: 
   Since a cobra has 70 spots and it has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can find the number of spots on a mamba by dividing the number of spots on a cobra by 2:
   \[
   \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of spots for all cobras**:
   There are 40 cobras, and each cobra has 70 spots. Therefore, the total number of spots for all cobras is:
   \[
   \text{Total spots for cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of spots for all mambas**:
   There are 60 mambas, and each mamba has 35 spots. Therefore, the total number of spots for all mambas is:
   \[
   \text{Total spots for mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100
   \]

4. **Calculate the combined total number of spots**:
   Now, we can add the total spots for cobras and mambas:
   \[
   \text{Combined total spots} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900
   \]

5. **Find half of the combined total number of spots**:
   Finally, we need to find half of the combined total number of spots:

1. **Understanding the Layout**: Each piece of paper, when folded, creates 4 pages. This is because:
   - When you fold a piece of paper in half, you get two sides.
   - Each side has a front and a back, resulting in 4 pages total.

2. **Calculating the Number of Papers**: Since each piece of paper provides 4 pages, we can calculate the number of pieces of paper needed for 32 pages by dividing the total number of pages by the number of pages per piece of paper:
   \[
   \text{Number of pieces of paper} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Pages per paper}} = \frac{32}{4} = 8

1. **Determine the number of books sold this year:**
   - This year, Elise sold 45 books.

2. **Determine the number of books sold in the first year:**
   - According to the problem, she sold twice as many books in the first year as she sold this year. Therefore, in the first year, she sold:
     \[
     \text{Books sold in the first year} = 2 \times 45 = 90 \text{ books}
     \]

3. **Determine the total number of books sold over the three years:**
   - The total number of books Elise has is 250, and there are currently 50 unsold books. Thus, the total number of books sold over the three years is:
     \[
     \text{Total books sold} = 250 - 50 = 200 \text{ books}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of books sold in the second year:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of books sold in the second year. We know:
     \[
     \text{Books sold in the first year} + \text{Books sold in the second year} + \text{Books sold this year} = 200
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     90 + x + 45 = 200

   - So, Elise sold 65 books in the second year.

5. **Calculate the total earnings from the second year:**
   - Each book sells for $20, so the total amount of money earned in the second year is:
     \[
     \text{Earnings} = \text{Books sold in the second year} \times \text{Price per book} = 65 \times 20 = 1300

   - Total cost for suits = 6 suits * $100/suit = $600.

2. **Cost of Suitcases:**
   - Theo buys 3 suitcases at $50 each.
   - Total cost for suitcases = 3 suitcases * $50/suitcase = $150.

3. **Cost of Flight Ticket:**
   - The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit.
   - Cost of a business suit = $100.
   - 5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500.

- Cera's current age \( C = 46 \).
- Six years ago, Cera's age was \( C - 6 = 46 - 6 = 40 \).
- Six years ago, Noah's age was \( N - 6 \).
- At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera, so we have the equation:
  \[
  N - 6 = \frac{1}{2}(C - 6)
  \]
  Substituting \( C = 46 \):
  \[
  N - 6 = \frac{1}{2}(40)
  \]
  \[
  N - 6 = 20
  \]
  \[
  N = 26
  \]

Now, we have Noah's current age \( N = 26 \) and Cera's current age \( C = 46 \).

Next, we need to find the population of Chile six years ago. The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah at that time:
\[
\text{Population six years ago} = 3000 \times (N - 6) = 3000 \times 20 = 60000

Now, we need to find the current population of Chile. The problem states that six years ago, the population was half of what it is now:
\[
\text{Population six years ago} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Current Population}
\]
Let \( P \) be the current population. Then:
\[
60000 = \frac{1}{2} P

Multiplying both sides by 2 gives:
\[
P = 120000

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is \( 2d \) (twice as many as on defense).
- The number of players on special teams is \( \frac{d}{2} \) (half the number of players on defense).

The total number of members in the team is given as 105. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
d + 2d + \frac{d}{2} = 105
\]

Now, let's simplify the left side of the equation:

\[
d + 2d = 3d
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
3d + \frac{d}{2} = 105
\]

To combine the terms, we can express \( 3d \) in terms of a fraction with a common denominator:

\[
3d = \frac{6d}{2}
\]

Now, substituting this back into the equation gives:

\[
\frac{6d}{2} + \frac{d}{2} = 105
\]

Combining the fractions:

\[
\frac{6d + d}{2} = 105
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{7d}{2} = 105
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 2:

\[
7d = 210
\]

Now, divide both sides by 7:

\[
d = 30

Thus, the number of players on the defense is \( \boxed{30} \). 

To verify:
- Offense: \( 2d = 2 \times 30 = 60 \)

   - Number of people who left = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \) people.

3. **Calculate the number of people remaining:**
   - Total remaining = Initial total - Number of people who left
   - Total remaining = 40 - 10 = 30 people.

4. **Determine how many men stayed:**
   - We know that 22 men stayed at the party.

5. **Calculate the number of women remaining:**
   - Total remaining people = 30
   - Number of men remaining = 22
   - Therefore, the number of women remaining = Total remaining - Number of men remaining
   - Number of women remaining = 30 - 22 = 8 women.

1. **Cost of the Book**: The book costs $4.

2. **Cost of the Magazine**: The magazine costs half as much as the book. Therefore:
   \[
   \text{Cost of the Magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of the Book} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2

   So, the magazine costs $2.

3. **Cost of the Pen**: The pen costs $1 less than the magazine. Therefore:
   \[

gsm8k,gsm8k-322,TrustRoute-NoParallel,3,"First, let's determine how many pencils Jam has. We know that Jam has three boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, totaling 26 pencils. 

Let \( x \) be the number of pencils in each box. Then, we can express the total number of pencils Jam has as:

\[
3x + 2 = 26
\]

To find \( x \), we can first subtract 2 from both sides:

\[
3x = 26 - 2
\]
\[
3x = 24
\]

Now, divide both sides by 3:

\[
x = \frac{24}{3} = 8
\]

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Therefore, Jam has:

- 3 boxes of 8 pencils: \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \) pencils
- 2 loose pencils: \( 2 \) pencils

Total pencils Jam has: \( 24 + 2 = 26 \) pencils (which confirms our calculation).

Now, let's find out how many pencils Meg has. We know she has 46 pencils.

Now, we can calculate the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together:

\[
\text{Total pencils} = \text{Jam's pencils} + \text{Meg's pencils} = 26 + 46 = 72
\]

Next, we need to determine how many boxes are needed to store 72 pencils. Assuming each box can hold 8 pencils (the same as Jam's boxes), we can calculate the number of boxes required:

\[
\text{Number of boxes} = \frac{\text{Total pencils}}{\text{Pencils per box}} = \frac{72}{8} = 9
\]

Thus, Jam and Meg need a total of **9 boxes** to store all their pencils.",0.00024539999999999995,7.344998598098755,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage1_only,

1. **Cooling Effect of Ice Cubes**:
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - To find out how many ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we can use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{\text{Total cooling needed}}{\text{Cooling per ice cube}} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]

2. **Weakening Effect of Ice Cubes**:
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - Therefore, the total weakening from the 5 ice cubes is:
     \[
     \text{Total weakening from ice cubes} = 5 \text{ cubes} \times 12 \text{ ml/cube} = 60 \text{ ml}
     \]

3. **Weakening Effect of Cream**:
   - Adding 15 milliliters of cream also weakens the coffee. We assume that adding cream does not have a specific weakening effect mentioned, so we will just consider the volume added.
   - The cream itself does not weaken the coffee further, but it adds to the total volume of the drink.

4. **Total Weakening Calculation**:
   - The total weakening of the iced coffee is solely from the ice cubes since the cream does not contribute to weakening:
     \[
     \text{Total weakening} = 60 \text{ ml (from ice cubes)}
     \]

Thus, Shannon's iced coffee is **60 milliliters weaker** after cooling it by 65 degrees and adding 15 milliliters of cream.",0.00025949999999999997,6.536115884780884,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage1_only,

- The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is given as \( 4x - 5 \).
- The number of customers kicked out for physical violence is \( 3 \) times the number of shoplifters.

Now, we can calculate the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting:

\[
\text{Shoplifters} = 4x - 5 = 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7
\]

Next, we calculate the number of customers kicked out for physical violence:

\[
\text{Physical violence} = 3 \times \text{Shoplifters} = 3 \times 7 = 21

- **Anna's silver pesos**: Since Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, she has:
  \[
  2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ silver pesos}
  \]

- **Anna's gold pesos**: Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has:
  \[
  80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos}
  \]

Now we can calculate the total number of pesos for both Axel and Anna:

- **Total pesos for Axel**:
  \[
  50 \text{ (silver)} + 80 \text{ (gold)} = 130 \text{ pesos}
  \]

- **Total pesos for Anna**:
  \[
  100 \text{ (silver)} + 120 \text{ (gold)} = 220 \text{ pesos}
  \]

Finally, we add their totals together to find the total number of pesos they have together:
\[
130 + 220 = 350 \text{ pesos}
\]

Thus, the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together is **350 pesos**.",0.00019124999999999996,5.183221817016602,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage1_only,

1. **Determine the cost of the jogger jeans**: 
   The tattered jeans cost $28, and the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of jogger jeans} = 28 - 6 = 22 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of both jeans**:
   The total cost of both jeans is:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of tattered jeans} + \text{Cost of jogger jeans} = 28 + 22 = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Understanding the savings**:
   Cole saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. 

   Let \( S_j \) be the savings from the jogger jeans and \( S_t \) be the savings from the tattered jeans. According to the problem:
   \[
   S_j + S_t = 6
   \]
   and
   \[
   S_j = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Thus, the savings from the tattered jeans is:
   \[
   S_t = 6 - S_j = 6 - 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Determine the original prices of the jeans**:
   Since he saved $2 on the jogger jeans, the original price of the jogger jeans before the discount was:
   \[
   \text{Original price of jogger jeans} = 22 + 2 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   The original price of the tattered jeans was:
   \[
   \text{Original price of tattered jeans} = 28 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the difference in original prices**:
   Now, we need to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Original price of jogger jeans} - \text{Original price of tattered jeans} = 24 - 28 = -4
   \]

Since the result is negative, it indicates that the jogger jeans originally cost $4 less than the tattered jeans.

Thus, the jogger jeans originally cost **$4 less** than the tattered jeans.",0.00035355,11.655319213867188,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage1_only,

1. **Initial Preparation**: The caterer prepared enough hot dogs for half of the guests to have two hot dogs each. Since there were originally 36 guests, half of that is:
   \[
   \frac{36}{2} = 18 \text{ guests}
   \]
   If these 18 guests each have 2 hot dogs, the total number of hot dogs prepared is:
   \[
   18 \times 2 = 36 \text{ hot dogs}

2. **Guests Who Showed Up**: However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hot dog. This means that all 40 guests would want 2 hot dogs each, which totals:
   \[
   40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ hot dogs}
   \]

3. **Hot Dogs Available vs. Hot Dogs Needed**: The caterer only prepared 36 hot dogs, but 80 hot dogs are needed. To find out how many guests did not get a second hot dog, we need to determine how many guests can be served with the 36 hot dogs.

   Each guest can have at most 1 hot dog initially, and then we can see how many can get a second hot dog with the remaining hot dogs.

   - First, all 40 guests can get 1 hot dog each, which uses up 40 hot dogs. Since only 36 hot dogs are available, not everyone can get a first hot dog. 
   - Therefore, we can serve 36 guests with 1 hot dog each.

4. **Calculating Guests Who Did Not Get a Second Hot Dog**: Since 36 guests can get 1 hot dog, that leaves:
   \[
   40 - 36 = 4 \text{ guests who did not get a hot dog at all.}
   \]
   Since all 36 guests who received a hot dog would want a second one, and there are no hot dogs left for the remaining 4 guests, those 4 guests did not get a second hot dog.

4. **Buy one get one free offer**: 
   - Since Heather buys 2 packs, she effectively pays for 1 pack and gets 1 pack free.
   - Therefore, she only pays for 1 pack:
   \[
   \text{Cost after BOGO} = 4.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Applying the coupon**: 
   - Heather has a $2.00 coupon.
   - So, the total cost after applying the coupon is:

Substituting the expressions for Lily and David in terms of \( D \) and \( B \):

     - Cost: $6
     - Number of sticks: 400

2. **Cost per stick**:
   - For 2 x 4:
     \[
     \text{Cost per stick} = \frac{4}{200} = 0.02 \text{ dollars per stick}
     \]
   - For 2 x 8:
     \[
     \text{Cost per stick} = \frac{6}{400} = 0.015 \text{ dollars per stick}
     \]

Since the 2 x 8 piece of wood provides a cheaper cost per stick, Frederick should prioritize buying 2 x 8 pieces of wood.

3. **Maximizing the number of sticks**:
   - Let's see how many 2 x 8 pieces he can buy with $24:
     \[
     \text{Number of 2 x 8 pieces} = \frac{24}{6} = 4
     \]
   - If he buys 4 pieces of 2 x 8:
     \[
     \text{Total sticks from 4 pieces} = 4 \times 400 = 1600 \text{ sticks}
     \]

4. **Verification**:
   - Cost for 4 pieces of 2 x 8:
     \[
     4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - This uses the entire budget of $24.

Thus, the maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make by buying the cheapest lumber is **1600 sticks**.",0.00026849999999999997,7.999873399734497,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage1_only,

1. **Farm:**
   - Cows: 30
   - Sheep: Since the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, we first need to find the number of sheep at the zoo.

2. **Zoo:**
   - Sheep: 20
   - Cows: The problem states that the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm. Since the farm has 30 cows, the zoo has:
     \[
     \text{Cows at zoo} = 2 \times 30 = 60
     \]

Now we can summarize the number of animals:

- **Farm:**
  - Cows: 30
  - Sheep: Since the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, we have:
    \[
    \text{Sheep at farm} = \frac{20}{2} = 10

- **Zoo:**
  - Cows: 60
  - Sheep: 20

Now we can calculate the total number of animals:

- Total animals on the farm:
  \[
  30 \text{ (cows)} + 10 \text{ (sheep)} = 40
  \]

- Total animals at the zoo:
  \[
  60 \text{ (cows)} + 20 \text{ (sheep)} = 80
  \]

According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought. We know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Therefore, we can set up the following equations:

1. The total number of onions Rose bought is 4 times the number of onions Sophia bought:
   \[
   12 = 4x
   \]

2. The total number of potatoes Rose bought is 4 times the number of potatoes Sophia bought:

1. **Calculate the number of rows for red tulips:**
   - Jackson can fit 6 red tulips in a row.
   - He has 36 red tulips.
   - The number of rows of red tulips is calculated by dividing the total number of red tulips by the number of tulips per row:
     \[
     \text{Number of rows of red tulips} = \frac{36 \text{ red tulips}}{6 \text{ tulips per row}} = 6 \text{ rows}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of rows for blue tulips:**
   - Jackson can fit 8 blue tulips in a row.

According to the problem:

1. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs:
   \[
   S_O = C_O - 2
   \]
   where \( S_O \) is the number of sofas Ophelia has.

2. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia:
   \[
   C_J = 3C_O
   \]

3. Ophelia has 20 sofas:
   \[
   S_O = 20
   \]

From the first equation, we can substitute \( S_O \) into the equation for chairs:
\[
20 = C_O - 2
\]
Solving for \( C_O \):
\[
C_O = 20 + 2 = 22
\]

Now, we can find the number of chairs Jenna has using the second equation:
\[
C_J = 3C_O = 3 \times 22 = 66
\]

Next, we can find the number of sofas Jenna has. Since she also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs:
\[
S_J = C_J - 2 = 66 - 2 = 64
\]

Now we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:
- Total sofas:
  \[
  S_O + S_J = 20 + 64 = 84

- Total chairs:
  \[
  C_O + C_J = 22 + 66 = 88

According to the problem:
- The number of red jelly beans is \( r = b - 0.01b = 0.99b \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( g = b + 0.01b = 1.01b \).

The total number of jelly beans in the jar is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
r + b + g = 4500
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( r \) and \( g \):

\[
0.99b + b + 1.01b = 4500
\]

Combining the terms:

\[
(0.99 + 1 + 1.01)b = 4500
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
3.01b = 4500
\]

Now, we can solve for \( b \):

\[
b = \frac{4500}{3.01} \approx 1498.34
\]

Since the number of jelly beans must be a whole number, we will round \( b \) to the nearest whole number, which is 1498. 

Now we can find \( r \) and \( g \):

\[
r = 0.99b = 0.99 \times 1498 \approx 1483.02 \quad \text{(rounding gives } 1483\text{)}

1. The initial height of the beanstalk is 4 feet.
2. The beanstalk doubles in height every day.
3. Mark's window is 20 feet off the ground.

We need to find the smallest integer \( n \) such that the height of the beanstalk after \( n \) days is greater than 20 feet.

The height of the beanstalk after \( n \) days can be expressed as:

\[

- \( 2^1 = 2 \)
- \( 2^2 = 4 \)
- \( 2^3 = 8 \)

Since \( 2^3 = 8 \) is the first power of 2 that is greater than 5, we find that \( n = 3 \) is the smallest integer satisfying the inequality.

- Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.

Calculating the total number of cups sold in the first 4 hours:
\[
\text{Total cups in 4 hours} = 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ cups}
\]

Calculating the total earnings from these cups:
\[
\text{Earnings from 4 hours} = 60 \text{ cups} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/cup} = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Part 2: Earnings from the next 2 hours**
- Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.

Calculating the total number of cups sold in the next 2 hours:
\[
\text{Total cups in 2 hours} = 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ cups}
\]

Calculating the total earnings from these cups:
\[
\text{Earnings from 2 hours} = 20 \text{ cups} \times 0.60 \text{ dollars/cup} = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Total Earnings**
Now, we can add the earnings from both parts to find the total earnings:
\[
\text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings from 4 hours} + \text{Earnings from 2 hours} = 30 \text{ dollars} + 12 \text{ dollars} = 42 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, Patrick earned a total of **$42** from selling lemonade for 6 hours.",0.00026939999999999993,6.449076890945435,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage1_only,
gsm8k,gsm8k-606,TrustRoute-NoParallel,3,"To determine how many years it will take before the tire needs to be replaced, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of rotations the tires undergo in a month:**
   - The car drives 400 miles a month.
   - The tires rotate 725 times for every 2 miles.
   - First, we find out how many 2-mile segments are in 400 miles:
     \[
     \text{Number of 2-mile segments} = \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/segment}} = 200 \text{ segments}
     \]
   - Now, we calculate the total rotations in a month:
     \[
     \text{Total rotations in a month} = 200 \text{ segments} \times 725 \text{ rotations/segment} = 145,000 \text{ rotations}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of rotations in a year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year, so:
     \[
     \text{Total rotations in a year} = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}
     \]

3. **Determine how many years the tires can last before needing replacement:**
   - Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations.
   - To find out how many years it will take to reach this limit, we divide the total rotations by the yearly rotations:
     \[
     \text{Years before replacement} = \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} \approx 6 \text{ years}
     \]

gsm8k,gsm8k-607,TrustRoute-NoParallel,3,"To find out how much each pump of shampoo costs in cents when Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of washes Jackie can get from the jumbo bottle**:
   - The directions say that 2 pumps provide 120 washes.
   - Therefore, 1 pump will provide half of that: 
     \[
     \text{Washes per pump} = \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{2} = 60 \text{ washes}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost per wash**:
   - The total cost of the jumbo bottle is $24.00.
   - To find the cost per wash, we divide the total cost by the number of washes:
     \[
     \text{Cost per wash} = \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washes}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per wash}
     \]

3. **Calculate the cost per pump**:
   - Since Jackie uses 1 pump per wash and each wash costs $0.20, the cost per pump is also $0.20.

4. **Convert the cost per pump to cents**:
   - Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, we convert $0.20 to cents:
     \[
     \text{Cost per pump in cents} = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ cents}

gsm8k,gsm8k-611,TrustRoute-NoParallel,3,"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we can break it down into two parts: the initial funding for the first 5 months and the funding for the additional months.

1. **Initial Funding for the First 5 Months:**
   - Initial funding = $100,000
   - Duration = 5 months
   - Total cost for the first 5 months = $100,000

2. **Duration of Research:**
   - Total duration of research = 10 times the initial duration of 5 months = 10 * 5 = 50 months

3. **Additional Months:**
   - Additional months = Total duration - Initial duration = 50 months - 5 months = 45 months

4. **Funding for the Additional Months:**
   - The funding for each of the additional months increases by 50% each month after the first 5 months.
   - The funding for the 6th month = 50% more than the funding for the 5th month.
   - Since the funding for the first 5 months is $100,000, we can assume that the monthly funding for the first 5 months is:
     \[
     \text{Monthly funding} = \frac{100,000}{5} = 20,000
     \]

   - Now, we can calculate the funding for each of the additional months:
     - 6th month: \( 20,000 \times 1.5 = 30,000 \)
     - 7th month: \( 30,000 \times 1.5 = 45,000 \)
     - 8th month: \( 45,000 \times 1.5 = 67,500 \)
     - 9th month: \( 67,500 \times 1.5 = 101,250 \)
     - 10th month: \( 101,250 \times 1.5 = 151,875 \)
     - Continuing this pattern, we can see that the funding for each month can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Funding for month } n = 20,000 \times (1.5)^{(n-5)}
     \]
     for \( n = 6, 7, \ldots, 50 \).

5. **Total Cost for Additional Months:**
   - We need to sum the funding from the 6th month to the 50th month:
   \[
   \text{Total cost for additional months} = \sum_{n=6}^{50} 20,000 \times (1.5)^{(n-5)}
   \]
   - This is a geometric series where:
     - First term \( a = 30,000 \) (for the 6th month)
     - Common ratio \( r = 1.5 \)
     - Number of terms \( n = 45 \)

   The sum of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S_n = a \frac{(1 - r^n)}{1 - r}
   \]
   where \( n \) is the number of terms.

   - Here, \( a = 30,000 \), \( r = 1.5 \), and \( n = 45 \):
   \[
   S_{45} = 30,000 \frac{(1 - (1.5)^{45})}{1 - 1.5}
   \]
   \[
   S_{45} = 30,000 \frac{(1 - (1.5)^{45})}{-0.5}
   \]
   \[
   S_{45} = -60,000 (1 - (1.5)^{45})
   \]

   Now, we can calculate \( (1.5)^{45} \) using a calculator:
   \[
   (1.5)^{45} \approx 11222.741
   \]
   Thus,
   \[
   S_{45} \approx -60,000 (1 - 11222.741) \approx -60,000 \times -11221.741 \approx 673,304,460
   \]

6. **Total Cost of Research:**
   - Total cost = Cost for the first 5 months + Cost for additional months
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 100,000 + 673,304,460 \approx 673,404,460

1. **Total Cost of Classes**: Manny's total cost for the Karate classes is $60.
2. **Maximum Cost per Class**: His parents will not sign him up again if the cost exceeds $10 per class.

Given that there are 10 total classes, we can calculate the maximum total cost allowed for the classes:

\[
\text{Maximum Total Cost} = \text{Maximum Cost per Class} \times \text{Total Classes} = 10 \times 10 = 100
\]

However, since Manny's total cost is $60, we need to find out how many classes he can miss while keeping the average cost per class at or below $10.

Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny misses. Therefore, the number of classes he attends is \( 10 - x \).

The cost per class based on the number of classes attended is:

\[
\text{Cost per Class} = \frac{\text{Total Cost}}{\text{Number of Classes Attended}} = \frac{60}{10 - x}
\]

We need this cost to be less than or equal to $10:

\[
\frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10
\]

Now, we can solve this inequality:

1. Multiply both sides by \( 10 - x \) (noting that \( 10 - x > 0 \) since he can't miss all classes):

\[
60 \leq 10(10 - x)
\]

2. Distributing the right side:

\[
60 \leq 100 - 10x
\]

3. Rearranging the inequality:

\[
10x \leq 100 - 60
\]
\[
10x \leq 40
\]
\[
x \leq 4
\]

Thus, Manny can miss up to 4 classes. If he misses 4 classes, he will attend 6 classes, and the cost per class will be:

\[
\frac{60}{6} = 10
\]

If he misses more than 4 classes (i.e., 5 or more), the cost per class will exceed $10.

Therefore, Manny can miss **up to 4 classes** before his parents decide not to sign him up again.",0.00032819999999999995,7.962254762649536,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage1_only,

1. **Cost of the suits:**
   - Number of suits = 10
   - Cost per suit = $750
   - Total cost for suits = 10 suits × $750/suit = $7,500

2. **Cost of the dress pants:**
   - Number of dress pants = 10
   - Cost per dress pant = 1/5 of the cost of a suit = $750 / 5 = $150
   - Total cost for dress pants = 10 pants × $150/pant = $1,500

3. **Cost of the dress shirts:**
   - Number of dress shirts = 3 shirts per suit × 10 suits = 30 shirts
   - Cost per dress shirt = $60
   - Total cost for dress shirts = 30 shirts × $60/shirt = $1,800

Let:

- \( g \) = number of geese

We know the following:
1. Each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs. The total number of legs is 70.
2. Each animal has 1 head. The total number of heads is 20.

From this information, we can create the following equations:

1. For the total number of legs:
   \[
   4s + 2g = 70
   \]

2. For the total number of heads:
   \[
   s + g = 20

Now we can solve this system of equations.

First, we can solve the second equation for \( g \):
\[
g = 20 - s
\]

Next, we substitute \( g \) in the first equation:

\[

   - Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 12 toys for 12 dogs.

3. **Toys James Has**: 
   - James currently has 4 toys.

4. **Toys James Needs to Buy Initially**: 
   - Toys needed = 12 (total dogs) - 4 (toys he has) = 8 toys.
   - So, James buys 8 more toys.

5. **After Buying Toys**: 
   - James now has 4 (initial) + 8 (bought) = 12 toys.

6. **Situation When He Returns**: 
   - He sees that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left.

1. There is one set of twins, so we can denote the ages of the twins as \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \). Let's assume \( T_1 = T \) and \( T_2 = T \) (both twins are the same age).
2. There is one set of triplets, so we can denote their ages as \( R_1, R_2, R_3 \) (all triplets are the same age).
3. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet. We can express this as:
   \[
   T = R + 7
   \]
   where \( R \) is the age of one of the triplets.
4. The combined ages of the twins and triplets is 44:
   \[
   T_1 + T_2 + R_1 + R_2 + R_3 = 44

   Since \( T_1 = T_2 = T \) and \( R_1 = R_2 = R_3 = R \), we can rewrite this as:

Now we have two equations:
1. \( T = R + 7 \)
2. \( 2T + 3R = 44 \)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation. Substituting \( T \) gives us:

Now, substituting the values of \( G \) and \( R \) into the total capacity equation:

\[
4000 + 4800 + Y = 11600
\]

Now, combine the known values:

\[
8800 + Y = 11600
\]

Next, isolate \( Y \) by subtracting 8800 from both sides:

\[
Y = 11600 - 8800
\]
\[
Y = 2800
\]

Thus, Gary's truck can carry **2,800 pounds** of gravel.",0.0001647,5.1393163204193115,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage1_only,

We know that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. Given that the cat runs at a speed of 15 feet/second, we can set up the following equation to find the turtle's speed:

Let \( t \) be the speed of the turtle in feet/second.

Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we have:
\[
15 = 5t
\]

Now, we can solve for \( t \):
\[
t = \frac{15}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second}

1. **Total number of pizzas**: Bryce and his four friends ordered a total of 5 pizzas.

2. **Total number of slices**: Each pizza has 12 slices, so the total number of slices is:
   \[
   5 \text{ pizzas} \times 12 \text{ slices/pizza} = 60 \text{ slices}
   \]

3. **Slices eaten by Bryce and two friends**: Bryce and two of his friends ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizzas. Since there are 3 people, the total amount of pizza they ate is:
   \[
   3 \text{ pizzas} \times \frac{2}{3} = 2 \text{ pizzas}
   \]
   The number of slices they ate is:
   \[
   2 \text{ pizzas} \times 12 \text{ slices/pizza} = 24 \text{ slices}
   \]

4. **Slices eaten by the two remaining friends**: The two remaining friends ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizzas. Since there are 2 people, the total amount of pizza they ate is:
   \[
   2 \text{ pizzas} \times \frac{3}{4} = 1.5 \text{ pizzas}
   \]
   The number of slices they ate is:
   \[
   1.5 \text{ pizzas} \times 12 \text{ slices/pizza} = 18 \text{ slices}
   \]

5. **Total slices eaten**: Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by adding the slices eaten by both groups:
   \[
   24 \text{ slices} + 18 \text{ slices} = 42 \text{ slices}
   \]

6. **Slices left**: Finally, we subtract the total slices eaten from the total slices available:

Topher's shoe length is 8 feet and 4 inches. We convert this to inches:

1. Convert feet to inches:
   \[
   8 \text{ feet} = 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. Add the remaining inches:
   \[
   96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches}

2. **Science books**: Let's assume Cindy has \( s \) science books. Each science book also weighs 2 pounds, so the total weight of the science books is \( 2s \) pounds.

3. **French book**: The French book weighs 4 pounds.

4. **English book**: The English book weighs 3 pounds.

5. **History book**: The history book weighs twice as much as the English book. Since the English book weighs 3 pounds, the history book weighs \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total weight of all the books:

\[

2. **Trading Small Stickers**:
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = \( 0.9 \times 30 = 27 \) small stickers.
   - She trades these 27 small stickers for large buttons. Since each small sticker is worth 1 small button, she can trade 27 small stickers for 27 small buttons.
   - Each large button is worth 3 small buttons, so:

4. **Trading Large Stickers**:
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = \( 0.5 \times 40 = 20 \) large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth 1 large button, so she trades 20 large stickers for 20 large buttons.

5. **Remaining Large Stickers**:

3x + 2x = 250
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
5x = 250
\]
Now, solve for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{250}{5} = 50
\]

Now that we have \( x \), we can find \( y \) and \( z \):
\[
y = 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100
\]
\[
z = 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100

From the problem, we know:
- Ava jumps on \( E + 8 \) enemies.
- Ava collects \( B + 3 \) berries.
- Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower, so she has \( T - 4 \) seconds left.

\]

Now, substitute Equation 2 into Equation 1:

\[
(17 - y) - 2y = 5
\]
\[
17 - 3y = 5
\]
\[
-3y = 5 - 17
\]
\[
-3y = -12
\]
\[
y = 4
\]

Now that we have \( y \), we can find \( x \) using Equation 2:

\[
x = 17 - y = 17 - 4 = 13
\]

Thus, Bob bought:
- \( x = 13 \) orange fish
- \( y = 4 \) white fish

Therefore, the number of white fish Bob bought at the store is \( \boxed{4} \).",0.00028995,6.502566576004028,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage1_only,

   - DeSean also makes 9 S'mores, which uses another 9 marshmallows.
   - Total marshmallows used for S'mores = 9 (John) + 9 (DeSean) = 18 marshmallows.

2. **Account for the marshmallows dropped:**
   - They dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground.

3. **Calculate the total marshmallows used and dropped:**

1. **Jack's Playtime:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter.

2. **Two Friends' Playtime:**
   - Each of the two friends who are worse than Jack can play for half as long as Jack.
   - Therefore, each of them can play for \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) minutes with 1 quarter.

3. **One Friend's Playtime:**
   - The friend who is better than Jack can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack.
   - Therefore, this friend can play for \( 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \) minutes with 1 quarter.

Now, let's summarize the playtime for each person:
- Jack: 20 minutes
- Friend 1: 10 minutes
- Friend 2: 10 minutes
- Friend 3: 30 minutes

Next, we calculate the total playtime for all four players:
- Total playtime = Jack's time + Friend 1's time + Friend 2's time + Friend 3's time
- Total playtime = 20 + 10 + 10 + 30 = 70 minutes

Now, they play for a total of 4 hours, which is:
- Total playtime in minutes = 4 hours × 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes

Next, we need to determine how many quarters are needed for the total playtime of 240 minutes:
1. **Total playtime per quarter:**
   - Jack: 20 minutes/quarter
   - Friend 1: 10 minutes/quarter
   - Friend 2: 10 minutes/quarter
   - Friend 3: 30 minutes/quarter

2. **Total playtime per quarter for all four players:**
   - Total playtime per quarter = 20 + 10 + 10 + 30 = 70 minutes

3. **Number of quarters needed for 240 minutes:**
   - Number of quarters = Total playtime / Total playtime per quarter
   - Number of quarters = 240 minutes / 70 minutes/quarter ≈ 3.43 quarters

Since they cannot use a fraction of a quarter, they will need to round up to the nearest whole number, which means they will need 4 quarters.

Finally, we calculate the total money used:
- Each quarter costs $0.25.
- Total money used = Number of quarters × Cost per quarter
- Total money used = 4 quarters × $0.25/quarter = $1.00

Thus, the total amount of money used is **$1.00**.",0.00037814999999999995,9.01240611076355,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage1_only,

- Salt = \( S \)
- Sugar = \( S \) (since she uses the same amount of salt as sugar)
- Fragrance = \( F \)
- Citrus Zest = \( F \) (since she uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance)
- Oil = \( O \)

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. \( O = 2S \) (twice as much oil as salt)
2. \( S = 2F \) (twice as much salt as zest)

Since the total amount of the scrub is 10 ounces, we can write the equation:

\[
S + S + F + F + O = 10
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2S + 2F + O = 10
\]

Now, substituting \( O \) and \( F \) in terms of \( S \):

1. From \( O = 2S \), we can substitute \( O \) in the total equation:
   \[
   2S + 2F + 2S = 10
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   4S + 2F = 10
   \]

2. From \( S = 2F \), we can express \( F \) in terms of \( S \):
   \[
   F = \frac{S}{2}
   \]

Now substitute \( F \) into the equation \( 4S + 2F = 10 \):

\[
4S + 2\left(\frac{S}{2}\right) = 10
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
4S + S = 10

\[
5S = 10
\]

Now, solving for \( S \):

\[
S = 2

Now that we have \( S \), we can find \( O \):

1. Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so we can express Smendrick's cards as:
   \[
   s = 3p
   \]

2. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so we can express Becca's cards as:
   \[
   b = s + 12 = 3p + 12
   \]

3. The total number of cards is 341, which gives us the equation:
   \[
   b + s + p = 341
   \]

Now, substituting the expressions for \( b \) and \( s \) into the total equation:
\[
(3p + 12) + (3p) + p = 341
\]

Combining like terms:
\[
3p + 12 + 3p + p = 341
\]
\[
7p + 12 = 341
\]

Next, we subtract 12 from both sides:
\[
7p = 341 - 12
\]
\[
7p = 329
\]

Now, divide both sides by 7 to find \( p \):
\[
p = \frac{329}{7} = 47

Now that we have \( p \), we can find \( s \) and \( b \):
\[
s = 3p = 3 \times 47 = 141

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos**:
   - We know that 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway. 
   - The total time taken by the kangaroos does not depend on the number of kangaroos since they are traveling together. Thus, we can say that the time taken to cross the highway is 18 hours.

2. **Calculate the distance**:
   - Let \( D \) be the distance across the highway.
   - If we assume the speed of each kangaroo is \( v \), then the distance can be calculated as:
     \[
     D = v \times \text{time}

   - Since there are 3 kangaroos, we can consider their combined effort, but for distance, we just need the speed of one kangaroo:
     \[
     D = v \times 18
     \]

3. **Determine the speed of the turtles**:
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle is:
     \[
     \text{Speed of turtle} = \frac{v}{2}
     \]

4. **Calculate the time for the turtles to cross the highway**:
   - The time taken by the turtles to cross the same distance \( D \) can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{D}{\text{Speed}}
     \]
   - Substituting the distance and the speed of the turtles:
     \[
     \text{Time for turtles} = \frac{D}{\frac{v}{2}} = \frac{D \times 2}{v}

5. **Substituting for \( D \)**:

- Money from part-time job: $150
- Money from mom: $80

Total money from job and mom:

   - According to the problem, \( 2S_J = 60 \).
   - Therefore, \( S_J = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) socks.

2. **Determine Peter's socks:**
   - Peter has twice as many socks as Jack.

1. There are 20 students in total.
2. 5 students are good at math only.
3. 8 students are good at English only.

Let's denote:
- \( M \) as the number of students good at math.
- \( E \) as the number of students good at English.
- \( B \) as the number of students good at both subjects.

From the information provided, we can set up the following equations:

- The total number of students is given by:

\[
A = P + I
\]

where:
- \( A \) is the total amount after interest,
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial investment),
- \( I \) is the interest earned.

The interest \( I \) can be calculated using the formula:

\[
I = P \times r \times t
\]

where:
- \( r \) is the interest rate (as a decimal),
- \( t \) is the time in years.

Given:
- \( P = 300 \) dollars,
- The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year, which means \( r = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75 \),
- \( t = 3 \) years.

- Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age, so her age will be \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \).

Now, we can express the total of all ages:

We are given the following information:

1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (the total number of books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the first equation.

From equation 3, we can express \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
\[
A = F - 12
\]

Now, substitute \( A \) into equation 2 to find \( S \):
\[
S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13
\]

Now we have expressions for \( S \) and \( A \):
- \( S = F + 13 \)
- \( A = F - 12 \)

Substituting these into the total books equation:

1. **Calculate the total selling price of the rope:**
   - The length of the rope is 20 meters.
   - The price per meter is $2.
   - Total selling price = Length of rope × Price per meter = 20 meters × $2/meter = $40.

2. **Determine how much new rope Sarah can buy:**
   - The cost of the new rope is $1.5 per meter.
   - To find out how many meters of new rope she can buy with the $40, we divide the total money by the cost per meter:
   - Number of meters of new rope = Total money / Cost per meter = $40 / $1.5 ≈ 26.67 meters.

3. **Calculate the total cost of the new rope:**
   - Since she can buy approximately 26.67 meters, we calculate the total cost:
   - Total cost of new rope = Number of meters × Cost per meter = 26.67 meters × $1.5/meter = $40.

4. **Calculate the leftover money:**

1. **Cost of bacon**: 
   - Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total.

2. **Cost of chicken**:
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. Since the total cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10, the cost of one pack of bacon is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of one pack of bacon} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Therefore, the cost of one packet of chicken is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of one packet of chicken} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost for chicken is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of chicken} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Cost of strawberries**:
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, each priced at $4. Thus, the total cost for strawberries is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of strawberries} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Cost of apples**:
   - Each pack of apples is priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries. Since a pack of strawberries costs $4, the cost of one pack of apples is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of one pack of apples} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost for apples is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of apples} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Total cost of all items**:
   - Now, we can sum up the costs of all items:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of bacon} + \text{Cost of chicken} + \text{Cost of strawberries} + \text{Cost of apples}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 10 + 24 + 12 + 14 = 60 \text{ dollars}
     \]

6. **Calculating remaining budget**:
   - Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from her budget:
     \[
     \text{Remaining budget} = 65 - 60 = 5 \text{ dollars}

- Four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \).

According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago:
\[
D - 8 = 2 \times (A - 4)

gsm8k,gsm8k-912,TrustRoute-NoParallel,3,"To determine how many bottles of water John drinks while solving both a normal sudoku puzzle and an extreme sudoku puzzle, we first need to calculate the time it takes for each type of puzzle.

1. **Normal Sudoku**: 
   - Time taken = 45 minutes.

2. **Extreme Sudoku**: 
   - Time taken = 4 times the time of a normal sudoku.
   - Time taken = 4 × 45 minutes = 180 minutes.

1. **Calculate the calories for mini cinnamon rolls:**
   - A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
   - A mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll:
     \[
     \text{Calories in a mini cinnamon roll} = \frac{600}{3} = 200 \text{ calories}
     \]
   - Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls is:
     \[
     \text{Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls} = 200 \times 200 = 40,000 \text{ calories}
     \]

2. **Calculate the calories for mini blueberry muffins:**
   - A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
   - A mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin:
     \[
     \text{Calories in a mini blueberry muffin} = \frac{450}{3} = 150 \text{ calories}

1. **Monday**: Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
2. **Tuesday**: She removed twice as many as Monday, so:
   \[
   2 \times 39 = 78 \text{ Junebugs}
   \]
3. **Wednesday**: She removed the same amount as Tuesday, so:
   \[
   78 \text{ Junebugs}
   \]
4. **Thursday**: She removed 48 Junebugs.
5. **Friday**: She removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, we can calculate the total number of Junebugs removed from Monday to Friday:
\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:
- \(39 + 78 = 117\)
- \(117 + 78 = 195\)
- \(195 + 48 = 243\)
- \(243 + 57 = 300\)

So, the total number of Junebugs removed is 300.

Next, we find the average by dividing the total by the number of days (5 days):

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + A + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   A = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = A + J
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( P \) into the first equation.

First, substitute \( A \) from equation 2 into equation 3:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now substitute \( P \) and \( A \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Now, solve for \( J \):
\[
4J = 100 - 20
\]
\[
4J = 80
\]
\[
J = 20
\]

Now that we have \( J \), we can find \( A \) (Paul's age):
\[
A = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30

Finally, we can find \( P \) (Peter's age):
\[
P = A + J = 30 + 20 = 50

gsm8k,gsm8k-944,TrustRoute-NoParallel,3,"To calculate how much Jen will earn from selling her root crops, we need to find the total earnings from each type of crop and then sum them up.

1. **Yams**: 
   - Number of yams = 6
   - Price per yam = $1.5
   - Total from yams = 6 yams * $1.5/yam = $9.00

2. **Sweet Potatoes**: 
   - Number of sweet potatoes = 10

gsm8k,gsm8k-945,TrustRoute-NoParallel,3,"To determine how long it took James to swim across the lake, we can break the problem down into several steps.

1. **Calculate the distance he swims initially:**
   James swims 60% of the total distance of the lake, which is 20 miles.
   \[
   \text{Distance swum} = 0.6 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to swim the first part:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour. The time taken to swim 12 miles can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the resting time:**
   He rests for half as long as the swimming time. Therefore, the resting time is:
   \[
   \text{Resting time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   After swimming 12 miles, the remaining distance to swim is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the speed for the remaining distance:**
   He swims the remaining distance at half his original speed:
   \[
   \text{New speed} = \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour}
   \]

6. **Calculate the time taken to swim the remaining distance:**
   The time taken to swim the remaining 8 miles is:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total time taken:**
   The total time taken to cross the lake is the sum of the swimming time for the first part, the resting time, and the swimming time for the second part:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}

1. The total points scored by all three is 45:
   \[
   B + A + D = 45
   \]

2. Bahati scored 20 points more than Azibo:
   \[
   B = A + 20
   \]

3. Bahati scored 10 points more than Dinar:
   \[
   B = D + 10
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( B \) from the second and third equations into the first equation.

From the second equation, we can express \( A \) in terms of \( B \):
\[
A = B - 20
\]

From the third equation, we can express \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
\[
D = B - 10
\]

Now substitute \( A \) and \( D \) into the total points equation:
\[
B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45
\]

Combine the terms:
\[
B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45

gsm8k,gsm8k-963,TrustRoute-NoParallel,3,"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe as \( A \), \( S \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following equations:

1. The total number of Pokemon caught:
   \[
   A + S + D = 339
   \]

2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan:
   \[
   A = S + 5
   \]

3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times what Adelwolfe has caught:
   \[
   S = 4D - 13
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( S \) into the first equation.

Substituting \( A \) into the total equation:
\[
(S + 5) + S + D = 339
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2S + D + 5 = 339
\]
Subtracting 5 from both sides gives:
\[
2S + D = 334 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]

Next, we substitute \( S \) from the third equation into Equation 1:
\[
2(4D - 13) + D = 334
\]
Expanding this gives:
\[
8D - 26 + D = 334
\]
Combining like terms results in:
\[
9D - 26 = 334
\]
Adding 26 to both sides:
\[
9D = 360
\]
Dividing by 9:
\[
D = 40
\]

Now that we have \( D \), we can find \( S \):
\[
S = 4D - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
\]

Finally, we can find \( A \):
\[
A = S + 5 = 147 + 5 = 152
\]

To verify, we check the total:
\[
A + S + D = 152 + 147 + 40 = 339
\]
This is correct.

Thus, the number of Pokemon Stan has caught is:

1. **First leg of the journey (south)**:
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 10 hours = 300 miles

2. **Second leg of the journey (north)**:
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 miles/hour × 2 hours = 36 miles

3. **Third leg of the journey (south)**:
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 22 miles/hour × 5 hours = 110 miles

Now, we can calculate the net distance traveled south:

- \( A_s \) = boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday

From the problem, we know:
- \( G_s = 10 \) (he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread on Saturday)
- \( A_s = G_s - 4 = 10 - 4 = 6 \) (he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than gingerbread)

### Step 2: Determine the sales on Sunday
Let:
- \( G_u \) = boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday
- \( A_u \) = boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday

1. **Convert the length of the flower bed to inches**:  
   Since the flower bed is 111 feet long and there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert feet to inches:
   \[
   111 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 1332 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the space taken by each flower and the space needed between them**:  
   Each flower is 12 inches wide, and Pat wants to leave 1.5 feet (which is 18 inches) between each flower. Therefore, the total space taken by one flower and the space between it and the next flower is:
   \[
   12 \text{ inches} + 18 \text{ inches} = 30 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Determine how many flowers can fit in the flower bed**:  
   We need to find out how many sets of 30 inches fit into the total length of the flower bed (1332 inches). We can calculate this by dividing the total length by the space required for each flower and the gap:
   \[
   \text{Number of flowers} = \frac{1332 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches}} \approx 44.4

Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, it means that the next time Bill's dad saw the comet was 75 years after the first sighting. Therefore, when Bill's dad saw the comet a second time, he was:

\[
D + 75 = 30 + 75 = 105 \text{ years old}
\]

Now, we know that Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he first saw the comet. So, we need to find out what age Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time.

Let \( B \) be Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time. The problem states that when Bill saw the comet a second time, he was three times the age of his father when he first saw it. Therefore, we can express this as:

\[

\]

The remaining flights, which are \( x - \frac{3}{4}x = \frac{1}{4}x \), are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. Thus, the number of flights to France is:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{4}x \right) = \frac{1}{8}x

Substituting the known values of Akbar and Alessandro:

Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since there are 4 kids, the total size of the slices for the kids is:

\[
4x

Each adult gets a slice that is twice the size of a kid's slice, so each adult's slice is:

Since there are 2 adults, the total size of the slices for the adults is:

\text{Pictures per album} = \frac{\text{Total pictures}}{\text{Number of albums}} = \frac{72}{8} = 9
\]

This means each album contains 9 pictures.

3. **Number of selfie albums**: 3
4. **Number of portrait albums**: 2

Now, we can calculate the total number of pictures in the selfie albums and the portrait albums.

- **Total selfies**:
\[
\text{Total selfies} = \text{Number of selfie albums} \times \text{Pictures per album} = 3 \times 9 = 27
\]

- **Total portraits**:
\[
\text{Total portraits} = \text{Number of portrait albums} \times \text{Pictures per album} = 2 \times 9 = 18
\]

5. **Remaining albums**: Since there are 8 albums in total and 3 are selfies and 2 are portraits, the remaining albums are:
\[
8 - (3 + 2) = 3 \text{ albums}
\]

These remaining albums could contain other types of pictures, but we are only asked for the number of selfies and portraits.

Thus, Olivia has:
- **27 selfies**
- **18 portraits**",0.00021974999999999997,5.764735698699951,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage1_only,

According to the problem:

1. Each small stuffed animal costs $4.
2. The price of each large stuffed animal is three times that of a small one, so it costs \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.
3. Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, which gives us the equation:
   \[
   S = 2L
   \]
4. The total earnings from the sales is $120, which can be expressed as:

1. **Substitute Teacher**: There is a 50% chance that a substitute teacher will be present. If a substitute is present, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.

2. **Normal Teacher**: If the normal teacher is present (which happens with a 50% chance), we need to consider two sub-scenarios:
   - **Extension Given**: There is a 40% chance that the teacher will give everyone an extension. If this happens, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.
   - **No Extension Given**: There is a 60% chance that the teacher will not give an extension. In this case, we have another sub-scenario:
     - **Convincing the Teacher**: There is a 20% chance that Marcus can convince the teacher that his dog ate his homework and get a personal extension. If he convinces her, he does not have to turn in his homework.
     - **Not Convincing the Teacher**: There is an 80% chance that he cannot convince the teacher, meaning he will have to turn in his homework.

Now, let's calculate the probabilities step by step:

1. **Probability of having to turn in homework if the substitute is present**:
   - Probability = 50% (0.5) → Marcus does NOT have to turn in homework.

2. **Probability of having to turn in homework if the normal teacher is present**:
   - Probability of normal teacher = 50% (0.5)
   - Probability of extension = 40% (0.4) → Marcus does NOT have to turn in homework.
   - Probability of no extension = 60% (0.6)
     - Probability of convincing the teacher = 20% (0.2) → Marcus does NOT have to turn in homework.
     - Probability of not convincing the teacher = 80% (0.8) → Marcus HAS to turn in homework.

Now, we can calculate the overall probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework:

- Probability that he has to turn in homework with the normal teacher:
  - Probability of normal teacher * Probability of no extension * Probability of not convincing the teacher
  - = 0.5 * 0.6 * 0.8
  - = 0.5 * 0.48
  - = 0.24 (or 24%)

Now, since the substitute teacher scenario means he does not have to turn in homework, we only need to consider the normal teacher scenario for the final probability:

  - = Probability of having to turn in homework with normal teacher
  - = 24%

   Jim takes out $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years.
   \[
   \text{Total loans} = 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the income lost while in college:**
   Before college, Jim had a job that paid $25,000 per year. Since he is in college for 4 years, the total income he would have earned during that time is:
   \[
   \text{Income lost} = 25,000 \times 4 = 100,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost (loans + income lost):**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Total loans} + \text{Income lost} = 200,000 + 100,000 = 300,000

According to the problem:

- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took \( 2(x + 80) \).

Now, we can express the total amount they took as:

\[
x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920
\]

Now, let's simplify the left side:

1. Combine the terms:
   \[
   x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   4x + 240 = 1920
   \]

2. Now, subtract 240 from both sides:
   \[
   4x = 1920 - 240
   \]
   \[
   4x = 1680

3. Divide both sides by 4:
   \[
   x = \frac{1680}{4} = 420

Thus, the share of the first person is \( \boxed{420} \). 

To verify, we can calculate the shares of the second and third persons:

2. **Calculate the total hours worked by the team**:
   - The team worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day each day.

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.

The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is given as 19. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Now, let's simplify this equation step by step:

1. Combine like terms:
   \[
   2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
   \]

2. To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 2:
   \[
   2(2x + 4) + 2 \left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2 \cdot 19
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   4x + 8 + x = 38
   \]

3. Combine the \( x \) terms:
   \[
   5x + 8 = 38
   \]

4. Subtract 8 from both sides:
   \[
   5x = 30
   \]

5. Divide by 5:

Now that we have \( x \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in each set:
- Second set: \( x = 6 \)
- First set: \( x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \)
- Third set: \( \frac{x}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \)

1. **Calculate the total number of sheets washed each week:**
   - Greg has 4 twin beds, so he washes 4 sets of twin sheets.
   - He also has 1 king size bed, so he washes 1 set of king sheets.
   - Total sheets washed per week = 4 (twin) + 1 (king) = 5 sets of sheets.

2. **Determine how many loads of laundry he does each week:**
   - His laundry machine can wash 2 sets of twin sheets at a time. Therefore, for the 4 twin sheets:
     - He needs \( \frac{4 \text{ twin sheets}}{2 \text{ twin sheets/load}} = 2 \text{ loads for twin sheets} \).
   - His laundry machine can wash 1 set of king sheets at a time. Therefore, for the 1 king sheet:
     - He needs \( \frac{1 \text{ king sheet}}{1 \text{ king sheet/load}} = 1 \text{ load for king sheet} \).
   - Total loads of laundry per week = 2 (for twin sheets) + 1 (for king sheet) = 3 loads.

3. **Calculate the total number of loads in a year:**

2. **Becky's slices**: 
   - It is given that Becky ate 10 slices.

3. **Jake's slices**: 
   - We know that Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake. 
   - Let \( J \) be the number of slices Jake ate. 
   - According to the information, \( 10 = J + 3 \).
   - Solving for \( J \):

2. **Cost of the doctor's visit**: 
   - The doctor charges $300 per hour.
   - The visit lasts for 30 minutes, which is half an hour.
   - Therefore, the cost for the visit is:
     \[
     300 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 150 \, \text{dollars}
     \]
3. **Cost of painkillers**:
   - The cost per pill is $4.
   - For 30 painkillers, the total cost is:
     \[

     \[
     6 \text{ pounds} \times 4.00 \text{ dollars/pound} = 24.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Understanding the Promotion**:
   - The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter purchased, the second pound will cost half price.
   - Therefore, if Dennis buys 2 pounds, he pays full price for the first pound and half price for the second pound.

3. **Calculating the Cost with the Promotion**:
   - For 2 pounds of butter:
     - First pound: $4.00

   - The cost of one rose is $2.
   - Therefore, the cost for 15 roses is:
     \[
     15 \text{ roses} \times 2 \text{ dollars/rose} = 30 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate how much money Jenny has:**
   - Jenny arrived with five $5 bills.
   - The total amount of money she has is:
     \[
     5 \text{ bills} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bill} = 25 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Determine how much money she needs to pay:**
   - Jenny needs to pay $30 for the roses, but she only has $25.

4. **Calculate the difference:**
   - Jenny is short:
     \[
     30 \text{ dollars} - 25 \text{ dollars} = 5 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Since Jenny does not have enough money to pay for the roses, she cannot complete the purchase. Therefore, she leaves the florist without buying any roses and retains all her original money.

5. **Calculate the number of quarters she leaves with:**
   - Since she did not make a purchase, she still has her $25.
   - To find out how many quarters this is equivalent to:
     \[
     25 \text{ dollars} = 25 \times 4 = 100 \text{ quarters}
     \]

Thus, Jenny leaves with **100 quarters**.",0.00023189999999999997,6.862351655960083,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage1_only,

   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - Departure time: \(10 + 20 = 30\) minutes after Paul arrives.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives half an hour after the first train leaves.
   - The first train leaves at 30 minutes, so the second train arrives at \(30 + 30 = 60\) minutes.
   - The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed (which is 20 minutes).
   - Departure time: \(60 + 5 = 65\) minutes after Paul arrives.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives an hour after the second train leaves.
   - The second train leaves at 65 minutes, so the third train arrives at \(65 + 60 = 125\) minutes.
   - The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so it departs at 125 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - The third train leaves at 125 minutes, so the fourth train arrives at \(125 + 20 = 145\) minutes.

   - The distance to the store is 4 miles, so halfway to the store is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.
   - He walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.

   The time taken to walk to the halfway point is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Walking back home**:
   - After realizing he forgot something, he walks back the same 2 miles to his home.
   - The time taken to walk back is the same as the time taken to walk to the halfway point:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours}

1. **Calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought:**
   - She bought 10 bunches, and each bunch has an average of 4 bananas.
   - Total bananas = Number of bunches × Average bananas per bunch
   - Total bananas = 10 bunches × 4 bananas/bunch = 40 bananas

2. **Calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually:**
   - The cost of one banana is $0.80.

The total amount of fence they have is 100 feet, which gives us the equation:

\[
S + H = 100
\]

Substituting the expression for \( H \) into the equation, we get:

\[
S + (S + 60) = 100
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2S + 60 = 100

gsm8k,gsm8k-1093,TrustRoute-NoParallel,3,"To determine the cost of painting the room, we first need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted.

1. **Calculate the area of the north and south walls:**
   - Each wall is 10 feet wide and 8 feet high.
   - Area of one wall = width × height = 10 ft × 8 ft = 80 square feet.
   - Since there are two walls (north and south), the total area for these walls is:
     \[
     2 \times 80 \text{ sq ft} = 160 \text{ sq ft}
     \]

2. **Calculate the area of the east and west walls:**
   - Each wall is 5 feet wide and 8 feet high.
   - Area of one wall = width × height = 5 ft × 8 ft = 40 square feet.
   - Since there are two walls (east and west), the total area for these walls is:
     \[
     2 \times 40 \text{ sq ft} = 80 \text{ sq ft}

3. **Calculate the total area of all walls:**
   - Total area = area of north and south walls + area of east and west walls
   \[
   160 \text{ sq ft} + 80 \text{ sq ft} = 240 \text{ sq ft}
   \]

4. **Determine how many gallons of paint are needed:**
   - Each gallon covers 20 square feet.
   - Number of gallons needed = total area / coverage per gallon
   \[
   \frac{240 \text{ sq ft}}{20 \text{ sq ft/gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of the paint:**
   - Cost per gallon = $12.
   - Total cost = number of gallons × cost per gallon

1. **Total Sodas**: Ellen has a case of 12 sodas.
2. **Shaken Sodas**: Ellen shakes 3 of the sodas.
3. **Unshaken Sodas**: This means there are \( 12 - 3 = 9 \) unshaken sodas.
4. **Ellen's Choice**: Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself. Now, the remaining sodas are:
   - Shaken: 3
   - Unshaken: \( 9 - 1 = 8 \) (after she takes 1 unshaken soda)

5. **Ellen's Brother's Choice**: Ellen's brother takes:
   - 1 shaken soda
   - 2 unshaken sodas

   After Ellen's brother takes his sodas, the remaining sodas are:
   - Shaken: \( 3 - 1 = 2 \)
   - Unshaken: \( 8 - 2 = 6 \)

6. **Total Remaining Sodas**: After both Ellen and her brother have taken sodas, the total remaining sodas are:
   - Shaken: 2
   - Unshaken: 6

7. **Total Remaining Sodas**: \( 2 + 6 = 8 \)

8. **Probability Calculation**: The probability that Ellen's friend picks a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of remaining sodas:

1. **Calculate the production of the first two workers:**
   - Each of the first two workers produces 6 toys per hour.
   - In 10 hours, one worker produces: \( 6 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ toys} \).
   - Therefore, both workers together produce: \( 60 \text{ toys} \times 2 = 120 \text{ toys} \).

2. **Calculate the production of the next two workers:**
   - Each of the next two workers produces 4 toys per hour.
   - In 10 hours, one worker produces: \( 4 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ toys} \).
   - Therefore, both workers together produce: \( 40 \text{ toys} \times 2 = 80 \text{ toys} \).

3. **Total production of the first four workers:**
   - Total toys produced by all four workers: \( 120 \text{ toys} + 80 \text{ toys} = 200 \text{ toys} \).

4. **Determine how many toys are still needed:**
   - The order is for 400 toys, and they produced 200 toys, so they still need: 
   \[
   400 \text{ toys} - 200 \text{ toys} = 200 \text{ toys}

5. **Let \( x \) be the production rate of the fifth worker (toys per hour).**
   - The fifth worker also works for 10 hours, so in 10 hours, the fifth worker produces \( 10x \) toys.

6. **Set up the equation for total production:**
   - The total production from all five workers must equal the order:
   \[

According to the problem, Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah. We can denote the number of eggs painted by Sarah as \( y \). Therefore, Camden painted \( y + 12 \) eggs.

We can set up the following equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of eggs painted by all four is 56:
   \[
   x + x + (y + 12) + y = 56
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   2x + 2y + 12 = 56

   Subtracting 12 from both sides gives:
   \[
   2x + 2y = 44
   \]
   Dividing the entire equation by 2 results in:
   \[
   x + y = 22 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
   \]

2. We also know that Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs:
   \[
   (y + 12) + y = 30
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   2y + 12 = 30
   \]
   Subtracting 12 from both sides gives:
   \[
   2y = 18
   \]
   Dividing by 2 results in:
   \[
   y = 9 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}

Now, we can substitute \( y = 9 \) back into Equation 1:
\[
x + 9 = 22

Subtracting 9 from both sides gives:

Now we have:
- Arnold painted \( x = 13 \) eggs.

   \]

5. **Total Amount of Money They All Have Together**: Finally, we can calculate the total amount of money they all have together:
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = \text{Valerie's Earnings} + \text{Brother's Earnings} + \text{Mother's Earnings}
   \]
   \[

gsm8k,gsm8k-1133,TrustRoute-NoParallel,3,"Let's denote Grandma's walking speed on the beach as \( v \) miles per hour. Therefore, her walking speed on the sidewalk is \( 2v \) miles per hour.

We know that Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We also know that she spends 40 minutes walking on the beach.

First, we can convert the time spent on the beach into hours:

\[
40 \text{ minutes} = \frac{40}{60} \text{ hours} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ hours}
\]

Now, we can use the formula for distance, which is:

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]

For the beach, we can set up the equation:

\[
2 \text{ miles} = v \times \frac{2}{3} \text{ hours}
\]

To find \( v \), we can rearrange the equation:

\[
v = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{\frac{2}{3} \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ miles} \times \frac{3}{2} = 3 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Now that we have Grandma's speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk:

\[
\text{Speed on sidewalk} = 2v = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes her to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk. Using the formula for time:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

For the sidewalk:

\[
\text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{6 \text{ miles per hour}} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ hours}
\]

Now we convert this time into minutes:

\[
\frac{1}{6} \text{ hours} = \frac{1}{6} \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 10 \text{ minutes}
\]

Finally, we can find the total time for the entire 3-mile walk by adding the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time on beach} + \text{Time on sidewalk} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time it takes Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk is:

According to the problem, if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) marbles. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
x + 24 = 60
\]

To find \( x \), we can subtract 24 from both sides:

\[
x = 60 - 24
\]
\[
x = 36

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles.

Now, if Bob loses 10 marbles, we can calculate how many he will have left:

gsm8k,gsm8k-1137,TrustRoute-NoParallel,3,"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water, we can use the concept of weighted averages.

Let \( T \) be the temperature of the second mug of water. 

Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, resulting in a total of \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) ounces of water.

The total temperature of the water in the bottle can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total temperature} = \left( \text{temperature from the first mug} \times \text{amount from the first mug} \right) + \left( \text{temperature from the second mug} \times \text{amount from the second mug} \right)
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
\text{Total temperature} = (33 \times 4) + (T \times 1) = 132 + T
\]

Now, we need to find the average temperature of the 5 ounces of water:

\[
\text{Average temperature} = \frac{\text{Total temperature}}{\text{Total amount}} = \frac{132 + T}{5}
\]

For Donny to be able to drink the water, the average temperature must be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

To eliminate the fraction, we multiply both sides by 5:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Now, we solve for \( T \):

\[
T \geq 68

1. **Total Distance**:
   - First part: 110 miles
   - Second part: 140 miles
   - Total Distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles

2. **Total Time**:

gsm8k,gsm8k-1152,TrustRoute-NoParallel,3,"To find the probability that both lottery tickets are winners, we first need to determine the probability of winning for each ticket.

1. **First Ticket**: The probability of winning is given as 20%, which can be expressed as a decimal:
   \[
   P(\text{First Ticket}) = 0.20
   \]

2. **Second Ticket**: The second ticket is said to be three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, we calculate the probability for the second ticket:
   \[
   P(\text{Second Ticket}) = 3 \times P(\text{First Ticket}) = 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60

Now, we need to find the probability that both tickets win. Since the outcomes of the two tickets are independent, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning:
\[
P(\text{Both Tickets Win}) = P(\text{First Ticket}) \times P(\text{Second Ticket}) = 0.20 \times 0.60

- Let \( C \) be the number of seashells Carlos collected.
- Let \( J \) be the number of seashells Jim collected.
- Let \( R \) be the number of seashells Carrey collected.

From the problem, we know:

1. Jim collected 27 seashells: 
   \[
   J = 27
   \]

2. Jim collected 5 more than Carlos:
   \[
   J = C + 5
   \]
   Substituting \( J = 27 \) into this equation gives:
   \[
   27 = C + 5
   \]
   Solving for \( C \):
   \[
   C = 27 - 5 = 22
   \]

3. Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey:
   \[
   C = 2R

   Substituting \( C = 22 \) into this equation gives:
   \[
   22 = 2R

Now we have the number of seashells collected by each person:
- Carlos collected \( C = 22 \) seashells.
- Jim collected \( J = 27 \) seashells.
- Carrey collected \( R = 11 \) seashells.

Next, we calculate the total number of seashells collected:

- Let \( r \) be the length of the red rope.
- Let \( b \) be the length of the blue rope.
- Let \( y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope:
   \[
   r = 4b
   \]

2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope:
   \[
   b = y - 7
   \]

3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters:
   \[
   r + b + y = 37
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( r \) and \( b \) into the combined length equation.

Substituting \( r \) from the first equation:
\[
4b + b + y = 37
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
5b + y = 37
\]

Now, substitute \( b \) from the second equation into this equation:
\[
5(y - 7) + y = 37
\]

Distributing the 5 gives:
\[
5y - 35 + y = 37

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now:
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7)
   \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now:
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
   \]

Now we can solve these equations step by step.

### Step 1: Rewrite the equations

From the first equation:
\[
W = 5(C + 7) = 5C + 35
\]

From the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
\]

### Step 2: Substitute \( W \) in the second equation

Substituting \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35)
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the equation

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5C + 35
\]
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

### Step 4: Rearrange the equation

Rearranging gives:
\[

gsm8k,gsm8k-1187,TrustRoute-NoParallel,3,"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Building Rate**: Jay can build 20 snowballs in 1 hour (60 minutes). This means he builds:
   \[
   \text{Rate of building} = \frac{20 \text{ snowballs}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ snowballs per minute}
   \]

2. **Melting Rate**: Jay loses 2 snowballs every 15 minutes. Therefore, the melting rate is:
   \[
   \text{Rate of melting} = \frac{2 \text{ snowballs}}{15 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{2}{15} \text{ snowballs per minute}
   \]

3. **Net Rate**: The net rate at which Jay gains snowballs is the difference between the rate of building and the rate of melting:
   \[
   \text{Net rate} = \frac{1}{3} - \frac{2}{15}
   \]

   To perform this subtraction, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 15 is 15. We can convert \(\frac{1}{3}\) to have a denominator of 15:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} = \frac{5}{15}
   \]

   Now we can subtract:
   \[
   \text{Net rate} = \frac{5}{15} - \frac{2}{15} = \frac{3}{15} = \frac{1}{5} \text{ snowballs per minute}
   \]

4. **Time to Reach 60 Snowballs**: Let \( t \) be the time in minutes that Jay needs to reach 60 snowballs. The equation for the number of snowballs he has after \( t \) minutes is:
   \[
   \text{Snowballs} = \text{Net rate} \times t
   \]
   Since he starts with 0 snowballs, we set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} t = 60
   \]

   To solve for \( t \):
   \[
   t = 60 \times 5 = 300 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Thus, it will take Jay **300 minutes** to have 60 snowballs.",0.00033344999999999995,6.95129919052124,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage1_only,

1. **Determine the year Digimon was released**: Since Digimon had its 20th anniversary, it was released 20 years ago. If John is currently 28 years old, that means he was 28 - 20 = 8 years old when Digimon was released.

2. **Establish the relationship between John and Jim's ages at that time**: According to the problem, when Digimon was released, John was twice as old as Jim. If John was 8 years old, we can set up the equation:
   \[

   - The first dog needs to walk 1 mile.
   - The second dog needs to walk 4 miles.
   - The third dog needs to walk 3 miles.
   - Therefore, the total distance for the first three dogs is:
     \[
     \text{Total distance for first three dogs} = 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Determine the distance needed for the last dog**:

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   The jar has a square base with dimensions 6 inches by 6 inches and a height of 15 inches. The volume \( V \) of the jar can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:

   \[
   V = \text{base area} \times \text{height}
   \]

   The base area is:

   \[
   \text{base area} = 6 \, \text{inches} \times 6 \, \text{inches} = 36 \, \text{square inches}

Simplifying this gives:

\[
c + 3c - 2 = 10

2. **Orange candies**: The problem states that there are twice as many orange candies as red candies. Therefore:
   \[
   \text{Orange candies} = 2 \times \text{Red candies} = 2 \times 54 = 108

   - Total meditation time per day = 15 minutes + 15 minutes = 30 minutes.
   - In 4 weeks, there are 28 days (4 weeks × 7 days/week).
   - Total meditation time in 4 weeks = 30 minutes/day × 28 days = 840 minutes.

2. **Yoga:**
   - Charisma practices yoga for 1 hour, 5 days a week.
   - Total yoga time per week = 1 hour/day × 5 days = 5 hours.
   - In 4 weeks, total yoga time = 5 hours/week × 4 weeks = 20 hours.

Now, we need to convert the yoga time from hours to minutes to add it to the meditation time:
- 20 hours = 20 × 60 minutes = 1200 minutes.

3. **Total time spent on meditation and yoga:**
   - Total time = Total meditation time + Total yoga time
   - Total time = 840 minutes (meditation) + 1200 minutes (yoga) = 2040 minutes.

Therefore, in 4 weeks, Charisma has spent a total of **2040 minutes** on meditation and yoga practice.",0.00020114999999999998,5.224903106689453,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage1_only,

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of the T-shirts.**

- Original price of each T-shirt = $8
- Jake buys 2 T-shirts.

For the first T-shirt, he pays the full price:
- Cost of the first T-shirt = $8

For the second T-shirt, he gets 50% off:
- Discount on the second T-shirt = 50% of $8 = 0.5 * $8 = $4
- Cost of the second T-shirt = $8 - $4 = $4

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar.

1. **Cost of passion fruit**:
   - Amount needed: 2 pounds
   - Cost per pound: $6
   - Total cost for passion fruit: \( 2 \text{ pounds} \times 6 \text{ dollars/pound} = 12 \text{ dollars} \)

2. **Cost of jackfruit**:
   - Amount needed: 1.5 pounds
   - Cost per pound: $8

gsm8k,gsm8k-1309,TrustRoute-NoParallel,3,"Let's break down the amounts raised by each girl step by step.

1. **Alexandra's amount**: 
   - Alexandra raises $430.

2. **Kim's amount**: 
   - Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra.
   - So, Kim's amount = Alexandra's amount + $320 = $430 + $320 = $750.

3. **Sarah's amount**: 
   - Sarah raises $300.

4. **Maryam's amount**: 
   - Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah.
   - So, Maryam's amount = Sarah's amount + $400 = $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, we can calculate the total amount raised by all the girls:

- Total amount = Alexandra's amount + Kim's amount + Sarah's amount + Maryam's amount
- Total amount = $430 + $750 + $300 + $700

Calculating the total:

\[
430 + 750 = 1180
\]
\[
1180 + 300 = 1480

gsm8k,gsm8k-1310,TrustRoute-NoParallel,3,"Let's break down the information given in the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the speeds**:
   - Let \( v \) be Vanessa's speed in miles per minute.
   - Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, his speed is \( 2v \).

2. **Distance run**:
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles.
   - Let’s denote the distance Aaron ran as \( d_A \).

3. **Time taken by Aaron**:
   - We know that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. 
   - The formula for time is:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
     \]
   - Therefore, for Aaron:
     \[
     16 = \frac{d_A}{2v}
     \]
   - Rearranging gives:
     \[
     d_A = 16 \times 2v = 32v
     \]

4. **Distance relationship**:
   - The problem states that Vanessa can run twice as far as Aaron. Thus:
     \[
     4 = 2d_A
     \]
   - Substituting \( d_A \) from the previous equation:
     \[
     4 = 2(32v)
     \]
   - Simplifying gives:
     \[
     4 = 64v
     \]
   - Solving for \( v \):
     \[
     v = \frac{4}{64} = \frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute}
     \]

5. **Calculating Vanessa's time**:
   - Now we can find the time it took Vanessa to run 4 miles:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{4}{v} = \frac{4}{\frac{1}{16}} = 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ minutes}

gsm8k,gsm8k-1317,TrustRoute-NoParallel,3,"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( W \).

We have two equations based on the information provided:

1. The total number of animals:
   \[
   C + W = 20
   \]

2. The total number of legs (chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs):
   \[
   2C + 4W = 70
   \]

Now, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[
C + 2W = 35
\]

Now we have the system of equations:
1. \( C + W = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2W = 35 \)

Next, we can solve these equations. We can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(C + 2W) - (C + W) = 35 - 20
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
W = 15
\]

Now that we have \( W \), we can substitute it back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[
C + 15 = 20
\]
\[
C = 20 - 15 = 5
