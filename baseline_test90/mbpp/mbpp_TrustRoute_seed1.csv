mbpp,Mbpp/247,TrustRoute,1,"The length of the longest palindromic subsequence (LPS) can be found using dynamic programming.
Let `dp[i][j]` be the length of the longest palindromic subsequence of the substring `s[i...j]`.

The recurrence relation is as follows:
1.  **Base Case**: If `i == j` (substring of length 1), `dp[i][j] = 1`. A single character is a palindrome.
2.  **Recursive Step**:
    *   If `s[i] == s[j]`: The characters at the ends match. This means they can be part of the LPS. The length will be 2 (for `s[i]` and `s[j]`) plus the LPS of the inner substring `s[i+1...j-1]`. So, `dp[i][j] = 2 + dp[i+1][j-1]`.
    *   If `s[i] != s[j]`: The characters at the ends do not match. We must exclude either `s[i]` or `s[j]` to form a palindrome. The length will be the maximum of the LPS of `s[i+1...j]` (excluding `s[i]`) and `s[i...j-1]` (excluding `s[j]`). So, `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1])`.

The `dp` table is filled iteratively, starting with substrings of length 1, then length 2, and so on, up to the full string length `n`.

Wait, I need to reconsider. Looking at the assertion, it seems the function takes two parameters and returns a tuple with magnitude/phase and the complex number. Let me check the expected output:

Actually, reviewing the assertion more carefully: `polar_rect(3,4)` returns `((5.0, 0.9272952180016122), (-2+2.4492935982947064e-16j))`. This suggests the inputs might be rectangular coordinates being converted to polar, then back. Let me reconsider:

```python

    z = complex(x, y)
    magnitude = abs(z)
    phase = cmath.phase(z)
    polar = (magnitude, phase)

mbpp,Mbpp/260,TrustRoute,1,"To find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams (NSW) prime number, we first need to understand the NSW sequence.
The NSW numbers are defined by the recurrence relation:
$S_0 = 1$
$S_1 = 1$
$S_n = 2 \cdot S_{n-1} + S_{n-2}$ for $n \ge 2$

Let's list the first few NSW numbers:
$S_0 = 1$
$S_1 = 1$
$S_2 = 2 \cdot S_1 + S_0 = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3$
$S_3 = 2 \cdot S_2 + S_1 = 2 \cdot 3 + 1 = 7$
$S_4 = 2 \cdot S_3 + S_2 = 2 \cdot 7 + 3 = 17$

The problem's assertion `assert newman_prime(3) == 7` indicates that the function `newman_prime(n)` should return the value of $S_n$. The term ""prime number"" in the function's name implies that for the given `n`, the corresponding $S_n$ will indeed be a prime number.

Therefore, the task is to implement the calculation of the $n$-th term of the NSW sequence.

```python
def newman_prime(n: int) -> int:
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    if n == 1:
        return 1

    s_prev2 = 1  # Corresponds to S_0
    s_prev1 = 1  # Corresponds to S_1

    # Calculate S_n iteratively
    for _ in range(2, n + 1):
        s_current = 2 * s_prev1 + s_prev2
        s_prev2 = s_prev1
        s_prev1 = s_current
    
    return s_prev1
