Wait, let me reconsider. The function needs to work for numbers of any size, and we need to determine what ""even bits"" means (0-indexed or 1-indexed) based on the test case.

For n=10 (binary: 1010), if the result is 10, it means even bits (0-indexed: bits 0,2,4,6...) are already set or we're using 1-indexed where bits 1,3,5,7... are ""odd"".

Let me verify: 10 in binary is 1010 (bits 3,1 are set). If ""even bits"" means bit positions 0,2,4,6... (0-indexed), setting them would give us 1010 | 0101... But that would change the number.

Since the output is 10, ""even bits"" likely means bit positions 1,3,5,7... (1-indexed as ""even positions"") or the existing bits are already the even ones.

Actually, looking at 1010: positions from right are bit0=0, bit1=1, bit2=0, bit3=1. If ""even bits"" means bit1,3,5,7 (odd indices), then 0xAAAA... mask works.

```python
def even_bit_set_number(n):
    mask = 0xAAAAAAAA & ((1 << n.bit_length()) - 1) if n > 0 else 0
    return n | mask
```

Actually, simpler:
