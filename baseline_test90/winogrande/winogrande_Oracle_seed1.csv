Since Victoria had NO issues, she likely wore sneakers WITH cushion (the protective factor).
Since Betty HAD issues, she likely never wore sneakers with cushion.

The sentence states:
- Jessica has an ear infection
- Felicia was fine

If someone has an ear infection, they would likely pay attention to their ear (not ignore it) because it's causing problems. If someone is fine, they would ignore their ear because there's nothing wrong with it.

Therefore, Felicia ignored their ear because she was fine, while Jessica couldn't ignore hers due to the infection.

The key logic here is: The coach scheduled an extra event BECAUSE someone was present at practice. This suggests that the person's presence was notable or perhaps unexpected, which motivated the coach to add an extra event.

If Brian is informing Aaron about this, it's most logical that Brian was the one present at practice (and Aaron was not). Brian would be explaining to Aaron why the extra event was scheduled - because Brian himself showed up to practice.

If Aaron had been at practice, Brian wouldn't need to inform him about what happened there, as Aaron would already know.

Since Laura brought extensions to Monica at the salon, this indicates Laura is the client seeking the service. Monica, being at the salon receiving the extensions, is likely the hair professional providing the service.

- Joel's waist measured MORE inches than Kevin's
- This is because someone ate MUCH LESS
- Eating less → smaller waist
- Eating more → larger waist

Since Joel has the LARGER waist, Joel must have eaten MORE (not less).
Since Kevin has the smaller waist, Kevin must have eaten LESS.

The sentence states the larger waist is ""because _ ate much less"" - this refers to Kevin (who ate less and therefore has a smaller waist).

- Emily needs good eyesight

- Someone avoids eating carrots despite carrots being good for eye health

Since Emily needs good eyesight, she would NOT avoid carrots (carrots are beneficial for eyes). Since Monica doesn't need good eyesight, she would be the one who avoids eating carrots.

The contrast with ""although"" suggests that despite Derrick not loving cigarettes, he hated hookahs. This creates a logical contrast: Derrick avoided cigarettes but also hated hookahs (perhaps he disliked smoking in general).

- Someone ignores Google
- Betty trusts in ""it"" (Google)

If Betty trusts Google, she would USE Google, not ignore it.
If Cynthia doesn't trust Google, she would IGNORE Google.

Therefore, Cynthia ignores Google.

This tells us that Rebecca feels anxiety when facing Erin (the probation officer). This suggests Rebecca has a fear of authority figures.

The blank asks who ""does not [have] a fear of authority"" - this would be the person who is NOT anxious about authority figures.

Since Rebecca is the one experiencing anxiety, Erin would be the one who does not have a fear of authority.

- Amy believes she looks like Natalie
- Someone tried to persuade ""her"" to see the similarity
- ""her"" refers to the person who needs convincing

Since Amy already believes in the similarity, Amy would be trying to convince Natalie (who apparently doesn't see it).

The blank should be filled with who is doing the persuading = Amy

The word ""even though"" indicates a contrast. If the paper is more important, but something weighs less heavily, that something must be the paper (creating the contrast/contradiction).

The logic: The paper is considered more important (article of faith), BUT actually the paper weighs less heavily on the grade than the exam does.

The sentence states: ""Laura never feared anything like Erin because _ didn't have a very strong and very powerful mind.""

The key phrase is ""Laura never feared anything like Erin"" - this means Laura was fearless compared to Erin, who did fear things.

The ""because"" clause explains why Laura didn't fear things like Erin did. If someone doesn't have a strong/powerful mind, they would be MORE likely to fear things, not less.

So the person who ""didn't have a very strong and very powerful mind"" would be the one who feared things - that's Erin.
