winogrande,winogrande-529,TrustRoute,1,"Looking at this sentence, I need to determine who was out of shape based on the logic presented.

The sentence states: ""The personal trainer gave Laura but not Victoria the more difficult exercise because _ was out of shape.""

If someone is out of shape, a personal trainer would typically give them easier exercises, not more difficult ones. However, the sentence says Laura got the MORE difficult exercise.

This means Laura must have been IN shape (fit enough to handle difficult exercises), while Victoria was out of shape (and therefore got easier exercises).

The blank asks who ""was out of shape"" - that would be Victoria.

If John wants air to blow around the cold cup, it would be to warm it up. This means the air must be warm (warmer than the cup).

The sentence states that Lawrence liked watching foreign movies with subtitles, UNLIKE Jason. This contrast is explained by the fact that someone criticized the original language.

If someone criticizes the original language of a film, they would be less likely to enjoy watching foreign movies in their original language with subtitles.

Since Lawrence LIKED watching them (unlike Jason), it must be Jason who criticized the original language, which explains why Jason didn't share Lawrence's enjoyment.

winogrande,winogrande-1204,TrustRoute,1,"Looking at this sentence, I need to determine who or what ""were cautious.""

The sentence describes a shoddy (poorly made) bridge that held secure while cars transported passengers. Given that the bridge is described as ""shoddy,"" it makes sense that someone would be cautious about using it.

Cars cannot be cautious - they are inanimate objects. Passengers, being people, can feel and express caution, especially when crossing a bridge described as ""shoddy.""
