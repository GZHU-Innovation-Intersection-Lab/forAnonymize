gsm8k,gsm8k-0,TrustRoute,1,"To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market from selling her duck eggs, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of eggs laid per day**: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day.

2. **Calculate the number of eggs she uses for breakfast and baking**:
   - She eats 3 eggs for breakfast.
   - She uses 4 eggs for baking muffins.
   - Total eggs used = 3 (breakfast) + 4 (baking) = 7 eggs.

3. **Calculate the number of eggs remaining for sale**:
   - Eggs remaining = Total eggs laid - Eggs used
   - Eggs remaining = 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

4. **Calculate the revenue from selling the remaining eggs**:
   - Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 per egg.
   - Total revenue = Number of eggs sold × Price per egg
   - Total revenue = 9 eggs × $2/egg = $18.

Therefore, Janet makes **$18** every day at the farmers' market.",0.0014178500000000002,21.51729726791382,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,

gsm8k,gsm8k-4,TrustRoute,1,"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of feed needed for the chickens for the day:**
   Each chicken receives 3 cups of feed per day. Since Wendi has 20 chickens, the total feed needed for the day is:
   \[
   \text{Total feed} = \text{Number of chickens} \times \text{Feed per chicken} = 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ cups}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:**
   In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups of feed, and in the afternoon, she gives 25 cups of feed. Therefore, the total feed given so far is:
   \[
   \text{Total feed given} = \text{Morning feed} + \text{Afternoon feed} = 15 + 25 = 40 \text{ cups}
   \]

3. **Calculate the amount of feed needed for the final meal:**
   To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the total feed given from the total feed needed:
   \[
   \text{Final meal feed} = \text{Total feed} - \text{Total feed given} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ cups}

Thus, Wendi needs to give her chickens **20 cups of feed** in the final meal of the day.",0.0028715499999999996,16.193569898605347,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,
gsm8k,gsm8k-5,TrustRoute,1,"To calculate the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure:

1. The first glass costs $5.
2. Every second glass costs 60% of the price of the first glass.

Let's break it down:

- The cost of the first glass is $5.
- The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5:
  \[
  0.6 \times 5 = 3
  \]

Now, we can see that the pattern continues for every pair of glasses:
- The cost of the third glass is $5.
- The cost of the fourth glass is $3.

This pattern repeats for every two glasses. Therefore, for every two glasses, the total cost is:
\[
5 + 3 = 8
\]

Now, since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can determine how many pairs of glasses he is buying:
\[
\text{Number of pairs} = \frac{16}{2} = 8
\]

Now we can calculate the total cost for 8 pairs:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 8 \times 8 = 64

Thus, Kylar needs to pay a total of **$64** for the 16 glasses.",0.0021611499999999997,14.556682109832764,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_confidence,

- Let \( S \) be the number of sheep in Seattle.
- Let \( C \) be the number of sheep in Charleston.

From the problem, we know the following:

1. Seattle has 20 sheep: 
   \[
   S = 20

2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle:
   \[
   C = 4 \times S = 4 \times 20 = 80

3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston:

1. **First Month Downloads**: 
   - The program had 60 downloads.

2. **Second Month Downloads**: 
   - The number of downloads in the second month was three times the downloads in the first month.
   - So, second month downloads = \( 3 \times 60 = 180 \).

3. **Third Month Downloads**: 
   - The number of downloads in the third month was reduced by 30% from the second month.
   - First, we calculate 30% of the second month downloads: 
     \[
     30\% \text{ of } 180 = 0.30 \times 180 = 54
     \]
   - Now, we subtract this from the second month downloads to find the third month downloads:

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months**: 
   - Now, we add the downloads from all three months:
