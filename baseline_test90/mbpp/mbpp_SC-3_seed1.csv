mbpp,Mbpp/620,SC-3,1,"To solve the problem of finding the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair in the subset is divisible, we can use a dynamic programming approach. Here's how we can implement this:

1. **Sort the List**: Start by sorting the list of numbers. This helps in easily checking divisibility.
2. **Dynamic Programming Array**: Create a DP array where `dp[i]` will store the size of the largest divisible subset that ends with the element at index `i`.
3. **Nested Loop**: For each element, check all previous elements to see if they can form a divisible pair. If they can, update the DP array accordingly.
4. **Result**: The result will be the maximum value in the DP array.

Here's the implementation of the above logic in Python:

```python
def largest_subset(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    
    # Sort the numbers
    nums.sort()
    
    # Initialize the DP array
    n = len(nums)
    dp = [1] * n  # Each number can be a subset of size 1
    
    # Fill the DP array
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:  # Check if nums[i] is divisible by nums[j]
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    
    # The size of the largest subset will be the maximum value in dp
    return max(dp)

# Test the function with the provided assertion
assert largest_subset([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]) == 4
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We first check if the input list is empty and return 0 if it is.
- We sort the list to ensure that we can easily check divisibility.
- We initialize a DP array with 1s since the minimum size of any subset is 1 (the number itself).
- We use two nested loops to check each pair of numbers. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, we update `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value or `dp[j] + 1`.
- Finally, we return the maximum value from the DP array, which represents the size of the largest divisible subset.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2), which is efficient for moderate-sized lists.",0.0009370499999999,18.60774326324463,0,0,gpt-4o-mini,,

mbpp,Mbpp/125,SC-3,1,"To solve the problem of finding the maximum difference between the number of 0s and the number of 1s in any substring of a given binary string, we can approach it by transforming the problem into a numerical one. 

We can replace each '0' with +1 and each '1' with -1. The goal then becomes finding the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray in this transformed array. This can be efficiently solved using Kadane's algorithm.

Here's the implementation of the function:

```python

2. **Kadane's Algorithm**: We iterate through the transformed array to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray. This maximum sum corresponds to the maximum difference between the number of 0s and 1s in any substring.
3. **Return Value**: The function returns the maximum difference found.

The idea is to maintain an array that keeps track of the maximum product of increasing subsequences ending at each index.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. Initialize an array `max_prod` where `max_prod[i]` will store the maximum product of an increasing subsequence that ends with the element at index `i`.
2. Set each element of `max_prod` to the corresponding element of the input array since the minimum product for any single element is the element itself.
3. Iterate through each pair of indices `(i, j)` where `j < i`. If the element at index `j` is less than the element at index `i`, update `max_prod[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and the product of `max_prod[j]` and the element at index `i`.
4. Finally, the result will be the maximum value in the `max_prod` array.

Here is the implementation of the above logic in Python:

```python

### Explanation:
- We create a list `max_sum` to store the maximum sum of increasing subsequences ending at each index up to `i`.

### Explanation:
1. **Preprocessing**: The function first removes spaces and converts the string to lowercase to ensure that the comparison is case insensitive and ignores spaces.
2. **Dynamic Programming Table**: A 2D list `dp` is created where `dp[i][j]` will hold the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the substring `s[i:j+1]`.
3. **Initialization**: Each character is a palindrome of length 1, so we initialize `dp[i][i]` to 1.
4. **Filling the Table**: We iterate over all possible substring lengths and fill the `dp` table based on whether the characters at the current ends of the substring are equal or not.
5. **Result**: The length of the longest palindromic subsequence for the entire string is found in `dp[0][n-1]`.

The even index binomial coefficients for a given \( n \) are \( C(n, 0), C(n, 2), C(n, 4), \ldots \) up to the largest even index less than or equal to \( n \).

We can implement this in Python as follows:

The idea is to maintain a DP table where each entry represents the maximum total cost to reach that cell, along with the number of cells visited to compute the average.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Initialization**: Start by initializing a DP table where each cell will store a tuple of (total cost, number of cells visited).

2. **Base Case**: The starting cell (0,0) will have its cost as the value of the matrix at that position and the number of cells visited will be 1.

3. **Filling the DP Table**: Iterate through the matrix, and for each cell, update the possible paths coming from the top and left cells. For each path, calculate the new total cost and the new number of cells visited.

4. **Calculating the Maximum Average**: Once the DP table is filled, the maximum average can be calculated from the bottom-right cell by dividing the total cost by the number of cells visited.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the maximum average.

mbpp,Mbpp/592,SC-3,1,"To solve the problem of finding the sum of the product of consecutive binomial coefficients, we can define a function that calculates the binomial coefficients using the formula \( C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \) and then computes the required sum.

Here's the implementation of the function `sum_of_product`:

```python
from math import comb

# Test the function with the provided assertion
assert sum_of_product(3) == 15
```

### Explanation:
1. We use the `comb` function from the `math` module to compute binomial coefficients efficiently.
2. We iterate through values of \( k \) from 0 to \( n-1 \) (since we need \( k \) and \( k+1 \)).
3. For each \( k \), we calculate the product of \( C(n, k) \) and \( C(n, k+1) \) and accumulate this into `total_sum`.
4. Finally, we return the computed sum.

### Explanation:
1. **Function Definition**: The function `get_total_number_of_sequences(m, n)` takes two parameters, `m` and `n`.
2. **Memoization**: We use a dictionary `memo` to store results of previously computed states to avoid redundant calculations.
3. **Recursive Function**: The inner function `count_sequences(last_element, length)` computes the number of valid sequences of a given length starting from a specified last element.
4. **Base Case**: If the length of the sequence is 0, it means we have successfully formed a valid sequence, so we return 1.
5. **Counting Sequences**: We start from `last_element * 2` and count all valid sequences that can be formed by incrementing the next element until it exceeds `m`.
6. **Iterate Over First Element**: We iterate over all possible first elements from 1 to `m` and sum up the counts of sequences starting from each first element.
7. **Return Result**: Finally, we return the total count of valid sequences.

mbpp,Mbpp/799,SC-3,1,"To implement a function that rotates the bits of a given 32-bit number to the left by a specified number of bits, we can follow these steps:

1. Use bitwise operations to achieve the rotation.
2. Ensure that the rotation is within the bounds of 32 bits.
3. Return the result after performing the rotation.

Here’s the implementation of the `left_rotate` function:

### Explanation:
- `n << d` shifts the bits of `n` to the left by `d` positions.
- `n >> (32 - d)` shifts the bits of `n` to the right by `(32 - d)` positions, which effectively wraps the bits around.
- The bitwise OR (`|`) combines the two results to achieve the rotation.

### Explanation:
1. We initialize `max_product`, `min_product`, and `result` with the first element of the array.
2. We iterate through the array starting from the second element.
3. If the current element is negative, we swap `max_product` and `min_product` because multiplying by a negative number will turn the maximum into a minimum and vice versa.
4. We update `max_product` to be the maximum of the current element and the product of `max_product` with the current element.
5. We update `min_product` similarly.

2. **Finding a Solution**: In the `find_solution` function, we first check if \( n \) is a multiple of the gcd of \( a \) and \( b \). If it is not, then no integer solutions exist, and we return `None`.
3. **Scaling the Solution**: If a solution exists, we scale the coefficients \( x_0 \) and \( y_0 \) obtained from the Extended GCD to find \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy \( ax + by = n \).

3. Store the resulting sums as tuples in a result list.
4. Ensure that we do not include duplicate combinations.

### Explanation:
- We use a nested loop to iterate through all pairs of tuples.
- We check that we are not adding the same tuple to itself by using `if i != j`.

mbpp,Mbpp/735,SC-3,1,"To create a Python function that toggles the bits of a number except for the first and last bits, we can follow these steps:

1. Convert the number to its binary representation.
2. Identify the first and last bits.
3. Toggle the bits in between.
4. Convert the modified binary representation back to a decimal number.

Here's the implementation of the `toggle_middle_bits` function:

```python

    # Convert the new binary string back to a decimal number
    return int(new_binary, 2)

# Test the function with the provided assertion
assert toggle_middle_bits(9) == 15
```

### Explanation:
- We first convert the number to its binary representation using `bin(n)`.
- We check if the binary representation has less than 3 bits. If it does, we return the number as is since there are no middle bits to toggle.
- We toggle the bits in the middle by iterating through the substring of the binary representation that excludes the first and last bits.
- Finally, we construct the new binary string and convert it back to a decimal integer using `int(new_binary, 2)`.

mbpp,Mbpp/564,SC-3,1,"To solve the problem of counting the number of possible unordered pairs of unequal elements from a list of integers, we can follow these steps:

1. Use a set to identify unique elements in the list.
2. Count the number of unique elements.
3. Calculate the number of unordered pairs that can be formed from these unique elements.

Here's the implementation of the function:

```python
def count_Pairs(lst, n):

    unique_elements = set(lst)

- We then check how many unique elements there are. If there are fewer than 2, we return 0 since we can't form a pair.
- If there are at least 2 unique elements, we calculate the number of unordered pairs using the formula for combinations, specifically \( C(n, 2) = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).

This means that for a given `n`, we can either take the sum of the function evaluated at `n/2`, `n/3`, `n/4`, and `n/5`, or we can take `n` itself, whichever is larger.

We can use memoization to optimize the recursive calls, storing previously computed results to avoid redundant calculations.

2. **Finding Pairs**: For each number in the list, we calculate its complement (the number that, when added to it, equals `target_sum`). We then check how many times this complement appears in the dictionary.
3. **Adjusting for Same Numbers**: If the number and its complement are the same (e.g., when both are 1 and the target sum is 2), we subtract one from the count to avoid counting the pair (1, 1) twice.
4. **Final Count**: Since each pair is counted twice (once for each order), we divide the final count by 2 before returning it.

### Explanation:
1. **Input Length Check**: First, we check if the lengths of the two arrays are the same. If not, they cannot follow the same pattern.
2. **Mapping Creation**: We use two dictionaries:
   - `pattern_to_value` to map each unique pattern to its corresponding value.
   - `value_to_pattern` to map each unique value back to its corresponding pattern.
3. **Consistency Check**: As we iterate through both arrays:
   - If a pattern has been seen before, we check if it maps to the same value. If not, we return `False`.
   - Similarly, if a value has been seen before, we check if it maps to the same pattern. If not, we return `False`.
4. **Return True**: If we finish iterating without inconsistencies, we return `True`.

2. **Kadane's Algorithm**: We can use Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum in a single instance of the array.

3. **Handling Repeats**: When the array is repeated, we need to consider:
   - The maximum subarray sum within a single instance of the array.
   - The maximum subarray sum that spans across two instances of the array (which can happen if we take elements from the end of one instance and the beginning of the next).
   - If `k` is greater than 2, we can also consider the case where we take the entire array multiple times.

This will allow you to efficiently determine the index at which the value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order. Here's how you can implement this in Python:

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: We start with two pointers, `low` and `high`, which represent the current search range in the array.
2. **Binary Search**: We repeatedly calculate the middle index `mid` and compare the value at this index with the target value:
   - If the value at `mid` is less than or equal to the target value, it means the target could be inserted after `mid`, so we move the `low` pointer to `mid + 1`.
   - If the value at `mid` is greater than the target value, we adjust the `high` pointer to `mid`.
3. **Return the Insertion Point**: When the loop ends, `low` will be the correct index where the value should be inserted to maintain sorted order.

mbpp,Mbpp/300,SC-3,1,"To solve the problem of counting binary sequences of length \(2n\) where the sum of the first \(n\) bits is equal to the sum of the last \(n\) bits, we can use combinatorial mathematics.

The key observation is that for a binary sequence of length \(2n\), the sum of the first \(n\) bits can range from \(0\) to \(n\). For each possible sum \(k\) (where \(0 \leq k \leq n\)), the number of ways to choose \(k\) bits to be \(1\) from \(n\) bits is given by the binomial coefficient \(C(n, k)\). The same applies to the last \(n\) bits.

Thus, the total number of valid sequences can be computed as follows:

1. For each possible sum \(k\) from \(0\) to \(n\):
   - Count the ways to select \(k\) bits to be \(1\) in the first half (which is \(C(n, k)\)).
   - Count the ways to select \(k\) bits to be \(1\) in the second half (which is also \(C(n, k)\)).
   - The total contribution for each \(k\) is \(C(n, k) \times C(n, k)\).

mbpp,Mbpp/123,SC-3,1,"To solve the problem of summing all amicable numbers from 1 to a specified number, we first need to understand what amicable numbers are. Two numbers are considered amicable if the sum of the proper divisors of each number equals the other number.

Here's how we can implement the function `amicable_numbers_sum`:

1. Create a helper function to calculate the sum of proper divisors of a number.
2. Iterate through all numbers up to the specified limit and check for amicable pairs.
3. Keep track of the amicable numbers and sum them up.

Here’s the implementation:

```python
def sum_of_proper_divisors(n):
    """"""Return the sum of proper divisors of n.""""""
    if n < 2:
        return 0
    total = 1  # Start with 1 since it's a proper divisor of any n > 1
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            total += i
            if i != n // i:  # Add the complementary divisor if it's different

### Explanation:
- The `sum_of_proper_divisors` function calculates the sum of all proper divisors of a given number `n`.
- The `amicable_numbers_sum` function iterates through numbers from 2 to the specified limit, checking for amicable pairs. If a pair is found, both numbers are added to a set to avoid duplicates.
