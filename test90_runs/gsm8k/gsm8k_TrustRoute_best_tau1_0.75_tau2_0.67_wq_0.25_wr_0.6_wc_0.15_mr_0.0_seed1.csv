gsm8k,gsm8k-205,TrustRoute,1,"Brinley has scores of 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86 on the first five tests. To find the score she needs on the sixth test (let's call it \(x\)) so that her average of the five highest scores is 93, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Understand the problem
- There are six tests in total.
- The lowest score is removed, and the average is calculated from the remaining five scores.
- We want the average of those five scores to be 93, so their total sum must be \(93 \times 5 = 465\).

### Step 2: Calculate the sum of the current scores
The current scores are: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86.  
Sum = \(89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438\).

### Step 3: Consider the sixth score \(x\)
The six scores will be: 89, 71, 92, 100, 86, and \(x\).  
The total sum of all six scores is \(438 + x\).

- The lowest score among these six will be removed.
- If \(x \geq 71\) (the current lowest score), then 71 is removed, and the sum of the remaining five scores is \((438 + x) - 71 = 367 + x\).
- We need this sum to be 465:  
  \(367 + x = 465\)  
  \(x = 465 - 367 = 98\).

- Now, verify: If \(x = 98\), the scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, 86, and 98.  
  The lowest is 71, so remove it.  
  Remaining scores: 89, 92, 100, 86, 98.  
  Sum = \(89 + 92 + 100 + 86 + 98 = 465\).  
  Average = \(465 / 5 = 93\).

- If \(x < 71\), then \(x\) would be the lowest, and the sum of the remaining five scores would be 438 (the sum of the original scores). But 438 is not equal to 465, so this is impossible.

### Step 4: Conclusion
Brinley needs a score of 98 on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score.",0.005940699999999999,22.747317790985107,0,0,cand-grok-3-mini,stage2_confidence,

### Step 1: Define the variables
- Let \( r \) represent the number of red chickens.
- Since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, the number of white chickens is \( r + 2 \).

### Step 2: Set up the equation based on the egg production
- Red chickens produce 3 eggs each per day, so the total eggs from red chickens are \( 3r \).
- White chickens produce 5 eggs each per day, so the total eggs from white chickens are \( 5(r + 2) \).
- The total eggs collected daily is 42, so we can write the equation:
  \[
  3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
  \]

### Step 3: Solve the equation
- Expand the equation:
  \[
  3r + 5r + 10 = 42
  \]
- Combine like terms:
  \[
  8r + 10 = 42
  \]
- Subtract 10 from both sides:
  \[
  8r = 32
  \]
- Divide both sides by 8:
  \[
  r = 4
  \]

### Step 4: Verify the solution
- If there are 4 red chickens, then there are \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) white chickens.
- Eggs from red chickens: \( 4 \times 3 = 12 \)
- Eggs from white chickens: \( 6 \times 5 = 30 \)
- Total eggs: \( 12 + 30 = 42 \), which matches the given information.

gsm8k,gsm8k-212,TrustRoute,1,"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the edge of the rectangular park, let's reason through the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the problem
- The park is a rectangle with dimensions 1.5 miles by 6 miles.
- Gary is walking around the edge, which means he's walking the perimeter of the rectangle.
- His walking speed is 3 miles per hour.
- We need to calculate the total time spent walking.

### Step 2: Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle
- The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:  
  \( P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \)
- Here, the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles.  
  \( P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \) miles.

So, Gary walks a total distance of 15 miles.

### Step 3: Calculate the time spent walking
- Time is calculated using the formula:  
  \( \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \)
- Distance = 15 miles  
- Speed = 3 miles per hour  
  \( \text{Time} = \frac{15}{3} = 5 \) hours.

2. **Customers on the second day**: She counted 50 more customers than the first day. So, the number of customers on the second day is:
   \[
   100 + 50 = 150

Let me define variables:
- Let S = amount of water in the small pool now (in gallons)
- Let B = amount of water in the big pool now (in gallons)

**Setting up equations based on the given information:**

**Current situation (now):**
- Big pool has four times as much water as small pool
- B = 4S

**Situation 4 minutes ago:**
- Each pool loses 4 gallons/minute
- In 4 minutes, each pool lost: 4 × 4 = 16 gallons
- 4 minutes ago, small pool had: S + 16 gallons
- 4 minutes ago, big pool had: B + 16 gallons
- At that time, big pool had twice as much as small pool
- B + 16 = 2(S + 16)

**Solving the system of equations:**

From the second equation:
B + 16 = 2(S + 16)
B + 16 = 2S + 32
B = 2S + 16

Now I have two expressions for B:
- B = 4S (from current situation)
- B = 2S + 16 (from 4 minutes ago)

Setting them equal:

2S = 16
S = 8

### Step 1: Calculate the base cost of the cars
- Each car costs $20,000.
- There are 12 cars.
- Total base cost = 12 × $20,000 = $240,000.

### Step 2: Calculate the tax
- Mark pays 10% tax on the base cost of the cars.
- Tax amount = 10% of $240,000 = 0.10 × $240,000 = $24,000.

### Step 3: Calculate the registration fee
- Registration fee is $1,000 per car.
- For 12 cars, total registration fee = 12 × $1,000 = $12,000.

### Step 4: Calculate the total payment
- Total payment = Base cost + Tax + Registration fee
- Total payment = $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

So, Mark pays a total of **$276,000** for everything. If you have any additional questions or need further clarification, let me know!",0.00361356,12.215283870697021,0,0,cand-grok-3-mini,stage2_confidence,

The school is 50% boys and 50% girls, so there are \(0.5 \times 60 = 30\) boys and 30 girls in total.

- The first class has 15 girls, so the number of boys in the first class is \(20 - 15 = 5\).

From the problem, we have the following two equations:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
   \[
   R = 6S
   \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
   \[
   R + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation. 

Substituting \( R = 6S \) into the second equation gives us:
\[
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
\]

Now, let's simplify the right side:
\[
6S + 9 = 3S + 27
\]

Next, we can isolate \( S \) by moving all terms involving \( S \) to one side and constant terms to the other side:
\[
6S - 3S = 27 - 9
\]
\[
3S = 18
\]

Now, divide both sides by 3:
\[
S = 6
\]

So, Sam is currently \( 6 \) years old.

To find Ruby's age, we can substitute \( S \) back into the first equation:
\[
R = 6S = 6 \times 6 = 36
\]

Thus, Ruby is \( 36 \) years old.

To verify, in 9 years:
- Sam will be \( 6 + 9 = 15 \)
- Ruby will be \( 36 + 9 = 45 \)

And indeed, \( 45 \) is \( 3 \times 15 \).

**Given information:**
- Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds
- Each truck can carry 2000 pounds maximum
- Total flagstones to transport: 80

**Step 1: Calculate the total weight of all flagstones**
Total weight = 80 flagstones × 75 pounds per flagstone
Total weight = 6,000 pounds

**Step 2: Calculate how many flagstones one truck can carry**
Flagstones per truck = 2000 pounds ÷ 75 pounds per flagstone
Flagstones per truck = 26.67 flagstones

Since we can't split flagstones, one truck can carry 26 complete flagstones.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of trucks needed**
Number of trucks = 80 flagstones ÷ 26 flagstones per truck
Number of trucks = 3.08 trucks

Since we need whole trucks, we must round up.

**Answer: 4 trucks will be needed**

To verify:
- 3 trucks can carry: 3 × 26 = 78 flagstones (not enough)
- 4 trucks can carry: 4 × 26 = 104 flagstones (sufficient for 80)

1.  **A single piece of paper has two sides:** A front and a back.
2.  **Folding vertically:** When you fold a piece of paper vertically (in half), each side of the paper effectively creates two ""panels"" or ""surfaces.""
3.  **Pages per sheet:** Since the paper is printed on both sides and then folded, a single sheet contributes 4 numbered pages to the final tabloid.
    *   For example, if you lay a sheet flat, one side might have page 32 and page 1.
    *   The other side of the same sheet would then have page 2 and page 31.
    *   When folded, this single sheet makes up the very first and very last pages of the tabloid: page 1 (front cover), page 2 (inside front), page 31 (inside back), and page 32 (back cover).

The description in the prompt (""page 1 is printed on the left back, page 2 is printed on the left front, and then, perhaps page 32 is printed on the right back, and page 31 is printed on the right front"") confirms this standard printing arrangement where a single physical sheet, printed on both sides and folded, accounts for 4 distinct pages (e.g., the outermost pages of a booklet signature).

Given this, we can calculate the number of sheets needed:

    The collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between the Rottweiler and Chihuahua beds.
    Average = (8 pounds + 2 pounds) / 2
    Average = 10 pounds / 2
    Average = 5 pounds
    So, a collie bed takes 5 pounds of stuffing.

- Let \( m \) be the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks. According to the problem, \( m = 3 \).
- Let \( s \) be the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting. The problem states that the number of shoplifters is equal to four times the number of mask-refusing customers minus 5. Therefore, we can express this as:
  \[
  s = 4m - 5
  \]
  Substituting \( m = 3 \):
  \[
  s = 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7
  \]

- Let \( v \) be the number of customers kicked out for physical violence. The problem states that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence:

According to the problem, the total number of popsicles they have together is 165. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
5x + 6x = 165
\]

Combining the terms on the left side gives:

\[
11x = 165
\]

Next, we can solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 11:

\[
x = \frac{165}{11} = 15
\]

Now that we have the value of \( x \), we can find the number of popsicles each person has:

- Betty's popsicles: 
\[
5x = 5 \times 15 = 75
\]

- Sam's popsicles: 
\[
6x = 6 \times 15 = 90

According to the problem:
- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- She gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
- Therefore, the total number of apples Joanne gathers is:
  \[
  30 + 15 + x = 45 + x
  \]

Now, let's analyze how many apples her sister gathers:
- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- She gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- Her sister does not gather any apples from the average trees.

Thus, the total number of apples her sister gathers is:
\[

Now, we can set up the equation for the combined total of apples gathered by both sisters:
\[

Let:
- \( c \) = number of camels
- \( d \) = number of dromedaries

From the problem, we know:
1. Each animal has one head, so the total number of heads gives us the first equation:
   \[
   c + d = 180
   \]

2. Camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump, so the total number of humps gives us the second equation:
   \[
   2c + d = 304
   \]

Now we have the following system of equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)  (Equation 1)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \) (Equation 2)

We can solve this system step by step.

**Step 1: Solve Equation 1 for \( d \)**:
\[
d = 180 - c
\]

**Step 2: Substitute \( d \) in Equation 2**:
Substituting \( d \) from Equation 1 into Equation 2:
\[
2c + (180 - c) = 304
\]

**Step 3: Simplify the equation**:
\[
2c + 180 - c = 304
\]
\[
c + 180 = 304
\]

**Step 4: Solve for \( c \)**:
\[
c = 304 - 180
\]
\[
c = 124
\]

**Step 5: Substitute \( c \) back to find \( d \)**:
Now substitute \( c \) back into Equation 1 to find \( d \):
\[

\[
d = 56

   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day for 4 days.
   - Distance for the first 4 days = \( 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \).

2. **Next 2 Days:**
   - Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days.
   - 30% of 800 km = \( 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \).
   - So, for the next 2 days, he traveled a total of 240 km.

3. **Next Day (Day 7):**
   - On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for this day is 0 km.

4. **Second Week (Days 8 to 14):**
   - During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days.
   - Distance for the second week = \( 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \).

   - Therefore, she only pays for 1 pack:
   \[
   \text{Cost after BOGO} = 4.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Applying the coupon**: 
   - She has a $2.00 coupon.
   - So, the total cost after applying the coupon is:

2. \( L = D + 7 \) (Lily found 7 more than David)
3. \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \) (David found half of what Bodhi found)

Now, we can substitute \( L \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \) into the first equation.

From equation 3, we can express \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
\[
D = \frac{1}{2}B
\]

Now substitute \( D \) into equation 2 to find \( L \):
\[
L = \frac{1}{2}B + 7
\]

Now substitute both \( L \) and \( D \) into equation 1:
\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}B + 7\right) + \left(\frac{1}{2}B\right) + B = 43
\]

Combine like terms:

1. **Determine the width of the rug**:
   - The chair is 3 feet wide.
   - The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair.
   - Therefore, the width of the rug is:
     \[
     \text{Width of rug} = \text{Width of chair} + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet}

gsm8k,gsm8k-505,TrustRoute,1,"To determine the maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make with his budget of $24, we need to analyze the costs and the number of sticks produced from each type of wood.

1. **Cost and Stick Production:**
   - A **2 x 4** costs **$4** and produces **200 sticks**.
   - A **2 x 8** costs **$6** and produces **400 sticks**.

2. **Cost per Stick:**
   - For **2 x 4**: 
     \[
     \text{Cost per stick} = \frac{4}{200} = 0.02 \text{ dollars per stick}
     \]
   - For **2 x 8**: 
     \[
     \text{Cost per stick} = \frac{6}{400} = 0.015 \text{ dollars per stick}
     \]

From the calculations, we see that the **2 x 8** is cheaper per stick.

3. **Maximizing the Number of Sticks:**
   - If Frederick buys only **2 x 8** pieces:
     - The maximum number of **2 x 8** pieces he can buy with $24:
     \[
     \text{Number of 2 x 8 pieces} = \frac{24}{6} = 4
     \]
     - Total sticks from 4 pieces of **2 x 8**:
     \[
     4 \times 400 = 1600 \text{ sticks}
     \]

4. **Considering a Combination:**
   - If he buys **2 x 4** pieces, he can buy:
     \[
     \text{Number of 2 x 4 pieces} = \frac{24}{4} = 6
     \]
     - Total sticks from 6 pieces of **2 x 4**:
     \[
     6 \times 200 = 1200 \text{ sticks}
     \]

5. **Mixed Strategy:**
   - If he buys **3 pieces of 2 x 8** ($18) and **1 piece of 2 x 4** ($4):
     - Total cost = $18 + $4 = $22
     - Total sticks = \(3 \times 400 + 1 \times 200 = 1200 + 200 = 1400\) sticks.

   - If he buys **2 pieces of 2 x 8** ($12) and **3 pieces of 2 x 4** ($12):
     - Total cost = $12 + $12 = $24
     - Total sticks = \(2 \times 400 + 3 \times 200 = 800 + 600 = 1400\) sticks.

6. **Conclusion:**
The maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make by buying only **2 x 8** pieces is **1600 sticks**.

We can express the height of the beanstalk after \( n \) days using the formula:

- One angle is twice the smallest angle: \( 2x \)
- One angle is three times the smallest angle: \( 3x \)

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so we can set up the equation:

\[
x + 2x + 3x = 180

\]

Next, we need to find out how much Marissa makes in one hour. According to the problem, Marissa makes \( \frac{3}{4} \) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we calculate Marissa's hourly production:

Now, we can calculate how much chocolate each of them makes in 12 hours.

For Ruiz:

gsm8k,gsm8k-635,TrustRoute,1,"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we first need to calculate the maximum total cost per class that his parents are willing to pay.

Manny's total cost for the Karate classes is $60, and he has signed up for 10 classes. The cost per class is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Cost per class} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of classes}} = \frac{60}{10} = 6
\]

Since $6 is less than $10, Manny's parents will allow him to miss some classes as long as the average cost per class remains $10 or less.

Next, we need to find out how many classes he can miss while keeping the average cost per class at or below $10. Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny misses. The number of classes he attends will then be \( 10 - x \).

The total cost remains $60, but the average cost per class will change based on the number of classes attended:

\[
\text{Average cost per class} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of classes attended}} = \frac{60}{10 - x}
\]

We want this average cost to be less than or equal to $10:

\[
\frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10
\]

Now, we can solve this inequality:

1. Multiply both sides by \( 10 - x \) (assuming \( 10 - x > 0 \)):
   \[
   60 \leq 10(10 - x)
   \]

2. Distribute on the right side:
   \[
   60 \leq 100 - 10x
   \]

3. Rearranging gives:
   \[
   10x \leq 100 - 60
   \]
   \[
   10x \leq 40
   \]
   \[
   x \leq 4

This means Manny can miss up to 4 classes. If he misses 4 classes, he will attend 6 classes, and the average cost per class will be:

\[
\text{Average cost} = \frac{60}{6} = 10
\]

If he misses 5 classes, he will attend only 5 classes, and the average cost will be:

\[
\text{Average cost} = \frac{60}{5} = 12

Since $12 is greater than $10, he cannot miss 5 classes.

Let:
- \( s \) = number of sheep
- \( g \) = number of geese

From the problem, we know:
1. Each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs. The total number of legs is 70:
   \[
   4s + 2g = 70
   \]

2. Each animal has 1 head. The total number of heads is 20:
   \[
   s + g = 20

Now we have the following system of equations:
1. \( 4s + 2g = 70 \)
2. \( s + g = 20 \)

We can solve this system step by step.

First, we can simplify the first equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[
2s + g = 35
\]

Now we have:
1. \( 2s + g = 35 \)
2. \( s + g = 20 \)

Next, we can solve the second equation for \( g \):
\[
g = 20 - s
\]

Now, we can substitute \( g \) in the first equation:
\[
2s + (20 - s) = 35
\]

Simplifying this gives:
\[
2s + 20 - s = 35
\]
\[
s + 20 = 35
\]
\[
s = 35 - 20
\]
\[
s = 15

   - Good days: 12
   - Bad days: 8
   - Neutral days: The rest of the days.

3. **Calculating Neutral Days**:
   - Total days = Good days + Bad days + Neutral days
   - Neutral days = Total days - (Good days + Bad days)
   - Neutral days = 30 - (12 + 8) = 30 - 20 = 10

5. **Total Good Days**:
   - Initially, Christina had 12 good days.

1. \( K = M - 5 \)
2. \( M = C + 12 \)
3. \( S = M + 23 \)

We can start by substituting \( K \) into the first equation:

\[

Now, solve for \( M \):

\[
M = 68 + 5 = 73

Next, we can use \( M \) to find \( C \) using the second equation:

Substituting \( M = 73 \):

1.  **Calculate the cost of the lollipops Manolo bought:**
    *   Manolo bought 5 lollipops at $0.40 each.
    *   Cost of lollipops = 5 * $0.40 = $2.00

2.  **Calculate the cost of the candies Manolo bought:**
    *   The total cost for 5 lollipops and 4 candies was $3.20.
    *   Cost of candies = Total cost - Cost of lollipops
    *   Cost of candies = $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20

3.  **Calculate the cost of one candy:**
    *   Manolo bought 4 candies for $1.20.
    *   Cost per candy = $1.20 / 4 = $0.30

4.  **Calculate the cost of 10 lollipops:**
    *   Cost of 10 lollipops = 10 * $0.40 = $4.00

5.  **Calculate the cost of 10 candies:**
    *   Cost of 10 candies = 10 * $0.30 = $3.00

6.  **Calculate the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies:**
    *   Total cost = Cost of 10 lollipops + Cost of 10 candies
    *   Total cost = $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00

Topher's shoe length is 8 feet and 4 inches. We convert this to inches:

1. Convert feet to inches:
   \[
   8 \text{ feet} = 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ inches}

So, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches.

Next, we set up the equation based on the information given in the problem. Let \( b \) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. According to the problem, the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. This can be expressed as:

1. **Giant cubes**: Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water. If Peter makes 3 giant cubes:
   \[
   \text{Water used for giant cubes} = 3 \text{ cubes} \times 4 \text{ ounces/cube} = 12 \text{ ounces}
   \]

2. **Medium cubes**: Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water. If Peter makes 7 medium cubes:
   \[
   \text{Water used for medium cubes} = 7 \text{ cubes} \times 2 \text{ ounces/cube} = 14 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Small cubes**: Each small cube uses 0.5 ounces of water. If Peter makes 8 small cubes:
   \[
   \text{Water used for small cubes} = 8 \text{ cubes} \times 0.5 \text{ ounces/cube} = 4 \text{ ounces}

Next, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water Peter had:
\[
\text{Water left} = \text{Initial water} - \text{Total water used}

1. **Driving Speed and Time:**
   - The average driving speed is 50 miles per hour.
   - The total time for the trip is 6 hours.
   - The time spent hiking is 1.5 hours.
   - Therefore, the time spent driving is:
     \[

\]

Now, let's express the scores for Ava and Emma:

**Ava's score:**
\[
\text{Score}_a = 10E_a + 5B_a + 30T_a
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( E_a \), \( B_a \), and \( T_a \):
\[
\text{Score}_a = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(B_e + 3) + 30(T_e - 4)
\]
\[
= 10E_e + 80 + 5B_e + 15 + 30T_e - 120
\]
\[
= 10E_e + 5B_e + 30T_e - 25
\]

**Emma's score:**
\[
\text{Score}_e = 10E_e + 5B_e + 30T_e
\]

Now, we can find the difference between Ava's and Emma's scores:
\[
\text{Score}_a - \text{Score}_e = (10E_e + 5B_e + 30T_e - 25) - (10E_e + 5B_e + 30T_e)
\]
\[
= -25
\]

Thus, the difference between Ava's and Emma's scores is:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Score}_a - \text{Score}_e = -25
\]

This means Ava's score is 25 points lower than Emma's score. Therefore, the final answer is:

**The difference between their two scores is 25 points, with Emma having the higher score.**",0.006301850000000001,24.349082708358765,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,

1. **Normal Riding Days**: 
   - They ride thrice a day for 5 days.

2. **Extra Riding Days**: 
   - On the two other days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days.

gsm8k,gsm8k-783,TrustRoute,1,"Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \( x \) and the number of white fish he bought as \( y \).

Initially, Bob had:
- 3 orange fish
- 4 white fish

After buying the fish, the total number of orange fish becomes \( 3 + x \) and the total number of white fish becomes \( 4 + y \).

According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish. This can be expressed with the equation:

\[
3 + x = 2(4 + y)
\]

Additionally, we know that Bob bought a total of 17 fish:

\[
x + y = 17
\]

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. \( 3 + x = 2(4 + y) \)
2. \( x + y = 17 \)

Let's solve the first equation:

\[
3 + x = 8 + 2y
\]
\[
x - 2y = 5 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]

Now we can rewrite the second equation:

\[
x + y = 17 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\]

Now we can solve these equations simultaneously. From Equation 2, we can express \( x \) in terms of \( y \):

\[
x = 17 - y
\]

Now substitute \( x \) in Equation 1:

\[
(17 - y) - 2y = 5
\]
\[
17 - 3y = 5
\]
\[
-3y = 5 - 17
\]
\[
-3y = -12
\]
\[
y = 4
\]

Now that we have \( y \), we can find \( x \):

\[
x = 17 - y = 17 - 4 = 13
\]

Thus, Bob bought:
- 13 orange fish
- 4 white fish

Therefore, the number of white fish Bob bought at the store is \( \boxed{4} \).",0.0037465500000000004,19.163676261901855,0,0,cand-gpt-4o-mini,stage2_vote,

gsm8k,gsm8k-806,TrustRoute,1,"To find the overall pass rate for Herbert Hoover Elementary School, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students tested across all grades.

1. **Third Graders:**
   - Total third graders: 500
   - Passed third graders: 340

2. **Fourth Graders:**
   - Total fourth graders: 100
   - Passed fourth graders: 40

3. **Fifth Graders:**
   - Total fifth graders: 400
   - The pass rate for fourth graders is \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.4 \) or 40%.
   - Therefore, the pass rate for fifth graders is twice that: \( 2 \times 0.4 = 0.8 \) or 80%.
   - Passed fifth graders: \( 0.8 \times 400 = 320 \)

Now, we can calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students tested:

- **Total Passed:**
  - Third graders: 340
  - Fourth graders: 40
  - Fifth graders: 320
  - Total passed = \( 340 + 40 + 320 = 700 \)

- **Total Students:**
  - Third graders: 500
  - Fourth graders: 100
  - Fifth graders: 400
  - Total students = \( 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 \)

Finally, we calculate the overall pass rate:

\[
\text{Overall Pass Rate} = \frac{\text{Total Passed}}{\text{Total Students}} = \frac{700}{1000} = 0.7

   where \( b \) is the number of cards Becca has.

3. The total number of cards is 341:
   \[
   b + s + p = 341
   \]

Now, we can substitute \( s \) and \( b \) in terms of \( p \) into the total equation.

Substituting \( s = 3p \) into the equation for \( b \):
\[
b = 3p + 12
\]

Now substitute \( b \) and \( s \) into the total:
\[
(3p + 12) + (3p) + p = 341
\]

Combine like terms:
\[

\[
s = 3p = 3 \times 47 = 141

1. **Green Eggs**: Cindy has 5 green eggs.
   \[
   \text{Green eggs} = 5
   \]

2. **Blue Eggs**: She has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs.
   \[
   \text{Blue eggs} = 2 \times \text{Green eggs} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

3. **Pink Eggs**: She has one fewer pink egg than blue eggs.

gsm8k,gsm8k-827,TrustRoute,1,"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book back and the amount she will receive from Amazon as a refund.

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
   - The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.

   **Shipping cost calculation:**
   \[
   \text{Shipping cost} = (\text{weight} \times \text{cost per pound}) + (\text{distance} \times \text{cost per mile})
   \]
   \[
   \text{Shipping cost} = (4 \, \text{pounds} \times 0.35 \, \text{dollars/pound}) + (20 \, \text{miles} \times 0.08 \, \text{dollars/mile})
   \]
   \[
   \text{Shipping cost} = (4 \times 0.35) + (20 \times 0.08)
   \]
   \[
   \text{Shipping cost} = 1.4 + 1.6 = 3.0 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the refund from Amazon:**
   - The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price.

   **Refund calculation:**
   \[
   \text{Refund} = \text{purchase price} \times 0.75
   \]
   \[
   \text{Refund} = 32 \times 0.75 = 24 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate Milly's total loss:**
   - To find out how much money Milly will lose, we subtract the refund from the shipping cost.

   **Loss calculation:**
   \[
   \text{Loss} = \text{Shipping cost} - \text{Refund}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Loss} = 3.0 - 24
   \]
   Since the refund is greater than the shipping cost, Milly will not lose money in the traditional sense, but rather she will have a net gain from the refund after accounting for shipping.

   However, if we consider the total out-of-pocket expense:
   \[
   \text{Total out-of-pocket expense} = \text{Shipping cost} + \text{Cost of book} - \text{Refund}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total out-of-pocket expense} = 3.0 + 32 - 24 = 11.0 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

Thus, Milly effectively loses $11.00 when considering the shipping cost and the refund she receives.

   - Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
   - Therefore, Saskay can lift: 
     \[

3. **Kagiyami's lifting ability**: 
   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
   - Therefore, Kagiyami can lift:

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - We know that 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway. 
   - Since they are traveling at the same speed, we can say that the time taken is independent of the number of kangaroos. Thus, the time taken for any one of the kangaroos to cross the highway is also 18 hours.

2. **Calculate the distance:**
   - Let the speed of a kangaroo be \( v \) (in some distance units per hour).
   - The distance \( d \) they cover can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     d = \text{speed} \times \text{time}
     \]
   - For the kangaroos, the distance is:
     \[
     d = v \times 18
     \]

3. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - The turtles travel at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of a turtle is:
     \[
     \text{speed of turtle} = \frac{v}{2}
     \]

4. **Calculate the time it takes for the turtles to cross the highway:**
   - Using the distance \( d \) we calculated earlier, we can find the time \( t \) it takes for the turtles to cross the highway:
     \[
     t = \frac{d}{\text{speed of turtle}} = \frac{d}{\frac{v}{2}} = \frac{2d}{v}

1. **Time for each group:**
   - Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
   - Performance time: 6 minutes
   - Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes

   Total time for each group = 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes

2. **Intermission time:**

3. **Total concert duration:**
   - The concert is 2 hours long, which is equivalent to 120 minutes.

4. **Total time used for groups and intermission:**
   - Let \( n \) be the number of groups performing. The total time used for \( n \) groups is \( 10n \) minutes.
   - Including the intermission, the total time used is \( 10n + 10 \) minutes.

5. **Setting up the equation:**

- Your sister's age is \( x - 2 \) (since you are two years older than her).
- Your mom's age is \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \) (since her age is one less than three times your brother's age).

Now, we can set up the equation for the total ages:

Now, simplify the equation step by step:

   The mom's age becomes:
   \[
   3(x + 3) - 1 = 3x + 9 - 1 = 3x + 8

2. Now, substitute back into the total age equation:

1. Julie sold 14 glasses of lemonade.
2. The total number of glasses sold by all three (Julie, Micah, and Mitchell) is 32 glasses.
3. Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses.

Let \( x \) be the number of glasses sold by Micah. Since Mitchell sold the same amount as Micah, he also sold \( x \) glasses.

Now, we can set up the equation based on the total sales:

\[
14 + x + x = 32

This simplifies to:

\[
14 + 2x = 32

   - Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total.

2. **Cost of chicken**: 
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. 
   - Since 5 packs of bacon cost $10, the cost of one pack of bacon is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of one pack of bacon} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Therefore, the cost of one packet of chicken is:
     \[

3. **Cost of strawberries**: 
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, each priced at $4. Therefore, the total cost for strawberries is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of strawberries} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Cost of apples**: 
   - Each pack of apples is priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries. Since a pack of strawberries costs $4, the cost of one pack of apples is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of one pack of apples} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost for apples is:

1. **Total cups of tea**: Lana has 27 cups of tea in total.

2. **Cinnamon tea cups**: She brews a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. 

3. **Remaining cups for chamomile and mint tea**: 
   \[
   \text{Remaining cups} = \text{Total cups} - \text{Cinnamon tea cups} = 27 - 15 = 12 \text{ cups}
   \]

4. **Dividing the remaining cups into rows**: Lana divides the remaining 12 cups into 3 rows. Since she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, we can denote the number of chamomile cups in each row as \( x \) and the number of mint cups in each row as \( x \) as well.

5. **Total cups in each row**: Since there are 3 rows and each row has \( x \) chamomile cups and \( x \) mint cups, the total number of cups in each row is:
   \[
   2x \text{ (chamomile + mint)}
   \]
   Therefore, for 3 rows, the total number of cups is:

From the problem, we have the following equations:

1. The total number of Pokemon caught:
   \[
   A + S + D = 339
   \]

2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan:
   \[
   A = S + 5
   \]

3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe:
   \[
   S = 4D - 13
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( S \) into the first equation.

Substituting \( A \) into the total equation:
\[
(S + 5) + S + D = 339
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2S + D + 5 = 339
\]
Subtracting 5 from both sides gives:
\[
2S + D = 334 \quad \text{(Equation 4)}
\]

Next, we can substitute \( S \) from Equation 3 into Equation 4. From Equation 3, we have:
\[
D = \frac{S + 13}{4}
\]
Substituting this into Equation 4:
\[
2S + \frac{S + 13}{4} = 334
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 4:
\[
8S + (S + 13) = 1336
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
9S + 13 = 1336
\]
Subtracting 13 from both sides gives:
\[
9S = 1323
\]
Dividing by 9:
\[
S = 147
\]

Now that we have \( S \), we can find \( A \) and \( D \).

Using \( S = 147 \) in the equation for \( A \):
\[
A = S + 5 = 147 + 5 = 152
\]

Now, using \( S = 147 \) in the equation for \( D \):
\[
D = \frac{S + 13}{4} = \frac{147 + 13}{4} = \frac{160}{4} = 40
\]

Finally, we can verify:
\[
A + S + D = 152 + 147 + 40 = 339
\]

Thus, the number of Pokemon Stan has caught is:

   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 10 hours = 300 miles

2. **Second leg of the journey (north)**:
   - Time: 2 hours

2. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. The remaining flights can be calculated as:
   \[
   x - \frac{3}{4}x = \frac{1}{4}x
   \]
   Since these remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is:

   - Alessandro's age = 4 years
   - Let Helene's age be \( H \).
   - Let Wilfred's age be \( W \).

2. **Calculate the total age of the children**:
   The total age of the children is given as 20 years. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   3 + 4 + H + W = 20
   \]
   Simplifying this gives:
   \[
   H + W = 20 - 7 = 13 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
   \]

3. **Use the information about Helene's age**:
   Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Average age} = \frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
   \]
   Since Helene is twice this average, we have:
   \[
   H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}

4. **Substitute Equation 2 into Equation 1**:
   Now we can substitute \( H = 10 \) into Equation 1:

- \( r \) is the rate of increase (as a decimal),
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) (initial price),

1. **Large Jelly Beans**: Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans**: Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans. Therefore, the number of medium-sized beans he can eat is:
   \[
   2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ medium jelly beans}
   \]

3. **Small Jelly Beans**: It is given that eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean. Therefore, to find out how many small beans are equivalent to the 150 medium beans, we can set up the following relationship:
   \[
   1 \text{ medium bean} = 3 \text{ small beans}

Now, we can set up the equation based on the total amount shared among the three people:

\[
x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920
\]

Now, let's simplify the equation step by step:

1. Combine the terms:
   \[
   x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   4x + 240 = 1920

2. Subtract 240 from both sides:
   \[
   4x = 1920 - 240

   \[

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls (four more than in the second set).
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls (half as many as in the second set).

The total number of tennis balls retrieved in all three sets is given as 19. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Now, let's simplify this equation step by step:

1. Combine like terms:
   \[
   2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
   \]

2. To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 2:
   \[
   2(2x + 4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2 \cdot 19
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   4x + 8 + x = 38
   \]

3. Combine the \( x \) terms:
   \[
   5x + 8 = 38
   \]

4. Subtract 8 from both sides:

The total amount of fence they have is 100 feet, which gives us the equation:

\[
S + H = 100
\]

Substituting \( H \) with \( S + 60 \) in the equation:

\[
S + (S + 60) = 100
\]

This simplifies to:

   - Shaken sodas: 2
   - Unshaken sodas: 6

7. **Total Remaining Sodas**: The total number of remaining sodas is \(2 + 6 = 8\).

8. **Probability Calculation**: The probability that Ellen's friend picks a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of remaining sodas:

1.  **Find the speed of the second train:**
    The first train travels at 60 miles per hour.
    The second train travels at half that distance per hour, so its speed is 60 mph / 2 = 30 mph.

2.  **Calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours:**
    *   **Train 1:** Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles
    *   **Train 2:** Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 3 hours = 90 miles

3.  **Calculate the total distance apart:**
    Since they are traveling in opposite directions, you add the distances they each traveled.

Next, let’s denote the number of eggs painted by Sarah as \( y \). According to the problem, Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so we can express Camden's painted eggs as:

- Sarah: \( y \)
- Camden: \( y + 12 \)

We also know that Camden and Sarah together painted a total of 30 eggs, which gives us the equation:

\[
y + (y + 12) = 30
\]

Simplifying this equation:

\[
2y + 12 = 30
\]

Subtracting 12 from both sides:

\[

2. The distance walked on the sidewalk is 1 mile.
3. The time spent walking on the beach is 40 minutes.

First, we need to convert the time spent on the beach into hours since the speeds are in miles per hour.

Now, we can find her speed on the sidewalk:

\[

Let \( T \) be the temperature of the second mug of water.

   - Mug 1 (33 degrees): 4 ounces
   - Mug 2 (unknown temperature \( T \)): 1 ounce

2. **Final Mixture**:
   - Total volume of the mixture = 4 ounces + 1 ounce = 5 ounces
   - The final temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees for Donny to drink it.

3. **Setting Up the Equation**:
   The formula for the final temperature \( T_f \) of a mixture is given by:
   \[
   T_f = \frac{(m_1 \cdot T_1) + (m_2 \cdot T_2)}{m_1 + m_2}

   where:
   - \( m_1 = 4 \) ounces (mass of the first mug)
   - \( T_1 = 33 \) degrees (temperature of the first mug)
   - \( m_2 = 1 \) ounce (mass of the second mug)
   - \( T_2 = T \) (temperature of the second mug)

   Plugging in the values, we get:
   \[
   T_f = \frac{(4 \cdot 33) + (1 \cdot T)}{4 + 1}

1. **Calculate the number of scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate:**
   Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops:
   \[
   23 - 5 = 18 \text{ scoops}
   \]

2. **Determine how many potatoes are needed for 1 scoop of mashed potatoes:**
   It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes:
   - 3 less than 6 is:
   \[
   6 - 3 = 3 \text{ potatoes}
   \]
   - 1 less than 3 scoops is:
   \[
   3 - 1 = 2 \text{ scoops}

   Therefore, 3 potatoes are needed to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

3. **Calculate the number of potatoes needed for 1 scoop:**
   If 3 potatoes make 2 scoops, then the number of potatoes needed for 1 scoop is:
   \[
   \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = 1.5 \text{ potatoes per scoop}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of potatoes Gomer ate:**
   Gomer ate 18 scoops, so the total number of potatoes he ate is:

- Let \( r \) be the length of the red rope.
- Let \( b \) be the length of the blue rope.
- Let \( y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope:
   \[
   r = 4b
   \]

2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope:
   \[
   b = y - 7
   \]

3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters:
   \[
   r + b + y = 37
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( r \) and \( b \) into the combined length equation.

Substituting \( r = 4b \) into the combined length equation:
\[
4b + b + y = 37
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
5b + y = 37
\]

Next, we can substitute \( b = y - 7 \) into this equation:
\[
5(y - 7) + y = 37
\]
Expanding this gives:
\[
5y - 35 + y = 37
\]
Combining like terms results in:
\[
6y - 35 = 37

Adding 35 to both sides:
\[

\[
y = 12

2. **Amount Given to Little Sister**:
   - Let \( x \) be the amount of money that both Ronnie and Rissa gave to their little sister.

3. **Rissa's Remaining Money**:
   - After giving \( x \) dollars to her little sister, Rissa has \( 15 - x \) dollars left.
   - According to the problem, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original amount, which is \( \frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12 \) dollars.

   \[
   W = 5(C + 7)
   \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now:
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
   \]

Now we have a system of two equations. Let's solve them step by step.

### Step 1: Simplify the first equation
From the first equation:
\[
W = 5(C + 7) = 5C + 35
\]

### Step 2: Substitute \( W \) into the second equation
Now, substitute \( W \) in the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35)
\]

### Step 3: Clear the fraction
Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5C + 35
\]
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

### Step 4: Rearrange the equation
Now, rearranging gives:

\]
\[

The total distance Phineas needs to cover is 200 yards. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, we can calculate:

- Distance on land = \( \frac{200 \text{ yards}}{2} = 100 \text{ yards} \)
- Distance in water = \( \frac{200 \text{ yards}}{2} = 100 \text{ yards} \)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to hop on land and swim in water.

1. **Time to hop on land:**
   - Speed on land = 20 yards per minute
   - Time on land = \( \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \)

2. **Time to swim in water:**

1. **First 30 seconds**:

2. **Next 30 seconds**: 
   - Number of kernels popped = 3 times the first amount = \(3 \times 20 = 60\)

3. **Next 30 seconds**: 
   - Popping rate increases to four times the initial rate (which was 20).
   - Number of kernels popped = \(4 \times 20 = 80\)

4. **Final 30 seconds**: 
   - Popping slows down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds (which was 80).
   - Number of kernels popped = \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\)

Now, let's sum up the total number of kernels popped during the cooking time:

\[

Calculating this:

\[
20 + 60 = 80

\[
80 + 80 = 160

Now, let's analyze what Igor actually gathered:

1. **Test tubes**: Igor gathered half of the requested amount:
   \[
   \text{Test tubes gathered} = \frac{T}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8

   - Therefore, Kim's amount = Alexandra's amount + $320 = $430 + $320 = $750.

3. **Sarah's amount**: 
   - Sarah raises $300.

4. **Maryam's amount**:

   - Let \( v \) be Vanessa's speed in miles per minute.
   - Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Aaron's speed is \( 2v \).

2. **Distance run**:
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles.
   - Let’s denote the distance Aaron ran as \( d_A \).

3. **Time taken by Aaron**:
   - We know that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. 
   - The time taken by Aaron can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \implies 16 = \frac{d_A}{2v}

   - Rearranging gives:
     \[
     d_A = 16 \times 2v = 32v

4. **Distance relationship**:
   - The problem states that Vanessa was able to run twice as far as Aaron. Therefore:
     \[
     4 = 2d_A
     \]
   - Substituting \( d_A \) from the previous equation:
