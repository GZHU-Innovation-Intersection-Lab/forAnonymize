gsm8k,gsm8k-205,Oracle,1,"I need to find what score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after removing her lowest score.

**Given information:**
- First five test scores: 89, 71, 92, 100, 86
- Mr. Bert drops the lowest score before calculating the average
- Target average: 93
- Need to find: score on the sixth test

**Step-by-step solution:**

Let me call the sixth test score **x**.

All six scores will be: 89, 71, 92, 100, 86, x

After taking the sixth test, the lowest score will be dropped. I need to consider different cases based on what x is.

**Case 1: If x ≥ 71**
Then 71 would be the lowest score and gets dropped.
The five scores used for the average would be: 89, 92, 100, 86, x

For an average of 93:
(89 + 92 + 100 + 86 + x) ÷ 5 = 93

(367 + x) ÷ 5 = 93

367 + x = 465

x = 98

Since 98 ≥ 71, this case is valid.

**Case 2: If x < 71**
Then x would be the lowest score and gets dropped.
The five scores used would be: 89, 71, 92, 100, 86

Average = (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86) ÷ 5 = 438 ÷ 5 = 87.6

This gives an average of 87.6, which is less than 93, so this case doesn't work.

**Given information:**
- Red chickens produce 3 eggs/day
- White chickens produce 5 eggs/day
- Total eggs collected = 42 per day
- There are 2 more white chickens than red chickens

**Equations:**
1) w = r + 2 (two more white chickens than red)
2) 3r + 5w = 42 (total eggs per day)

- Let B = amount of water in the big pool now (in gallons)

**Setting up equations based on the given information:**

**Current situation (now):**
- Big pool has four times as much water as small pool
- B = 4S

**Situation 4 minutes ago:**
- Each pool loses 4 gallons/minute
- In 4 minutes, each pool lost: 4 × 4 = 16 gallons
- 4 minutes ago, small pool had: S + 16 gallons
- 4 minutes ago, big pool had: B + 16 gallons
- At that time, big pool had twice as much as small pool
- B + 16 = 2(S + 16)

**Solving the system of equations:**

From equation 2:
B + 16 = 2(S + 16)
B + 16 = 2S + 32
B = 2S + 16

Now I have two expressions for B:
- B = 4S (from current situation)

**Given information:**
- Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds
- Each truck can carry 2000 pounds maximum
- Total flagstones to transport: 80

**Step 1: Calculate the total weight of all flagstones**
Total weight = 80 flagstones × 75 pounds per flagstone
Total weight = 6,000 pounds

**Step 2: Calculate how many flagstones one truck can carry**
Flagstones per truck = 2000 pounds ÷ 75 pounds per flagstone

**Step 1: Calculate the total interest**

First, I need to determine if this is simple interest or compound interest. For short-term loans with equal monthly payments, this is typically simple interest for the loan period.

Interest = Principal × Rate × Time
- Principal = $3,650
- Rate = 10% per year = 0.10

- Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne
- Wayne's drive takes 4 minutes
- Bernadette's drive takes 4 times as long as Wayne's drive

**Step 1: Calculate Bernadette's drive time**
- Bernadette's drive time = 4 × Wayne's drive time
- Bernadette's drive time = 4 × 4 minutes = 16 minutes

**Step 2: Determine the arrival time difference**
- Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne

**Step 3: Calculate how much earlier Bernadette should leave**
- If they left at the same time:
  - Wayne would arrive after 4 minutes
  - Bernadette would arrive after 16 minutes
  - Bernadette would arrive 12 minutes AFTER Wayne

- For Bernadette to arrive 5 minutes BEFORE Wayne:
  - She needs to make up the 12-minute difference
  - Plus arrive 5 minutes earlier
  - Total: 12 + 5 = 17 minutes

**Answer: Bernadette should leave 17 minutes earlier than Wayne.**

This way:
- If Wayne leaves at time 0 and arrives at time 4
- Bernadette leaves at time -17 and arrives at time -17 + 16 = -1 (which is 1 minute before time 0, or 5 minutes before Wayne's arrival at time 4)

- Wayne arrives at minute 4
- Bernadette should arrive at minute -1 (5 minutes before minute 4 is minute -1)

gsm8k,gsm8k-443,Oracle,1,"I need to find how long it took James to complete the run portion of the triathlon.

Let me start by calculating Jon's total time and each segment.

**Jon's times:**
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes
- **Total: 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes**

**James's times:**

*Swim:* James finishes 10% faster than Jon
- 10% faster means James takes 90% of Jon's time
- James's swim: 40 × 0.9 = 36 minutes

*Bike:* James takes 5 minutes longer than Jon
- James's bike: 80 + 5 = 85 minutes

*Run:* This is what we need to find (let's call it R)

**Using the winning margin:**

Jon won by 10 minutes, which means Jon's total time was 10 minutes less than James's total time.

Jon's time = James's time - 10

170 = (36 + 85 + R) - 10

170 = 121 + R - 10

170 = 111 + R

R = 170 - 111

R = 59 minutes

**Answer: It took James 59 minutes to complete the run.**

Let me set up the problem step by step.

**Given information:**
- 3/4 of students HAVE a desktop computer
- 20 students DO NOT have a desktop computer

**Step 1: Determine what fraction don't have computers**

If 3/4 of students have desktop computers, then:
- Fraction without desktop computers = 1 - 3/4 = 1/4

**Step 2: Set up an equation**

Let x = total number of students

Since 1/4 of students don't have desktop computers, and this equals 20 students:

gsm8k,gsm8k-500,Oracle,1,"I need to find how many insects Lily found.

Let me define variables:
- Let D = number of insects David found
- Let B = number of insects Bodhi found
- Let L = number of insects Lily found

Now I'll translate the given information into equations:

1. **Total insects**: L + D + B = 43

2. **Lily found 7 more than David**: L = D + 7

3. **David found half of what Bodhi found**: D = B/2, which means B = 2D

Now I'll substitute to solve:

From equation 3: B = 2D
From equation 2: L = D + 7

Substituting into equation 1:
(D + 7) + D + 2D = 43

Simplifying:
4D + 7 = 43
4D = 36
D = 9

Now I can find the others:
- David found: D = 9 insects
- Bodhi found: B = 2D = 2(9) = 18 insects
- Lily found: L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 insects

gsm8k,gsm8k-505,Oracle,1,"I need to find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make by buying the cheapest lumber option.

Let me first calculate the cost-effectiveness of each lumber type:

**2 x 4 piece:**
- Cost: $4
- Sticks produced: 200
- Sticks per dollar: 200 ÷ 4 = 50 sticks per dollar

**2 x 8 piece:**
- Cost: $6
- Sticks produced: 400
- Sticks per dollar: 400 ÷ 6 = 66.67 sticks per dollar

The 2 x 8 is more cost-effective (66.67 sticks per dollar vs 50 sticks per dollar).

However, the problem asks for ""the cheapest lumber,"" which could mean:
1. The lumber with the lowest price per piece (2 x 4 at $4)
2. The most cost-effective lumber (2 x 8 at better sticks per dollar)

Given the context of ""saving money"" and maximizing popsicle sticks, I'll interpret ""cheapest"" as the most cost-effective option.

**If buying 2 x 8 pieces (most cost-effective):**
- Budget: $24
- Number of 2 x 8 pieces: $24 ÷ $6 = 4 pieces
- Total sticks: 4 × 400 = 1,600 sticks

**Given information:**
- 1 person can paint half a house in 5 days

**Step 1: Find how long it takes 1 person to paint a whole house**
- If 1 person paints 1/2 house in 5 days
- Then 1 person paints 1 whole house in 10 days

**Step 2: Calculate the work rate**
- 1 person completes 1 house in 10 days
- So 1 person's rate = 1/10 house per day

**Step 3: Calculate the combined rate for 5 people**
- 5 people working together = 5 × (1/10) = 5/10 = 1/2 house per day

**Step 4: Find time for 5 people to paint 1 house**
- If 5 people paint 1/2 house per day
- Then to paint 1 whole house: 1 ÷ (1/2) = 2 days

**Step 5: Convert to hours**
- 2 days × 24 hours/day = **48 hours**

Let me work through this step by step.

**Given information:**
- Ophelia has 20 sofas
- Each person has 2 fewer sofas than chairs
- Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia

**Step 1: Find Ophelia's number of chairs**

Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs:
- Sofas = Chairs - 2
- 20 = Chairs - 2
- Ophelia's chairs = 20 + 2 = 22 chairs

**Step 2: Find Jenna's number of chairs**

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia:
- Jenna's chairs = 3 × 22 = 66 chairs

**Step 3: Find Jenna's number of sofas**

Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs:
- Jenna's sofas = 66 - 2 = 64 sofas

**Step 4: Calculate the total**

Total sofas = Ophelia's sofas + Jenna's sofas = 20 + 64 = 84 sofas

Total chairs = Ophelia's chairs + Jenna's chairs = 22 + 66 = 88 chairs

**Total sofas and chairs = 84 + 88 = 172**

- Girls brought an amount equal to: (shells brought by boys) + (4 times as many shells as the boys)

**Given information:**
- Herb's house cost: $76,000
- Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's house

**Step 1: Calculate the value of Juan's house**

If Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's house, then:
- 30% of Herb's house = 0.30 × $76,000 = $22,800
- Juan's house = Herb's house - 30% of Herb's house
- Juan's house = $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

Alternatively: Juan's house = 70% of Herb's house = 0.70 × $76,000 = $53,200

**Step 2: Calculate the combined value of both houses**

- Pete buys 2 boxes

**Step 1: Calculate the discounted price per box**
- Original price: $100.00
- Discount: 10% off
- Discounted price: $100.00 × (1 - 0.10) = $100.00 × 0.90 = $90.00 per box

**Given information:**
- Total cost: $60
- Total classes available: 10
- Maximum acceptable cost per class: $10
- Parents won't sign him up again if cost per class > $10

**Setting up the problem:**

The cost per class = Total cost ÷ Number of classes attended

If Manny misses some classes, he still pays $60, but attends fewer classes, making the cost per attended class higher.

**Finding the threshold:**

For the cost per class to be exactly $10:
- $60 ÷ (classes attended) = $10
- Classes attended = $60 ÷ $10 = 6 classes

**Determining how many he can miss:**

- If he attends 6 classes: $60 ÷ 6 = $10 per class ✓ (acceptable)
- If he attends 5 classes: $60 ÷ 5 = $12 per class ✗ (too expensive)

So Manny must attend at least 6 classes to keep the cost at or below $10 per class.

**Given information:**
- Total newspapers delivered: 600
- District A: 198 newspapers
- District B: unknown (what we need to find)

**Solution:**

Since the total newspapers delivered equals the sum of newspapers delivered to all districts:

gsm8k,gsm8k-691,Oracle,1,"I need to find how much money John has left after paying the vet bill.

Let me work through this step by step.

**Given information:**
- 2 vaccines at $20 each
- Heartworm check costs 60% of the total bill
- John brought $125

**Step 1: Set up the equation**
Let's say the total bill = T

The bill consists of:
- Vaccines: 2 × $20 = $40
- Heartworm check: 0.60 × T

So: T = $40 + 0.60T

**Step 2: Solve for T**
T = $40 + 0.60T
T - 0.60T = $40
0.40T = $40
T = $40 ÷ 0.40
T = $100

**Step 3: Verify**
- Vaccines: $40
- Heartworm check: 60% of $100 = $60
- Total: $40 + $60 = $100 ✓

**Step 1: Count current stuffed animals**
- Puppies: 3
- Koalas: 5
- Zebras: 2

- Current total: 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 stuffed animals

**Step 2: Set up the equation**
Let x = number of goats to buy

After buying goats:

Now I'll translate the given relationships:

3. ""Twice as much oil as salt"": o = 2sa
4. ""Twice as much salt as zest"": sa = 2z

Now I'll express everything in terms of one variable. Let me use z (zest):

- sa = 2z (from relationship 4)
- su = sa = 2z (from relationship 2)
- o = 2sa = 2(2z) = 4z (from relationship 3)

Substituting into the total:

gsm8k,gsm8k-825,Oracle,1,"I need to find how many cards Becca has by setting up equations based on the given relationships.

Let me define variables:
- Let P = number of cards PJ has
- Let S = number of cards Smendrick has
- Let B = number of cards Becca has

Now I'll translate the given information into equations:

1. **Total cards**: B + S + P = 341

2. **Becca has 12 more than Smendrick**: B = S + 12

3. **Smendrick has 3 times what PJ has**: S = 3P

Now I'll solve by substitution:

From equation 3: S = 3P, so P = S/3

Substituting into equation 2: B = S + 12

Now substitute both expressions into equation 1:
(S + 12) + S + (S/3) = 341

Combining like terms:
S + 12 + S + S/3 = 341
2S + S/3 + 12 = 341
(6S + S)/3 + 12 = 341
7S/3 = 329
7S = 987
S = 141

Now I can find Becca's cards:
B = S + 12
B = 141 + 12
B = 153

- Smendrick: S = 141
- Becca: B = 153
- PJ: P = 141/3 = 47
- Total: 153 + 141 + 47 = 341 ✓

**Given information:**
- 3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed
- Total of 18 hours combined to travel across a highway
- Need to find: time for 4 turtles at half the kangaroo speed

**Step 1: Understand what ""total of 18 hours"" means**

The key question is: does ""total of 18 hours"" mean:
- A) 18 hours combined (all 3 kangaroos together take 18 hours)
- B) 18 hours each (each kangaroo takes 18 hours)

The phrase ""a total of 18 hours"" suggests the combined interpretation, but this doesn't make physical sense - multiple animals traveling the same route independently doesn't reduce the time.

The most logical interpretation: **each kangaroo takes some amount of time to cross**, and we're told something about the total.

**Step 2: Clarify the problem**

If 3 kangaroos each take the same time to cross, and we're talking about ""a total of 18 hours,"" the most reasonable interpretation is that each kangaroo takes 18 hours (or the problem means 18 total kangaroo-hours, which would be 6 hours each).

Let me assume: **Each kangaroo takes 6 hours** (18 total hours ÷ 3 kangaroos = 6 hours per kangaroo)

**Step 3: Calculate turtle speed and time**

- Turtle speed = ½ × kangaroo speed
- Time is inversely proportional to speed
- If turtles go half as fast, they take twice as long
- Time for one turtle = 2 × 6 hours = **12 hours**

**Step 4: Time for four turtles**

Each turtle independently takes 12 hours to cross. The number of turtles doesn't change how long it takes each one.

gsm8k,gsm8k-931,Oracle,1,"I need to find Peter's age given the relationships between Peter, Paul, and Jean's ages.

Let me define variables:
- Let John's age = J
- Let Paul's age = P
- Let Peter's age = Pe

**Setting up equations from the given information:**

1. ""The combined age of Peter, Paul and Jean is 100 years old""
   - Pe + P + J = 100

2. ""Paul is 10 years older than John""
   - P = J + 10

3. ""Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age""
   - Pe = P + J

**Solving the system:**

From equation 3:
- Pe = P + J

Substitute this into equation 1:
- (P + J) + P + J = 100
- 2P + 2J = 100
- P + J = 50

From equation 2:
- P = J + 10

Substitute into P + J = 50:
- (J + 10) + J = 50
- 2J + 10 = 50
- 2J = 40
- J = 20

Now find Paul's age:
- P = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30

Now find Peter's age:
- Pe = P + J = 30 + 20 = 50

**Verification:**
- Peter: 50 years old
- Paul: 30 years old

**Given information:**
- 100 pages to the inch when stacked
- Each sheet of paper is printed on both sides
- One page is printed on each side of the paper
- The book is 1.5 inches thick

Since the measurement ""100 pages to the inch"" refers to how the pages stack up, and each sheet of paper has 2 pages (one on each side), I need to determine what this measurement actually tells us.

The key insight: ""100 pages to the inch"" means that when you stack the pages, you get 100 pages per inch of thickness. Since each sheet contributes 2 pages, this means there are 50 sheets per inch.

- Number of sheets = 50 sheets/inch × 1.5 inches = 75 sheets
- Number of pages = 75 sheets × 2 pages/sheet = **150 pages**

Let me work through this step by step:

**Given information:**
- Courtney reported: 48 people
- Courtney overstated by 20% (according to Kelly)

**Understanding ""overstated by 20%"":**
If Courtney overstated by 20%, this means Courtney's number is 20% MORE than the actual number.

gsm8k,gsm8k-963,Oracle,1,"I need to find how many Pokemon Stan has caught.

Let me define variables:
- Let A = number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught
- Let S = number of Pokemon Stan caught
- Let X = number of Pokemon Alex caught

Now I'll translate the given information into equations:

1. **Together they have caught 339 Pokemon:**
   X + S + A = 339

2. **Alex has caught 5 more than Stan:**
   X = S + 5

3. **Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe:**
   S = 4A - 13

Now I'll solve by substitution:

From equation 3: S = 4A - 13
So: A = (S + 13)/4

From equation 2: X = S + 5

Substituting into equation 1:
(S + 5) + S + (S + 13)/4 = 339

Multiply everything by 4 to eliminate the fraction:
4(S + 5) + 4S + (S + 13) = 1356
4S + 20 + 4S + S + 13 = 1356
9S + 33 = 1356
9S = 1323
S = 147

Let me verify:
- Stan caught: S = 147
- Adelwolfe caught: A = (147 + 13)/4 = 160/4 = 40
- Alex caught: X = 147 + 5 = 152

**Given information:**
- Initial price: $120
- Annual increase: 5% of the original price
- Time period: 3 years

**Step-by-step solution:**

Let me clarify the problem first. The phrase ""5% of the original price every year"" means the price increases by 5% × $120 = $6 each year (simple increase based on original price).

**Year 0 (Initial):** $120

**Year 1:** $120 + (5% × $120) = $120 + $6 = $126

**Year 2:** $126 + (5% × $120) = $126 + $6 = $132

**Year 3:** $132 + (5% × $120) = $132 + $6 = $138

Alternatively, using a formula:
Price after n years = Initial price + (n × 5% × Initial price)
Price after 3 years = $120 + (3 × 0.05 × $120)
Price after 3 years = $120 + (3 × $6)
Price after 3 years = $120 + $18
Price after 3 years = **$138**

**Answer: $138**

Note: If the problem intended compound interest (5% of the current price each year), the answer would be $120 × (1.05)³ = $138.915 ≈ $139, but the wording ""5% of the original price"" suggests simple increase.",0.006075,7.929014921188354,0,0,claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,,,0

Let me think through this step by step by identifying when Marcus WILL have to turn in homework.

Marcus will have to turn in homework only if ALL of the following happen:
1. The normal teacher comes in (not a substitute)
2. The teacher doesn't give everyone an extension
3. Marcus can't convince the teacher about the dog excuse

Let me calculate the probability of each:

**Step 1: Normal teacher comes in**
- Probability of substitute = 50%
- Probability of normal teacher = 50%

**Step 2: No class extension (given normal teacher is there)**
- Probability of class extension = 40%
- Probability of NO class extension = 60%

**Step 3: Marcus can't get personal extension (given no class extension)**

- Probability Marcus does NOT get personal extension = 80%

**Final Calculation:**
Since all three conditions must happen for Marcus to turn in homework, I multiply the probabilities:

P(must turn in homework) = P(normal teacher) × P(no class extension) × P(no personal extension)

P(must turn in homework) = 0.50 × 0.60 × 0.80

Let me define variables for each set:
- Let x = number of balls retrieved in the second set
- First set = x + 4 (four more than the second set)
- Third set = x/2 (half as many as the second set)

Now I'll set up an equation using the total:

First set + Second set + Third set = 19

(x + 4) + x + (x/2) = 19

Combining like terms:
x + 4 + x + x/2 = 19
2x + x/2 + 4 = 19
(4x + x)/2 + 4 = 19
5x/2 + 4 = 19

Solving for x:

**Given information:**
- Initial price in 2007: $20,000
- Depreciation rate: 21% per year
- Time period: 2007 to 2010

**Step-by-step solution:**

When something depreciates at a constant rate, it retains (100% - depreciation rate) of its value each year.

- Depreciation rate = 21%
- Retention rate = 100% - 21% = 79% = 0.79

**Number of years:**
From 2007 to 2010 = 2010 - 2007 = 3 years

**Formula for depreciation:**
Price after n years = Initial price × (retention rate)^n

Price in 2010 = $20,000 × (0.79)³

**Calculation:**
- (0.79)³ = 0.79 × 0.79 × 0.79
- 0.79 × 0.79 = 0.6241

**Step 1: Determine how much butter Dennis needs**
- 1 pound of butter = 1 dozen croissants
- He needs 6 dozen croissants
- Therefore, he needs 6 pounds of butter

Let me denote the original amount of meat as x kilograms.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **T-Rex ate half:** 
   - T-Rex ate: x/2
   - Remaining: x/2

2. **Velociraptors ate half of what was left:**
   - Velociraptors ate: (x/2)/2 = x/4

**Given information:**
- Original budget: $16
- Already spent before today: $4
- Bought 2 books today (both cost the same amount)
- Money left after buying the books: $2

**Step 1: Calculate how much money Anna had before buying the 2 books today**
Money available before today's purchase = Original budget - Already spent

- Mug 2: unknown temperature (let's call it T)
- He mixes 4 ounces from Mug 1 with 1 ounce from Mug 2
- The mixture is drinkable (at least 40 degrees)

**Solution:**

When mixing liquids, the final temperature is the weighted average based on the volumes:

Final temperature = (Volume₁ × Temp₁ + Volume₂ × Temp₂) / (Volume₁ + Volume₂)

Substituting the known values:
Final temperature = (4 × 33 + 1 × T) / (4 + 1)
Final temperature = (132 + T) / 5

Let me work through this step by step:

**Given information:**
- Initial amount (5-year-old): 50 fruits
- 6-year-old: 3 times the initial amount
- 7-year-old: 7 times the initial amount
- 8-year-old: 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old
- 9-year-old: 0 fruits (no production)
- 10-year-old: 20 times the initial amount

**Calculating fruits for each year:**

- **5-year-old:** 50 fruits

- **6-year-old:** 3 × 50 = 150 fruits

- **7-year-old:** 7 × 50 = 350 fruits

- **10-year-old:** 20 × 50 = 1,000 fruits

Let me define variables:
- Let b = length of blue rope (in cm)
- Let y = length of yellow rope (in cm)
- Let r = length of red rope (in cm)

Now I'll translate the given information into equations:

**Given information:**
1. ""The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope""
   - r = 4b

2. ""The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope""
   - b = y - 7, or equivalently: y = b + 7

3. ""The 3 ropes had a combined length of 37 centimeters""
   - r + b + y = 37

**Solving:**

I'll express everything in terms of b:
- r = 4b
- y = b + 7

Substituting into the total length equation:
4b + b + (b + 7) = 37

Simplifying:
6b + 7 = 37
6b = 30
b = 5

Now I can find the red rope length:

Let me work through this step by step.

**Starting situation:**
- New chalk on Monday: 5 inches
- After Monday: Used 45% of the chalk

**After Monday:**
Chalk remaining = 5 - (0.45 × 5) = 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches

**From Tuesday onward:**
- The teacher uses 20% of the *current* chalk each day
- He must recycle when chalk < 2 inches

**Important clarification:** When the problem says ""uses 20% of the chalk each day,"" I'll interpret this as 20% of the current piece (not the original 5 inches), which is the typical interpretation for this type of problem.

**Day by day calculation:**

After Monday: 2.75 inches

**Tuesday (Day 1 after Monday):**
- Uses 20% of 2.75 = 0.55 inches
- Remaining: 2.75 - 0.55 = 2.20 inches ✓ (still > 2 inches)

Let me define variables:
- Let C = Colin's current age
- Let W = Wendy's current age

Now I'll translate the given information into equations.

**Statement 1:** ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now""
- Colin's age in 7 years = C + 7
- Wendy's current age = 5(C + 7)
- So: W = 5(C + 7)

**Statement 2:** ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now""
- Colin's age in 25 years = C + 25
- This equals one-third of Wendy's current age
- So: C + 25 = W/3

Now I'll solve this system of equations.

From equation 1: W = 5(C + 7) = 5C + 35

Substituting into equation 2:
C + 25 = (5C + 35)/3

Multiplying both sides by 3:
3(C + 25) = 5C + 35
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

gsm8k,gsm8k-1245,Oracle,1,"I need to find the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes.

Let me define variables:
- Let s = number of strawberry cubes
- Let b = number of blueberry cubes

From the problem, I can set up equations:

**Given information:**
1. The number of blueberry cubes equals 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4
   - b = 5s - 4

2. The total number of ice cubes is 116
   - s + b = 116

**Solving:**

Substitute the first equation into the second equation:
- s + (5s - 4) = 116
- s + 5s - 4 = 116
- 6s - 4 = 116
- 6s = 120
- s = 20

Now I can find the number of blueberry cubes:
- b = 5s - 4
- b = 5(20) - 4
- b = 100 - 4
- b = 96

**Verification:**
- Strawberry cubes: 20
- Blueberry cubes: 96
- Total: 20 + 96 = 116 ✓
- Is 96 equal to 5(20) - 4? Yes, 100 - 4 = 96 ✓

**What Dr. Grumpus requested:**
- 16 test tubes
- 7 beakers
- 14 Petri dishes

**What Igor actually gathered:**

*Test tubes:* Half as many as requested = 16 ÷ 2 = 8 test tubes

*Petri dishes:* Two more than requested = 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes

*Beakers:* He picked up the correct number = 7 beakers

**What happened:**
- Igor gathered: 8 test tubes + 16 Petri dishes + 7 beakers
- But he lost several beakers on the way to the lab bench
- Total items that ended up on the bench: 29

**Setting up the equation:**

Let x = number of beakers lost

Let me organize the given information:
- Vanessa ran 4 miles
- Aaron completed his part in 16 minutes
- Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa
- Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron

**Step 1: Find how far Aaron ran**

If Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, and Vanessa ran 4 miles:
- Aaron's distance = 4 miles ÷ 2 = 2 miles

**Step 2: Find Aaron's speed**

Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes:
- Aaron's speed = 2 miles / 16 minutes = 1/8 mile per minute
- Or: Aaron's pace = 16 minutes / 2 miles = 8 minutes per mile

**Step 3: Find Vanessa's speed**

Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, which means:
- Aaron takes half the time per mile compared to Vanessa
- If Aaron takes 8 minutes per mile, Vanessa takes 16 minutes per mile

Alternatively:
- Vanessa's speed = (1/8 mile per minute) ÷ 2 = 1/16 mile per minute

**Step 4: Calculate Vanessa's time**

Vanessa ran 4 miles at 16 minutes per mile:
- Vanessa's time = 4 miles × 16 minutes per mile = **64 minutes**

Or using speed:
- Vanessa's time = 4 miles ÷ (1/16 mile per minute) = 64 minutes
